A couple have told of their horror after discovering an earwig inside a sealed bag of bread rolls picked up on their weekly supermarket shop. Jane Naisbett, who bought the rolls at an Asda Superstore in Sunderland while shopping with her partner Gary MacPhail, said she was 'terrified' when she spotted the bug as she prepared to make some sandwiches. 'If I was partially sighted I might have eaten it,' the 53-year-old said. Shock: The couple say there is no way the earwig could have got into the bag after they brought it home as it was still completely sealed . The disgusted couple, from Hendon in Sunderland, complained to the store on the Leechmere Road Industrial Estate, but Asda bosses say they could not fully investigate because the pair did not leave the item with them. An inspection has since been carried out at the bakery but the supermarket said it found no evidence of insects. Ms Naisbett and her partner Mr MacPhail, a 47-year-old council worker, said they bought the rolls fresh on Monday and put them straight into their freezer when they got home. After removing them to defrost on Wednesday the couple say they found the earwig lurking inside the bag. Disgust: Gary MacPhail and Jane Naisbett, seen with the bread rolls, say they will be taking their business elsewhere . Mr MacPhail said: 'Jane lifted out the pack of rolls to make some sandwiches and when they had defrosted there was earwig inside the bag. 'The bag is still completely sealed, there's no way it could have got in there,' he added. Mr MacPhail claims he was offered a \u00a35 voucher after taking the rolls back to Asda - although the store insists he was offered a \u00a310 voucher as a goodwill gesture. His partner said she would be taking her business elsewhere. 'I've shopped there for over 20 years,' Ms Naisbett said. 'But I won't be setting foot in there again.' An Asda spokesman said: 'The quality of our products is our number one priority and we take any customer complaints incredibly seriously. 'We are at a loss to understand how this could have happened and unfortunately we were not given the opportunity to look at this product or investigate it properly. 'However, a thorough inspection of our bakery has found no evidence of any pests,' the spokesman added."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Naisbett and council worker MacPhail found an earwig in a sealed bread bag from Sunderland's Asda.

As the ski season gets underway, thousands of tourists will be packing their bags and heading off to the Swiss Alps to enjoy themselves on the slopes. However, one man has taken a different approach and has instead spent his time six miles above the pistes capturing these stunning photographs. Using a rented aircraft, photographer Basti Hansen took shots of\u00a0 the magnificent mountains as few people will have seen them before. Basti Hansen used a rented aeroplane in order to capture these pictures from nearly four miles above the Alps highest peak, that of Monte Rosa . Hansen took the pictures from near Locarno, a small town of roughly 15,000 people on the northern tip of Lake Maggiore . Taking off from Locarno, a small town of 15,000 people on the northern tip of Lake Maggiore, he flew to 36,000ft before taking out his camera. At that height he would have passed four miles over the Swiss Alps' highest peak, that of Monte Rosa, which stands at just under three miles high. In one photograph he captures the mountain range, which covers around 65 per cent of Switzerland, bathed in golden sunlight. Cruising along at 36,000ft Hansen would have been able to easily pass over the highest mountain in Switzerland, Dom, which has a summit of just under 15,000ft . Down below the plane the Alps, which proved an impassable barrier to men and armies throughout history, look like miniature models . In several other pictures the snowy mountain tops can be seen poking through clouds which seem to flow through the steep valleys below. In one amazing shot the curvature of the Earth can even be seen above the peaks, with the sombre darkness of space across the top of the picture. While the ski season can start as early as November and last until May, most Swiss resorts open during December with skiing running through until April. Here the peaks of some of Switzerland's mountains can be seen jutting through the clouds which seem to fill the valleys in between them . Every year thousands of tourists take to the Swiss slopes on skiing holidays with the industry making up 3 per cent of Switzerland's total economy . Tourism accounts for around 3 per cent of Switzerland's total economy with some of the most popular destinations being Davos, Verbier and Valais. The highest mountain to lie entirely within Swiss borders is the Dom, which rises nearly 15,000ft and is the third highest in the Alps. The town of Locarno is small but steeped in history. Excavations from the region have found burial urns dating from the bronze age, around the 14th century BC.

Cesar, who was held responsible for a blunder in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa as his side went out to the Netherlands in the quarterfinals, made two superb saves in the shootout as Brazil won its last 16 clash in a nail biting finale in Belo Horizonte. Several players, captain Thiago Silva and star player Neymar included, showed outward signs of emotion during the course of the match against Chile but Cesar told CNN that it was a natural reaction given the pressure of hosting the competition. \"We were in a situation where we could have been eliminated from the round of 16 in a World Cup in Brazil, so not only did I get emotional, but so did some of the other members of the team,\" he said. \"We know the importance of winning this World Cup in Brazil, not only for ourselves, but for our families, and especially for the fans. \"We don't know when Brazil will have another opportunity to host a World Cup, so I think we need to take advantage of this opportunity,\" added the 34-year-old. Despite his 84 caps, Cesar has had his critics and in the buildup to the World Cup finals spent an unhappy spell at English second-flight team Queens Park Rangers, before being farmed out on loan to MLS side Toronto. His place in the Brazil team appeared at risk, but Cesar credits coach Luiz Felipe Scolari with sticking with him despite his difficulties. \"I think it's the primary reason why I'm here today. Eight months ago he gave an interview saying that regardless if I was playing or not, I would playing at the World Cup. So this is something that gives you peace of mind,\" he added. Whether that peace of mind extends to the clash with Colombia and the prospect of preventing their goalscoring sensation James Rodriguez from adding to his competition leading tally of five goals is another matter. Rodriquez scored twice -- his first probably the goal of the tournament -- in his side's 2-0 last 16 win over Uruguay and Cesar admits he will be difficult to stop. \"James is a player that has been amazing everyone. I think that the World Cup gives players the opportunity to showcase their work to the world and I think James is making the most of it,\" he said. \"For now, though, I hope that against Brazil, he can halt his continued progression as a player until after the tournament has ended, because Brazil has to win.\" Brazil has its own trump card in Barcelona's Neymar, who has impressed Cesar with his mature performances despite carrying the hopes of a nation. \"You see a 22-year-old in his first World Cup in Brazil taking to the pitch as if he were playing with his friends in the street. In my opinion, that's his biggest strength,\" said Cesar. \"He's just like any other guy and I think his family is the main reason why he has accomplished so much, and yet remained humble. I think he's a fantastic kid.\" The last eight clash in Fortaleza could well hinge on which of the young superstars can put their imprint on the proceedings, while Cesar will be hoping to avoid the sort of error that haunted him during his last appearance at this stage of the competition four years ago."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Julio Cesar, Brazil's goalkeeper, has overcome a past World Cup blunder and club career struggles to become a national hero.

He aroused intense hatred from his enemies and profound admiration from his followers. He had strong opinions, took bold, risky actions. He made brilliant moves and disastrous mistakes. Sharon stood at the center of the greatest disputes, the most feverish controversies in the country's history. And then he stunned the world with a radical change of heart. The brazen right-wing hardliner remains a target of hatred for many in the Arab world. And yet, when he suffered a devastating stroke in 2006, he had undergone a breathtaking political conversion. Once a major proponent of the plan to build Jewish settlements in territories captured during the 1967 Six Day War, he had decided it was time for Israel to withdraw from much of the territory. As he told the New York Times' William Safire in 2004, he didn't believe the Palestinian leaders would respect a peace agreement, but he didn't want Israel to rule over millions of Palestinians. So, he said, \"I discussed this between me and myself and came up with a new initiative.\" Initially, nobody liked his idea very much. \"In Israel, the right does not like me to do it, and the left cannot do it,\" he said, \"but you don't wait forever.\" Despite bitter protests from his former allies and stiff resistance from the settlers, he carried out the \"Disengagement\" in 2005, removing every single settler and every Israeli soldier from the Gaza Strip. And he cryptically spoke of more \"painful compromises\" to come. \"We yearn for peace with our neighbors,\" he said to Israelis, \"even at the price of painful concessions.\" There is every reason to believe he was preparing to withdraw Israeli settlements from much of the West Bank, as well. Had Sharon stayed in office, the Israel-Palestinian conflict would look very different today. Sharon embodied the Israeli dilemma of how to obtain peace while maintaining security. As he had predicted years earlier, the withdrawal from Gaza ultimately turned the territory into a launching pad for attacks against Israeli towns. And yet, few Israelis wish their country still occupied the Strip. The larger-than-life prime minister helped his country survive in a deeply hostile region, where Israel's neighbors made it clear from the day the state was founded that they would find it the happiest of outcomes if the Jewish state would cease to exist. But he also drove Israel into terrible quagmires. Barely 20 years old in 1948, he sustained multiple injuries fighting in a war against half a dozen Arab countries, which attacked the moment Israel declared its independence. In 1973, when Egyptian and Syrian armies crossed into Israel on Yom Kippur, while much of the country was fasting for the calendar's holiest day, Israel appeared at risk of falling. Egyptian forces were headed for Tel Aviv. It was Sharon who devised and executed a plan to cross the Suez Canal, cut off and encircle part of the Egyptian army, a plan that helped Israel win the war and pave the road to peace. He suffered head injuries in battle but kept on fighting. Pictures of Sharon with his head bandaged while winning the war became iconic, a metaphor for a country battered, creative, resilient. He was the defense minister who carried out the withdrawal of all Israelis, including settlers, from the Sinai Peninsula in exchange for peace with Egypt. The darkest, most destructive chapter in Sharon's life unfolded in Lebanon in 1982 when he was defense minister. It is by that chapter that most Arabs remember him. Back then, Israeli civilians were coming under constant attack from the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the PLO, which had become a state-within-a state inside Lebanon. Sharon launched an invasion to remove the PLO, allying Israeli forces with Lebanon's Christian militias, the Phalangists. Israeli forces allowed Phalangist fighters to enter the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla in Beirut to clear out Palestinian militias. Instead, the Phalangists committed horrific massacres of civilians. Contrary to what many believe, Sharon had no knowledge that the massacres would occur. An Israeli commission of inquiry found that despite previous excesses by the Christian militias, Israel had concluded that Phalangist forces had reached a stage of maturity that would \"ensure that such actions would not repeat themselves.\" Given the sectarian passions, it was reckless to allow the Christian militias into the camp. The Israeli inquiry headed by the country's President of the Supreme Court, the Kahan Commission, found Sharon bore \"personal responsibility\" and recommended his removal from office. Israelis were seething at him and their government. He rejected the charges and refused to step down. Israeli peace activists launched protests to push for his removal. When a hand grenade was detonated in one demonstration, killing an Israeli protester, Sharon finally stepped down. Eventually, Sharon rose again. He had never cared much what people thought about him and was never one to follow ideological fashion. That was probably a result of his childhood. When he was born in 1928, his parents had settled in a socialist farming community, but rejected their neighbors' views on communal living. Sharon and his family were outsiders in their own home. He learned to think for himself and follow his instincts rather than the crowd. He had reached the height of his career in 2006 when it suddenly ended from a massive stroke that put him in a coma. Before his illness, Sharon had found a new path. He broke with his rightist party, the Likud, in a rift that put him on the opposite side of other hardline stalwarts such as today's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sharon created the Kadima (forward) party ahead of elections he was poised to win in a landslide. When he was incapacitated, Kadima won. His deputy Ehud Olmert became prime minister and carried on with peace talks, which ultimately foundered. Sharon had hand-picked Tzipi Livni to join him in Kadima. She is now a leading advocate of concessions for peace and member of Israel's negotiating team. Despite his missteps, Israelis trusted Sharon as a strong defender of their security. That meant that when he was prepared to take risks for peace, they were ready to join him. That's why he won elections while vowing to undertake \"painful compromises.\" That's why it was so demoralizing when he suddenly left the stage. Israelis, including Netanyahu, know that peace will not be possible without some risk-taking. The question is the extent of the danger they are prepared to accept. His life showed the complex link between security, peace and politics. And he showed once again that it is often the fiercest warriors who take risks for peace. It was another Israeli right-wing leader, Menachem Begin, who made peace with Egypt. It was Yitzhak Rabin, a respected general, who shook hands with Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn. It was Sharon, an architect of the settler movement, who said settlements had to be removed. He left a complicated legacy, defending his country from those who would destroy it, and taking on those who disagreed with his controversial views at home.

Wanted: Police want to speak to Lloyd Trainer, 24, in connection with a burglary on an antiques shop . A man wanted for questioning over a burglary at an antiques shop has fled Britain and become a rep for the firm behind the now infamous Magaluf sex video, it was claimed today. Lloyd Trainer, 24, featured on the BBC's Crimewatch less than a month ago in connection with a high-value raid on a shop in Petworth, West Sussex, in January 2012. Police said he had links to Glasgow, Surrey and London - but a Facebook profile for Trainer now says he is living in Palma de Mallorca, the capital of the Spanish holiday island. And two days after he was featured on the BBC's Crimewatch Roadshow on June 12, he posted a photo of himself smiling in a bar. According to The Sun, Trainer has been herding teenagers round the holiday resort of Magaluf for Carnage, the firm behind the now notorious sex video which was leaked online last week. A Sussex Police spokesman told MailOnline today: 'Lloyd Trainer, 24, from Surrey, is wanted for a high value burglary from an antiques shop in Petworth in January 2012. He has been wanted by police since then.' A source told the newspaper that Trainer had been 'bragging about how he has been on Crimewatch, showing people clips from the show on his phone'. The video shows 24 men receiving a sex act from an 18-year-old woman who was reportedly promised a 'free holiday' - which turned out to be the name of a cheap cocktail. It prompted horror and outrage from thousands of people on Twitter, where the firm initially revelled in the publicity. The @carnagemagalluf Twitter account, which has posted photos of teenagers slumped on the floor and others with the hashtag #exvirgin, retweeted dozens of compliments and insults about the video as publicity mounted. Boozy: Brits take part in a Carnage barcrawl yesterday. The reaction to the video does not appear to have impacted on the firm's popularity, with hundreds of people still hitting the resort's famous strip for cheap drinks . Its organisers then wrote: 'We are not responsible for the girl's actions. The girl and her eight friends bought tickets for the next barcrawl as they said it was amazing! 'All you . need to do is look at the video and you can see she clearly isn't drunk . and knows what she is doing. Definitely not forced in any way.' But . a friend of the woman in the video, from Northern Ireland, claimed she . was a born-again Christian who had 'made a terrible mistake'.

A confidential report from the Pentagon revealed that plans for over two dozen United States weapons systems were stolen by Chinese hackers.The hackers, who are reportedly employed by the Chinese government to help advance their military system, have been a growing threat for some time now.Amongst the systems stolen were those critical to US missile defenses for Europe, Asia, and the Gulf, and combat aircrafts and ships. Chinese hackers stole plans for confidential United States weapons systems including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter pictured here . The report prepared by the Defense Science Board went on to say that the hacking of US weapons systems by the Chinese poses major risks, according to The Washington Post.These risks include giving China a strategic advantage in future combat against the US. The theft of government weapon plans also allows China to save billions in development funds, while simultaneously advancing their systems in great strides. China denied the cyber-theft charges . made in the report, but President Obama is expected to bring up the . issue when he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping next month.Among the weapons compromised were the advanced Patriot missile system known as PAC-3 and the Navy's Aegis ballistic missile defense systems. Plans for combat aircrafts including the F/A-18 fighter jet, the V-22 Osprey, the Black Hawk helicopter, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter were also stolen along with the Navy\u2019s Littoral Combat Ship, designed to patrol waters close to shore.The report did not state the exact extent of the cyber-thefts or specify whether they came from computer networks belonging to the US government, or their contractors and subcontractors. Government officials say that the weapons system plans stolen by Chinese hackers could comprise future United States military revenuers. A V-22 Osprey pictured here is among the aircrafts for which plans were stolen . United States officials have had growing concerns about Chinese hacking tactics for sometime. A spokesman for the Pentagon told the newspaper in an e-mail, 'The Department of Defense has growing concerns about the global threat to economic and national security from persistent cyber-intrusions aimed at the theft of intellectual property, trade secrets and commercial data, which threatens the competitive edge of U.S. businesses like those in the Defense Industrial Base.'A public version of Defense Science Board's report noted that the recent cyber-thefts could have 'severe consequences for U.S. forces engaged in combat.'Amongst those consequences are severing US forces' communication, data corruption, weapons failures, and possible plane, satellite, and drone crashes.'If they got into the combat systems, it enables them to understand it to be able to jam it or otherwise disable it,\u201d Winslow T. Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project at the Project on Government Oversight told The Post. 'If they\u2019ve got into the basic algorithms for the missile and how they behave, somebody better get out a clean piece of paper and start to design all over again.' Chinese hackers allegedly associated with the country's government stole United States missile plans for weapons such as Patriot missile batteries (pictured here) Attempts are being made by the Pentagon to combat the escalating cyber-espionage. The government launched a program two years ago which helps defense contractors strengthen their computer firewalls. The program allows independent companies to use classified data from the National Security Agency to scan their networks for malware.However, the Chinese hackers have found ways to adapt and now are shifting their focus towards government subcontractors.The Pentagon is currently expanding their computer defense programs to respond to these new threats. In addition, independent contractors are also beginning to take precautions to prevent hacking. An official from Lockheed Martin, a top defense contractor said the company is 'spending more time helping deal with attacks on the supply chain,' of subcontractors, the Post reported. 'For now, our defenses are strong enough to counter the threat,' the official continued, 'and many attackers know that, so they go after suppliers.

Au naturelle: Victoria Beckham is thought to have chosen teardrop-shaped implants for her second operation . Evolutionary theorists call them \u2018sexual ornaments\u2019. According to\u00a0 academics, the human female bosom is unique among primates. While ape species have large breasts only during lactation, the same isn\u2019t true for us. And as they remain after menopause, they are not an indicator of fertility. So, look away now feminists... the way they look mainly serves to attract a mate. Thus, women have always drawn attention to their busts with padding, corsetry, or simply by going topless. Today, the boob job is the most . commonly performed cosmetic surgery, with more than 10,000 British women . having one last year. And as The Mail on Sunday reported last week, British breast implant manufacturer Nagor claim one in ten patients now opts for a \u2018super boob job,\u2019 increasing their bust by four or more cup sizes in a single operation. However, many women still want a more discreet option dubbed the \u2018has she or hasn\u2019t she\u2019 boob job. Miles . Berry, a plastic surgeon and co-author of the Good Boob Bible, says: . \u2018Victoria Beckham epitomises the new trend. 'She has never admitted to . surgery, but pictures show\u00a0 her breasts are incredibly supple and full \u2013 . better than in her youth.\u2019 Despite . technological and surgical advances, there are still pitfalls when . trying to choose the perfect pair. Here, experts advise how to get it . just right. IGNORE CUP SIZE . Size . is dictated by the volume of the implant and measured in cubic . centimetres (a 151cc to 250cc implant will give around a one to two-cup . size increase). If you are looking for a natural-looking boob job, . consultant plastic surgeon Patrick Mallucci\u00a0 recommends forgetting about . cup size altogether. \u2018Don\u2019t . come in saying, \u201cI am a B and I\u2019d like to be a DD\u201d. Cup size is highly . subjective. I might see 20 women measuring 34C, all with completely . different breasts,\u2019 he explains. Ultimately you want a breast which is . in proportion and the right implant that will achieve that. THE PERFECT SHAPE . In . 2011, Mallucci analysed the mathematical factors of attractive breasts, . using 100 Page 3 models, all of whom had real breasts, as research . material. The resulting . formula revealed a template for both surgeons and women considering . surgery: 45 per cent of breast volume is above the nipple; the nipple . points upwards at an average angle of 20 degrees; the upper half is . either straight or concave, and the lower half a neat, full curve. Back in the days: There was no mistaking that Victoria Beckham had a boob job eight years ago, but later had her 'chest oranges', right, swapped for a more natural looking implant . Mallucci says: \u2018The dimensions are a template, whether you are simply enlarging or lifting as well.\u2019 That said, the desire is normally to have bigger breasts. If you want a natural-looking boob job which is aesthetically ideal, there are limitations depending on your frame and anatomy. \u2018The surgeon ought to measure the width of your breast to select the implant size,\u2019 he says. Too big a width means the implant shows on top of the rib cage. \u2018As long as you stick to this rule you are close to achieving the perfect shape. Too large will never look natural.\u2019 PROJECT YOURSELF . \u2018Projection, or pertness, of the breasts is down to the shape of the implant itself,\u2019 says consultant plastic surgeon Fazel Fatah. \u2018There are different silhouettes \u2013 low, medium, high or extra-high.\u2019 \u2018The patient\u2019s physiology must be taken into account. A 20-year-old with a flat chest couldn\u2019t have an extra high projection as the skin would be too stretched,\u2019 Fatah adds. \u2018Under-filling is equally disastrous as it will make the skin sag around the implant,\u2019 says Mallucci. \u2018Post-pregnancy, you may have a deflated breast. The more skin laxity, the more projection is necessary.\u2019 Another important consideration is breast tissue and skin quality. \u2018Older or post-pregnancy skin\u00a0 may be very thin,\u2019 says Mallucci. \u2018You don\u2019t want the implant to\u00a0 show underneath.\u2019 ROUNDING UP . A round shape accounts for 82 per cent of implants in Britain. The other option is a teardrop-shaped implant. Fazel Fatah explains: \u2018The round implant looks fuller at the top, while the teardrop slopes downwards like a natural breast. \u2018Not many people have the teardrop because the surgical technique has to be very precise to avoid the implant rotating within the breast. It takes longer in theatre and the implant itself costs more, so the option is more expensive.\u2019 There can be a \u00a31,000 difference. Popular op: More than 10,000 British women had plastic surgery on their chest last year . TRY BEFORE YOU BUY . Some surgeons offer 3D imaging, but usually surgeons suggest \u2018trying out\u2019 new breasts by wearing a larger bra filled with an implant. \u2018British women want fullness at the top, or the Wonder-Bra effect,\u2019 says Mallucci. \u2018But if the breasts stay that shape when naked, they\u2019ll look a bit weird. This means limiting volume in the upper bust. You can still wear an enhancing bra afterwards.\u2019 SAFETY FIRST . \u2018Women should be as informed as possible about exactly what goes into their bodies,\u2019 says consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Michael Cadier. The most important factor is not the type of implant, but the safety record. European legislation isn\u2019t particularly stringent, but the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has approved five brands of implant. \u2018Should your surgeon not suggest one with FDA approval then there ought to be good safety data demonstrated in the form of long-term clinical follow-ups of a minimum of five years, looking at the integrity of the implant and effects on the body,\u2019 says Berry. A BOOB JOB IS FOR LIFE . \u2018The body forms scar tissue around the implant. This fibrous bag usually starts to contract after a decade, and the breast may look unnatural. If it becomes unevenly shaped it may have ruptured,\u2019 says Berry. However, as long as you have a decent implant there are no serious concerns should this happen. \u2018Women often only find out about rupture when they go for a mammogram at 50,\u2019 he adds. Once you know they\u2019re broken, they ought to be removed. Many women need reductions too. \u2018This is why a size eight woman wanting to have massive breasts is going to be in trouble,\u2019 says Fatah. \u2018The breast tissue will be very thin and when they are replaced she may be left with sagging breasts.\u2019"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the UK, 'super boob jobs' are trending, with Victoria Beckham's subtle implants as an example.

The bill, which passed in a 64-34 vote, cleared the Republican-run House of Representatives last week. It now advances to President Obama's desk to be signed into law. While the measure suspends Washington's $16.4 trillion debt ceiling through May 19, some budget analysts estimate it will give the U.S. Treasury the ability to meet all federal spending obligations through at least the end of July. In exchange for temporarily suspending the debt ceiling, the bill requires lawmakers in both chambers of Congress to pass a budget by mid-April or have their pay withheld. The requirement was added at the insistence of congressional Republicans, who wanted to highlight the failure of Senate Democrats to pass a budget resolution since 2009. Democrats note that such resolutions are not binding, and insist they would have been superseded by the 2011 Budget Control Act, which established budgetary restrictions for the last two fiscal years. Top Capitol Hill Democrats have been divided over the bill. Some railed against the pay withholding provision -- calling it a political gimmick -- while others supported the measure as a whole because it removes an immediate threat of default and at least temporarily divorces the debt ceiling from GOP spending cut demands. For their part, top Republicans have essentially conceded that a fight over raising the debt ceiling is not the best political avenue for achieving their twin deficit and spending reduction goals. Most political analysts believe that a 2011 debt ceiling fight, which led to the passage of the Budget Control Act, did not play to the GOP's political advantage. That partisan fight led to a downgrade in the gold-plated U.S. credit rating and was thought to have slowed the fragile economic recovery. Beyond the debt ceiling, the House and Senate will be forced to grapple shortly with two other polarizing budget-related deadlines. If Congress fails to act by March 1, a pending sequester will trigger roughly $1 trillion in new defense and non-defense cuts over the next decade -- cuts generally disliked on both sides of the aisle.

Scroll down for video . Two former police officers are being investigated over claims they sexually abused a former child actor at the Elm Guest House in South-West London, above, which was frequented by VIPs and politicians . Earlier this month, Home Secretary Theresa May described claims that MPs murdered and abused children at an exclusive block of flats as \u2018the tip of the iceberg\u2019 The new revelation comes amid a flood of serious allegations, including that police covered up the name of an MP who abused a child at the former guesthouse. Earlier this month, Home Secretary Theresa May described claims that MPs murdered and abused children at an exclusive block of flats as \u2018the tip of the iceberg\u2019. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday in April, Mr Towsey said he had sex with two officers who were gaining intelligence on the guesthouse prior to the June 1982 raid. Mr Towsey worked as a masseur at the guesthouse but was 16 at the time of the offences, which was under the age of homosexual consent then. He said: \u2018The first came in April and I had sex with him. \u2018He turned out to be one of the officers who later raided the house. \u2018He came back about three weeks later and hired a room. He stayed two nights and on the second night his partner stayed too. \u2018I ended up having sex with them. Afterwards they asked me \u201chow much\u201d and I told them that they were not clients and I felt insulted they wanted to pay me.\u2019 Mr Towsey, who appeared in Grange Hill and Doctor Who, was taken to Richmond police station after the raid, where, he claims, he saw the second officer. Metropolitan Police detectives launched the investigation after Mr Towsey reported the allegations to police in early 2013. It referred the matter the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), but the watchdog decided not to investigate and sent the case back to the Met. The Met\u2019s Directorate of Professional Standards is now leading the investigation, Operation Yvonne, into the former officers, who were police constables at the time of the alleged offence. Scotland Yard has refused to release their names. After the raid the guesthouse owners, Harry and Carole Kasir, were convicted of keeping a disorderly house and having obscene videos. They were given a two-year suspended sentence and fined \u00a31,000.

Police have asked Lee to give a further statement which he is doing in the next couple of weeks.\u2019 Operation Yvonne is the latest off-shoot from Operation Fernbridge, which is looking into claims children were abused at the former guest house, which is now a row of flats.Police have already confirmed the disgraced former Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith, who Mr Towsey said was one of his clients, was a visitor. Police are probing allegations VIPs preyed on boys who were brought to the guesthouse in Rocks Lane, Barnes, from a nearby children\u2019s home. It has also been suggested that police or security services covered up the name of a politician who allegedly abused a child taken into custody the night of the raid.

King, 70, ex-Radio 1 star Chris Denning, 73, and Robert Randall, a DJ at the disco, were prosecuted. Several well-known figures were arrested but not charged, including TV presenter Matthew Kelly and former Bay City Rollers manager Tam Paton. Now it can be revealed that an independent report by Merseyside Police to \u2018establish whether there were any further investigative lines of enquiry\u2019 identified a number of actions, which Surrey Police said they \u2018are now progressing\u2019. The new operation, codenamed Ravine, will draw on information from the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Operation Yewtree. Last month, Yewtree detectives secured the conviction of Denning on 40 charges against boys aged from nine to 16 in the 1970s and 1980s. He is due to be sentenced next week.

Olympia Snowe has shown throughout her career that when it comes to voting, it's her principles and constituents that guide her, not her party. Sen. Olympia Snowe has received overwhelming support from her constituents in past elections. Those principles, analysts note, are guiding her to find a compromise on health care reform currently stalemated in Congress. Jennifer Duffy, who follows the Senate for the Cook Political Report, said Snowe's independent streak is \"not new behavior for her.\" \"I think they [Republicans] also realize that the only reason that the state of Maine has two Republican senators at all is the fact that they are very independent-minded and they vote their state,\" she said, referring to Snowe and Sen. Susan Collins. In fact, some estimates place Snowe as having voted with her party only 57 percent of the time in the current Congress. While her moderate views are at odds with GOP opposition to several of President Obama's economic plans this year, the senator's constituents seem to agree with her. In 2006, she won re-election with 74 percent of the vote, compared to her Democratic opponent's 21 percent. In 2000, Snowe received 69 percent of the vote. In an interview with National Public Radio in 2006, she said that while her views are moderate, Maine, like other New England states, has been \"naturally independent\" \"Oftentimes, I tell my leadership, don't blame me, it's just where I grew up,\" she said at the time. Snowe, 59, was elected to Congress in 1978 at age 31, and served Maine's 2nd District for 16 years. She ran for Senate in 1994 and won, \"becoming the first woman in American history to serve in both houses of the state legislature and both houses of Congress,\" her Senate Web site notes. Her political career began in 1973 after her husband, Maine Rep. Peter Snowe, was killed in a car accident and she was elected to fill his seat. After two years in the state Senate, she won the U.S. House seat held by William Cohen when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1978. Snowe was elected to the Senate with 60 percent of the vote during the Republican revolution of 1994, filling the seat of longtime Democratic Sen. George Mitchell, who retired. She married then-Maine Gov. John McKernan in 1989. In 2006, Time Magazine named her one of the top 10 U.S. senators, calling her \"the caretaker.\" \"Because of her centrist views and eagerness to get beyond partisan point scoring, Maine Republican Olympia Snowe is in the center of every policy debate in Washington,\" the article read. \"But while Snowe is a major player on national issues, she is also known as one of the most effective advocates for her constituents.\" Duffy said that if Snowe and Collins started voting with the Republican leadership all the time, \"They would probably both lose re-election.\" Part of the so-called \"Gang of Six\" on the Senate Finance Committee, which includes three Democrats and three Republicans, she has been actively negotiating with the White House. The White House said that Sens. Chuck Grassley and Mike Enzi, the other two Republicans in the Gang of Six, have backed away from negotiations, although Enzi released a statement that said he is still willing to talk. Snowe said it's important to work with the other party despite criticism. \"I think sometimes, yes, I'd find myself in that position, you know, with fewer and fewer ... people who are willing to reach across the political aisle and to create what I ... call the sensible center,\" she told NPR last week. \"I mean, that's where the majority of Americans are. And I try to sort of build those ... bridges.\" Part of that bridge building was seen with her votes for the president's $787 billion economic stimulus package in February. For the past months, Snowe has been pushing the idea of a safety net plan, or \"trigger,\" for a public health care option as part of a key compromise. A source familiar with her negotiations with Obama said that's one of the things they're talking about.  Watch more on the health care debate \u00bb . The idea would give insurance companies a defined period to make changes in order to help cover more people and drive down long-term costs. But if those changes failed to occur within the defined period, a trigger would provide for creating a public option to force change on the insurance companies. \"This option would be available from day one in any state where -- after market and insurance reforms are implemented -- affordable, competitive plans still do not exist,\" she said in a press release. Her main concerns so far have been the high cost of health care proposals. \"What we have to do is develop a plan that's going to be available to people on an affordable basis, and, secondly, containing costs both for the American consumer and the American taxpayer,\" Snowe said in the NPR interview last week. Cost has been a major part of her bipartisan efforts in the Senate. \"Given the gravity of our economic circumstances, I am pleased that our bipartisan negotiations have yielded a consensus solution that will create jobs, assist the displaced and invest in our economy,\" she said at the time about the stimulus plan. She added that it is not a \"matter of labeling something as spending or as tax relief; it's finding and including in this package the vital provisions necessary for jump-starting our economy.\" CNN's Dana Bash, Ed Henry and Mark Preston contributed to this report."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sen.

And reports from Iraq's government suggest ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may have been hit in airstrikes over the weekend -- though it's not clear whether he was wounded, whose strikes he may have been hit by and in what part of the country he may have been struck. But if al-Baghdadi is dead, what would happen to the radical Sunni militant group? Don't expect ISIS to just crumble. \"It will morph, and new leaders will emerge,\" retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James \"Spider\" Marks said. \"In fact, bear in mind that ISIS leadership originated from Saddam's military. These are very conventionally trained, very professional leaders.\" Odds are al-Baghdadi or the Shura Council, which handles the group's religious and military affairs, has planned this scenario in advance. \"ISIS likely has a clear line of succession,\" said Lauren Squires of the Institute for the Study of War. \"This is a bureaucratic organization with a deep bench ... either Baghdadi has signed off on the line of succession himself or the Shura Council has agreed to a line of succession.\" Top two deputies . Al-Baghdadi has a Cabinet of advisers as well as two top deputies -- Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, who oversees ISIS' mission in Iraq, and Abu Ali al-Anbari, who is in charge of operations in Syria, according to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. Both men are veteran Iraqi military officials who served under Saddam Hussein. \"These people who had previously served in Saddam Hussein's army were extremely brutal because Saddam Hussein's regime was very brutal,\" said Peter Neumann of King's College. \"But they also inherited the disciplines and the military skills that are now benefiting ISIS in its campaign against its enemies.\" Analysts say al-Turkmani could make a strong case to become the leader of ISIS if al-Baghdadi is taken out. \"He would also have had to have a lot of outstanding qualities either in the political or the military field, and that certainly makes him a potential contender,\" Neumann said. Beneath each deputy are 12 governors for both Iraq and Syria. Those governors handle financial, military, legal, media and intelligence councils, among others. What's interesting about the bureaucratic hierarchy of ISIS is that it looks a lot like those of some Western countries whose values it rejects -- except there's no democracy involved and there's a council tasked with considering who to behead. Another possibility . Then there's Syrian Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the chief spokesman for ISIS who could also take over the group. In September, al-Adnani called for ISIS supporters to launch lone-wolf attacks. Analysts say some of al-Baghdadi's top deputies were imprisoned with the spokesman at Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run detention center in Iraq where al-Baghdadi was also held for at least four years. \"He was able to trust these individuals as sharing his ideology, sharing his hatred for the West.,\" Squires said. The Shura Council's importance . If al-Baghdadi is still alive, there's one group of people who can take him out even without the use of airstrikes or violence. The Shura Council is the religious monitor for ISIS. Not only does it make sure all the local councils and governors are sticking to ISIS' version of Islamic law, it has the ability to stand up to al-Baghdadi. \"The Shura Council has the right to tell Baghdadi to go if he's not adhering to ISIS' religious standards,\" said Jasmine Opperman of the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. \"It would most probably never happen, but the fact that it's possible indicates the council's prominence.\" She said the recent beheadings of Western hostages James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and David Haines would have fallen under the Shura council's purview. On top of that, Opperman said, the Shura Council also has the power to censure the leadership for running afoul of its interpretation of Sharia law. But what happens if al-Baghdadi dies might just be hypothetical for now. While some Iraqi officials say the ISIS leader was wounded in an airstrike, U.S. officials say they can't confirm whether al-Baghdadi was hit at all.

And in the latest speculation a number of theories have been considered including a giant iceberg and a huge field of bubbles. Speaking to MailOnline, two scientists explained their thoughts on what it might have been and that they hope to learn more upon repeated observations early next year. In this series of images from the Cassini spacecraft the giant object 100 square miles (260 square kilometres) in size is seen rising out of one of Titan's largest seas before disappearing again. In the latest image on the right the object still seems to be partially submerged beneath the surface . In July 2013 the giant feature was seen surfacing from under the liquid before partially disappearing again in August this year. Regarding the iceberg theory one scientist explains how, if it's the correct assumption, they might differ to icebergs on Earth. 'For a bit of background, on Earth it's quite a simple situation because ice floats in water,' Jason Hofgartner, a graduate student at Cornell University who works on the Cassini Radar Science Team, tells MailOnline. 'On Titan it's more complicated because you have a methane and ethane mixture, we think, and there's nitrogen from the atmosphere that also gets dissolved. The iceberg theory is one of the more favoured ones at the moment. This suggests some frozen mass, perhaps frozen methane and ethane, was dislodged from the seabed and rose to the surface. Another theory is that this may be a vast field of bubbles released by underground vents of volcanoes that are now resting on the surface. It could also be surface waves drifting across the sea, although this theory is unlikely as Titan is tidally locked to Saturn (the same face also points towards the planet) so its seas to not have tides as dramatic as those seen on Earth. One theory that that has been ruled out is that this is a land mass. Jason Hofgartner from Cornell University says if it was it would have been visible under the liquid in the previous images. 'So when you freeze it, it undergoes complicated composition changes. 'Whether you can get icebergs that can float is a matter for debate, but it's possible. 'When it warms those icebergs could switch from sinking to floating.' Hofgartner explains how the northern hemisphere, where the iceberg was spotted, is currently transitioning from spring time to summer. This process might be responsible for warming the sub-surface icebergs, which then caused them to rise from the seabed. Other processes like currents in the sea could also be dislodging such features. Another theory is that it is a bubble, although not necessarily a giant bubble across the whole feature. Hofgartner says it could be a series of smaller bubbles spread over the huge area, each perhaps just centimetres in size. The cause of these bubbles could be vents, undersea volcanoes or  seasonal changes. One theory that can be ruled out, however, is that this is some sort of giant non-ice land mass that has risen from the depths. This is because the radar system on Cassini can penetrate into the liquid so it would have spotted such a land mass. 'If this was a land mass or mud flat under the sea, we should have seen it in earlier images because the radar would have penetrated,' he explains. A comparison image from 26 April 2007 (left) shows how no similar feature was previously spotted in the region of interest.\u00a0The feature was spotted by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around the Saturnian system. On the right is an image of Titan in orbit around Saturn . Another feature of the images is that the object appears to be fading. 'I don't know if that's anything to do with what's under the liquid; we see it's decreased in brightness an extending. 'So what could be happening is it's spreading out and becoming less concentrated in one area, and spreading into a larger area.' The feature is certainly rare, although it's possible that more may be spotted in future. This specific area will be imaged by radar again early in 2015, and exactly what state the feature is in will surely be of huge interest. One of Nasa's future proposals to Titan is for a boat to sail the seas, but Hofgartner says features like this would not necessarily be a threat to such a mission. 'Perhaps the boat could help us nail down what is happening here,' he says. This is an artist's impression of the Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) capsule, a proposed mission to perform the first direct inspection of an ocean environment beyond Earth by landing in, and floating on, a methane-ethane sea on Saturn\u2019s largest moon: Titan . Speaking to MailOnline Professor of Planetary Plasma Physics Emma Bunce from the University of Leicester, who also works on the Cassini mission, agreed that it may have been some sort of iceberg akin to something we see on Earth. 'It could be something floating that sunk and came back to the surface,' she says. 'I was thinking almost like an iceberg, similar to something in Earth's oceans.' But she doesn't rule out the possibility of it being some sort of giant bubble, or even surface waves. She goes on to explain that the feature may have arisen due to the change in season at Saturn. The first image in 2007 was taken 'around Saturn equinox [when the sun is above the equator], and then the latest image is now heading towards northern summer solstice on Saturn. 'That's sort of an ongoing theme for a lot of the Cassini results; a lot of things depend on the season at Saturn as it moves in orbit. 'Because this lake itself is actually near to Titan's northern pole, perhaps it is something to do with illumination conditions.' The feature was spotted in Ligeia Mare (shown), one of the largest seas on Titan, and was observed by Cassini's radar experiment.\u00a0Several theories currently exist including surface waves, rising bubbles, floating solids, solids suspended just below the surface or 'something more exotic' according to Nasa . The feature was spotted by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft, which is currently in orbit around the Saturnian system. It was spotted in Ligeia Mare, one of the largest seas on Titan, and was observed by Cassini's radar instrument. In images from 10 July 2013 to 21 August 2014 the feature is shown rising and then falling below the surface. With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn't hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's 'water' is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180\u00b0C (-292\u00b0F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. A comparison image from 26 April 2007 shows how no similar feature was previously spotted in that region. The mysterious feature appears bright in the radar images, suggesting it has a somewhat similar composition to the land nearby in the image. This supports one theory that it may be a solid structure  that surfaced from under the liquid before sinking again for an unknown reason. The dark area in the image is the liquid hydrocarbon sea on Titan's surface, while the bright area to the right is land. Scientists on the radar team are confident that the feature is not an artifact - or flaw - in their data. They have also ruled out the possibility of it being due to evaporation, as the nearby shoreline has not changed much. Several theories currently exist including surface waves, rising bubbles, floating solids, solids suspended just below the surface or 'something more exotic' according to Nasa. The appearance of the feature may also be due to changing seasons on Titan, with summer drawing near in the moon's northern hemisphere. Monitoring these changes is a major goal of Cassini's current extended mission. 'Science loves a mystery, and with this enigmatic feature, we have a thrilling example of ongoing change on Titan,' said Dr Stephen Wall, the deputy team lead of Cassini's radar team, based at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'We're hopeful that we'll be able to continue watching the changes unfold and gain insights about what's going on in that alien sea.' It's not just Titan that is thought to have an active surface; earlier this month scientists found the first sign of geologic activity on a solar system world other than Earth - Europa. Experts from the University of Idaho and the Johns Hopkins University, Maryland, say Europa could be more Earth-like than experts imagined. The latest find appears to solve a puzzle that has perplexed planetary scientists. It shows where old crust was destroyed and how the icy crust is expanding. Many parts of Europa's surface show evidence of extension, where wide bands - up to tens of miles wide - formed as the surface ripped apart, and fresh icy material from the underlying shell moved into the newly created gap, a process akin to terrestrial seafloor spreading, according to the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience. Europa's surface is considered to be relatively young at between 40 and 90 millions of years old, which can perhaps now be explained by plate tectonics. It has been a decade since Cassini entered orbit around Saturn (illustration shown). In June the Cassini mission celebrated 10 years of exploring the planet, its rings and moons. It arrived for a four-year mission but has since been continuously extended, although it will almost certainly end in 2017 ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cassini spotted a 100 square mile feature in Titan's seas, possibly an iceberg or bubble field.

At Manchester Crown Court it was revealed that Campbell was suffering from schizoaffective disorder exacerbated by her frequent use of cannabis and legal high drugs. It led to abnormal beliefs in which she thought everyone was possessed by the devil. Details of the case emerged as Campbell, now 19, was given a life sentence and branded \u2018extremely dangerous\u2019 after she admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. She will have to serve a minimum jail term of five years after her not guilty plea to murder was accepted. She already had 18 convictions for 27 offences, including assault and robbery. Neil Usher, prosecuting, said: \u2018She said she couldn\u2019t trust anybody. She told a doctor at stage during the early hours she had took the dog for a walk. \u2018She insisted she had not gone for the purposes of killing. She had wandered the streets and found herself at his address by chance. \u2018Then she said for no reason her dog started gnawing at the trousers of the victim at which point she believed he was the devil and was trying to attack her and she had to defend herself. Shocking incident: Campbell was arrested when police were forced to overpower her with a Taser weapon . \u2018This led to the attack. She has continued to experience delusional thoughts and violence and other challenging behaviour. Her condition is exacerbated by the effects of illicit psychotic drugs including cannabis.\u2019 As well as hearing Mr Hassan\u2019s futile screams for mercy, neighbours reported Campbell telling her dog to \u2018sick him\u2019 and \u2018get him\u2019 when they contacted the police. The court heard that in the days before . the attack Campbell, who had been in care since the age of 14 but was . regaining contact with her parents, was displaying unusual behaviour. 'She can be classed as extremely dangerous. Clearly this offence is particularly grave. I say that with no hesitation' Judge Michael Henshell . She had been singing gospel songs and praising God, grabbed one man in the street and shook his head while saying \u2018he\u2019s the devil, he\u2019s the devil\u2019 and sprayed graffiti on gravestones at a cemetery. After she was sent to the medium-security Edenfield Centre in Prestwich, Manchester. following Mr Hassan\u2019s killing, she continued to act violently. Campbell even misused legal highs while under the care of staff and on another occasion attacked an elderly female resident. William Staunton, defending, conceded that Campbell was a dangerous offender and a serious risk to members of the public. He added: \u2018We can\u2019t ignore the dreadful way this man died. She appears to know she was responsible for the death of this man. \u2018While in police custody she went in to prayer and sought forgiveness. It was a brutal and frenzied attack, but one which was committed during an episode.\u2019 Response: Police were called to the flat in Longsight after neighbours heard Mr Hassan 'screaming for help' Under guidance from Dr Fareed Bashir, Campbell\u2019s psychiatrist at the Edenfield Centre, Judge Michael Henshell ruled a prison sentence would be more appropriate than a hospital order because of her risk of harm. Judge Henshell said: \u2018There were no eye witnesses to the fatal attack, but it is clear from the evidence at the scene that he must have been attacked initially in his own home and during the attack fled to a nearby house, leaving a trail of blood which stretched form his flat to the hallway of his neighbour\u2019s house. 'She said for no reason her dog started gnawing at the trousers of the victim at which point she believed he was the devil and was trying to attack her and she had to defend herself' Neil Usher, prosecuting . \u2018A neighbour heard a disturbance at 5am with sounds including him crying for help and the defendant urging the dog to attack him. When the police opened the door the scene that confronted them was truly horrific. \u2018Her appearance was that she looked deranged - her hair was matted with blood and she was breathing heavily and muttering to herself. It was clear he was already dead. \u2018There have been a significant history of behavioural problems since childhood. She began to exhibit psychotic symptoms at around the age of 16 where she could be volatile and violent. \u2018In answer to the question of dangerousness I can say most certainly she is. She can be classed as extremely dangerous. Clearly this offence is particularly grave. I say that with no hesitation. \u2018The harm here is exceptionally grave, the culpability is diminished by her mental condition. I have no hesitation that a life sentence is justified. She will be on licence for life and liable to recall at any time.\u2019 Mr Hassan had been living in Britain since 2001 but had recently been refused asylum and was looking at ways of staying in the country."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Tinika Campbell, 19, with a history of violent behavior and 18 prior convictions, killed asylum seeker Khalid Kassian Hassan under the influence of her schizoaffective disorder and cannabis use.

One of the rarest events in the universe has been seen by scientists for the first time. A stunning cosmic jet from a super-massive black hole which shredded then swallowed a star has been observed by astronomers. Known as 'relativistic jets', they can reach hundreds of thousands of light years in length. The swallowing of a star by a black hole only happens once every one hundred million years in a galaxy. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Stunning: This illustration shows plasma shooting out of the black hole after it devours a star. Such an event took place four billion light years from Earth . Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical (white, purple) and X-ray telescopes (yellow and red) showing the bursts . Most galaxies have super-massive black holes - regions of space that suck in everything nearby with their strong gravitation pull - at their core, with masses of millions or even billions of suns. Scientists were first alerted to the . phenomenon in March after Nasa's Swift telescope detected several bursts . of X-rays from a quiet patch of sky. Teams from both Pennsylvania State University and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in . Cambridge, Massachusetts, said the bursts could be the remnants of a star pulled apart when it came too close to a black hole located 3.9billion light years away. As a star falls toward a black hole, it is ripped apart by intense . tides. The gas is corralled into an accretion disk that swirls around . the black hole and becomes rapidly heated to temperatures of millions of . degrees. The innermost gas in the disk spirals toward the black hole, . where rapid motion and magnetism create dual, oppositely directed 'funnels' through which some particles may escape. Jets driving matter . at velocities greater than 90 percent the speed of light form along the . black hole's spin axis. In the case of Swift J1644+57, one of these jets . happened to point straight at Earth. Dr David Burrows, from Pennsylvania State University which controls Swift, said chemical analysis of the bright flash's ultraviolet light show it comes from material being sucked into a black hole the size of a million suns. Writing in Nature, they concluded that the Swift satellite just happened to be in the path of the jet of star remains that were shot out at 99.5 per cent the speed of light. Dr Burrows said: 'Incredibly, this source is still producing X-rays and may remain bright . enough for the Swift satellite to observe into next year. It behaves . unlike anything we've seen before.' The black hole is now believed to be even more powerful because of the additional mass from the swallowed star. The absorption of large mass such as stars or even other black holes is what gives black holes growth and spawn the existence of super-massive black holes.Super-massive black holes could contain up to billions of solar masses. By comparison, the sun is just one solar mass and the Earth is 1/332,950th of a solar mass. Black holes are probably the strangest cosmic phenomenon that we know about. Their gravity is so strong that normal laws of physics just don't apply, with time actually slowing down at a black hole's event horizon - the point at which it would be impossible to escape its clutches."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Scientists observed Swift J1644+57, a super-massive black hole, devouring a star.

As in don't wash them ... ever. Speaking at Fortune's Brainstorm Green conference, Chip said he was sporting a pair that had \"yet to see a washing machine\" in over a year. Worried about germs, you germaphobes? No problem, he says. Just stick your jeans in the freezer once a month next to the frozen waffles to kill off the bacteria. Apparently getting them icy will neutralize the sweat, coffee spills and other bodily fluids that might collect in the zipper or \"seating\" area. He also suggests spot cleaning with a sponge or a toothbrush. While that could work for the stuff on the outside of your jeans, what about all the stuff your body cooked up that's on the flip side? Once you get 'em back up to body temperature, won't you be warming up those germs again? Yuck. Jean freezing has become quite the craze in the past few years. It even comes with its own video tutorials and folding techniques posted online by bloggers around the country. Interesting, but somehow I doubt an overnight stay in the freezer is going to silence the filth festival that accumulates on a pair of jeans over the course of wearing them for 30 days straight. The only time I tried jean freezing was during a family fishing trip a few years ago in the Wind River Range. We \"washed\" a load in the river and hung a line up for our laundry to dry overnight. I woke up to unexpected frost and a pair of Carhartts that felt like plywood. If you think it's hard to pull on your jeggings, ladies, try cracking open a pair of jeans that are frozen solid. Bergh claims that not washing your jeans keeps them in mint condition and helps conserve water. Both noble pursuits. But what about conserving the cleanliness of your lower extremities and not subjecting your colleagues to the stench of dirty denim? Have you ever cooked bacon or mucked a stall in a pair of jeans? It's a gift that keeps on giving. And with this thought, it has dawned on me. He's not talking to people like my Uncle Warren, who rise with the sun to work the Angus cattle farm that's been in my family for generations. He's talking to people who like to look fancy in their jeans. The people that benefit most from not washing denim are the ones who'll throw down what is for many Americans a monthly salary to buy something they'll never wash, because, quite frankly, they'll probably be worn no more than four times before their next new pair of jeans. And listen, science says this \"freezing jean\" phenomena doesn't stand up to analysis. In plain English: No, freezing your jeans will not kill all bacteria, but throwing them in the microwave just might. Stephen Craig Cary, a University of Delaware expert on frozen microbes suggests \"you either raise the temperature to 121 degrees Celsius for at least 10 minutes or just wash them! The latter surely is the best alternative to save energy.\" He adds: \"One might think that if the temperature drops well below the human body temperature they (bacteria) will not survive, but actually many will. Many are pre-adapted to survive low temperatures.\" Then again, since much of a CEO's job is to drum up as much marketing buzz as possible, it's no wonder that Bergh is making this unsanitary claim -- thereby bringing Levi's back to the forefront of a conversation. Even if it makes him smell like a farm animal."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Levi's CEO, Chip Bergh, promoted the jean freezing trend at a conference, targeting high-end denim consumers.

With this in mind, a pair of teenagers has created a wearable band that knows when its wearer has dozed off. It then pauses and records whatever was being watched so it can be viewed later on. Scroll down for video . The KipstR band uses a pulse oximeter to establish when the wearer has fallen asleep, or wakes up again. The band then mimics a TiVo remote by pausing, recording or resuming the show that is currently being watched. Other people in the family can then change the channel without interfering with the recording . Called KipstR, the 3D-printed band was created by Manchester students Ryan Oliver, 15, and Jonathan Kingsley, 14, in partnership with Virgin Media as part of its Switched on Futures initiative. The wearable tech features a pulse oximeter, and a wireless sensor which means it can \u2018talk\u2019 to a Virgin Media TiVo box. Pulse oximetry is used to measure oxygen levels, or saturation in the blood. It is a non-invasive way of determining how much oxygen is being delivered to the part of the body where the sensor is placed. When people fall asleep, this flow of blood changes and a pulse oximeter can use these changes to recognise when someone has dozed off - and equally, when they are awake again. The current KipstR prototype (pictured) features a spark core chip, pulse-oximeter, push button, sleep mode indicator and a small LiPo battery . KipstR measures a user\u2019s heart rate to detect sleep. It then communicates with a Virgin Media TiVo box to pause and record the current programme being viewed. When the user\u2019s heart rate rises to \u2018awake\u2019 levels it triggers Virgin Media\u2019s TiVo boxes to resume the programme. The current KipstR prototype features a spark core chip, pulse-oximeter, push button, sleep mode indicator and a small LiPo battery. The spark core chip at the heart of KipstR processes all the data from the pulse-oximeter, dictating when the band triggers TiVo to record, pause or re-play. The outer casing of KipstR is 3D printed using an Objet Connex 3D Printer using a resin called Polyjet. This resin is more robust than the rigid plastics used by most 3D printers. Wearable technologies such as KipstR could also be used to monitor wearer\u2019s emotional reactions to their TV viewing, helping TiVo learn and tag programmes that evoke the strongest responses from the wearer. Virgin Media will be trialling KipstR this Christmas with customers able to register interest in KipstR from this month. It is also exploring how KipstR could sleep-control other connected devices in the home including powering up and down devices and controlling customers central heating, helping save time and money. Once KipstR establishes the wearer has fallen asleep, the band mimics a TiVo remote to pause and record the show that is currently being watched. And if the person wakes up, the show will resume. Additionally, once a show is being recorded, other people in the family can change the channel without interfering with this recording.

Catrina seems unaffected, and said they have done this for years, and described how they let the animal's blood drain for several hours. Catrina Shears, from West Michigan, posted the 43 second video of the snapping turtle's death to the social media website this week. The clip, filmed on a mobile phone, shows the teenager using pliers to pull the turtle's head out from its shell while her elder brother steps on the turtle . Then she commented that she 'should have taken a video of the blood squirting' from the turtle's neck. The posting on the video drew heavy criticism on Facebook with many saying if the siblings want to hunt and kill animals for meat the method of death should have been quicker. Other people said that 'decapitation is the humane way to kill a snapping turtle.' After several complaints the Department of Natural Resources released a statement reported Fox8.com, saying: 'We are certainly disappointed anyone would post something like that to social media. Although the actions depicted in this video are technically legal under state statute - provided that the capture of the turtle was legal - we would advocate a more rapid means of taking the animal's life. We further hope this turtle was taken for the purpose of human consumption.' Last night Catrina wrote on her Facebook page: \u00a0'Everyone who messages me saying rude things will also be reported for harassment and cyber bullying if they threaten me etc.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Catrina Shears, a 17-year-old from West Michigan, stirred controversy by sharing a video of her and her brother decapitating a live snapping turtle.

Saturday's 1-0 victory at Eintracht Frankfurt gave the Bavarian side a record-extending 22nd title since the elite division was formed in 1963, and 23rd national championship overall. With six games still to play, it marked the earliest clinching of the title -- and made Bayern the first team of any of the major European leagues to be crowned this season. The club had previously twice triumphed with four games left, in 1973 and 2003. Jupp Heynckes, who is 68 next month, became the oldest coach to win the league in what will be his second and final season in charge in his third spell at the club. Former Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola will take over at the end of this campaign, but before then Heynckes is hoping to complete an unprecedented treble of the German Cup and European Champions League -- and make amends for the disappointment of losing last year's final in Munich. \"The fact that we have won the title after 28 games is extraordinary, it's simply fantastic,\" Heynckes told reporters. \"One of the things FC Bayern have demonstrated this season is that we're a top side, but we have done it with harmony in the team. \"We can be confident we will achieve something in the Champions League.\" Bayern already have one foot in the semifinals of Europe's top club competition, taking a 2-0 lead to Italy for Wednesday's second leg against Juventus. Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger scored the only goal in Frankfurt to earn Bayern's 24th win in 28 league games this season, leaving the team 20 points clear of second-placed two-time defending champions Borussia Dortmund. Bayern's David Alaba missed a 26th-minute penalty, hitting a post after midweek scorer Thomas Muller was fouled, but Schweinsteiger scored seven minutes after halftime with a backheel from Philipp Lahm's cross to dent the home side's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. It was Bayern's 11th successive league victory since the winter break -- the first time a Bundesliga team has won so many in a row in one season. It also means Bayern will have led the Bundesliga from start to finish for the fifth time -- no other club has done it even once. Dortmund came from behind to win 4-2 at home to third-bottom Augsburg, with striker Julian Schieber scoring twice in a rare start as coach Jurgen Klopp rested key players ahead of Tuesday's Champions League home clash with Spanish club Malaga with the quarterfinal tie poised at 0-0. Third-placed Bayer Leverkusen dropped six points behind Dortmund after being held 1-1 at home by Wolfsburg, while Schalke went three points above Frankfurt with a 2-0 win at Werder Bremen. Borussia Monchengladbach went seventh with a 1-0 win over Greuther Furth that left the visiting team rock bottom and nine points adrift in the battle to avoid automatic relegation. Hamburg's European hopes were hit by a 1-0 home defeat by Freiburg, which followed last weekend's 9-2 thrashing by Bayern.

Her affair with the former secretary of state for energy and climate change became public in June 2010, with Mr Huhne leaving his wife of 26 years. The 44-year-old PR adviser sued for compensation and an injunction over 65 'highly unpleasant and hurtful' articles which have appeared since then. She claimed she was subject to 'crude and demeaning stereotypes' about her being bisexual. Dismissed: Carina Trimingham gives a statement today outside the High Court after today's hearing . But despite Ms Trimingham's lawyers claiming the stories constituted a 'cataclysmic interference' with her private life, a High Court judge today rejected her claim on the grounds that her involvement with the former energy secretary was 'a situation of her own making'. The High Court judge also said he had not found Ms Trimingham to be a good or reliable witness in a number of respects. Associated Newspapers described the ruling by Mr Justice Tugendhat as 'an important example of the press exercising its right to free speech'. Associated Newspapers had contested Ms Trimingham's case on the basis that there was an important public interest. Ms Trimingham's counsel, Matthew Ryder QC, said the Daily Mail had a right to freedom of expression but not to abuse her repeatedly under the guise of exercising that freedom. Ms Trimingham was in court today but showed no emotion as her claim was dismissed by the judge. Relationship: Chris Huhne and Carine Trimingham, pictured last September, had an affair which became public in June 2010 . He said: 'Ms Trimingham was not the purely private figure she claims to be. Her reasonable expectation of privacy has become limited. 'This is mainly by reason of her involvement with Mr Huhne, both professionally, as his press agent, and personally as his secret mistress, in circumstances where he campaigned with a leaflet to the electorate of Eastleigh about how much he valued his family. 'But it is also by reason of what she herself has disclosed in the past. 'Further, she was, as the defendant knew, a journalist who had herself disclosed information about other people for publication in the newspapers and so was a person who ought not reasonably to be expected to be distressed when such information was published about herself.' 'Ms Trimingham has shown little sign of recognising how what she herself has done has given rise to the publicity she finds so unwelcome.'The difficult situation she found herself in was of her own making. Ms Trimingham, speaking today on the steps of the High Court, was not found to be a good or reliable witness during her claim by Mr Justice Tugendhat . 'One reason why it is objectionable for a sexual relationship to arise between people who are already in a professional or work relationship is that there is then a greatly increased risk of conflicts arising between professional duty and personal interest.' It was this crossing of boundaries which led an editorial executive on the newspaper to consider that Ms Trimingham's role in the story of Mr Huhne was so significant, he added. 'Professionally, it was her job to ensure that Mr Huhne received the best possible publicity, but it was the sexual affair on which she embarked, and which she continued to conduct, with Mr Huhne that gave rise to the scandal. He added that although Associated referred to Ms Trimingham's sexuality in 65 articles over 15 months, it only did so when writing about matters of public interest - mainly developments in Mr Huhne's personal life which were relevant to his public life - and when Ms Trimingham, her conduct and other information about her were within the range of what an editor could in good faith regard as relevant to the story. 'The distress that she has undoubtedly suffered since June 19, 2010 is the result of the publication by the defendant of the defamatory and true information concerning her, about which she has not made a claim in defamation, and the actions of journalists and publishers for whom the defendant is not responsible. 'To the extent that the words complained of include insults and other offensive matter, insulting and offensive speech is protected by the right of freedom of expression. 'In this case what Ms Trimingham complains of is not so unreasonable that it is necessary or proportionate to sanction or prohibit such publications in order to protect the rights of Ms Trimingham. 'So the defendant has not harassed her within the meaning of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. It is not the case that a reasonable person in the position of the defendant ought to have known that these articles, separately, or cumulatively, amount to harassment of Ms Trimingham.' He added that Ms Trimingham had no reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to various items of information, including cropped versions of photos taken at her civil partnership ceremony, which revealed no more information about her than the public already knew. Ms Trimingham was not the purely private figure she claims to be. Her reasonable expectation of privacy has become limited.' Outside court, Ms Trimingham said she intended to appeal. Ms Trimingham, who is insured, was ordered to pay \u00a3250,000 towards Associated\u2019s costs. A spokesman for Associated Newspapers said: 'This was an important example of the press exercising its right to free speech in relation to matters of significant public interest. A High Court judge told Ms Trimingham, pictured left today and right at the Lib Dem Annual Conference last September, that she was in a situation 'of her own making' 'We are pleased that the Court agreed with us and has today dismissed all of Miss Trimingham\u2019s complaints. 'The references to Miss Trimingham\u2019s sexuality in our coverage were never pejorative, private or in any way homophobic. 'Miss Trimingham chose to level some very serious charges against our journalists in this case. This judgement vindicates both our journalists and their journalism. Media law specialist Mark Stephens said Mr Justice Tugendhat, in his judgment, had drawn a distinction between private and public figures by importing the American notion of a public figure. 'It is redolent of the approach taken to Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky,' he said. 'Mr Clinton, as president, had a restricted zone of privacy, and Ms Lewinsky's zone of privacy was reduced by virtue of her relationship with him. 'It appears that that ratio was very similar in this case.'

In an opinion piece on FoxNews.com today, Defense Department alumni J.D. Gordon claims, 'Al Qaeda terrorists at Guantanamo treated better than our vets.' 'Yes, it\u2019s true. I know because I served as a Pentagon spokesman from . 2005-2009 and visited Guantanamo Bay Naval Base over 30 times during . those years,' he writes. Former Pentagon Spokesman J.D. Gordon, left, says the suspected terrorists being held at U.S. military facilities in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are provided with better medical care than America's veterans. Gordon is pictured here at the U .S. Naval Base at Gitmo on July 15, 2009 . In this photo, then-Pentagon Spokesman J.D. Gordon, right, walks with courtroom sketch artist Janet Hamlin, left, CNN's Carol Cratty, center, and U.S. military personnel on the way to the courthouse for a U.S. Military Commissions hearing at Camp Justice, the site of the U.S. war crimes tribunal compound, at Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base, Cuba on July 15, 2009 . Gordon is a retired Navy commander who served as a\u00a0 Defense Department spokesman under both presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. After departing the Pentagon, he entered the realm of politics. In 2012 he served as an adviser to pizza magnate Herman Cain's bid for the Republican presidential nomination. He is now a national security and foreign policy commentator and a Senior Fellow and Communications Adviser to several right-leaning organizations in Washington, D.C. He is also the Executive Director of a national security-based conservative political action committee called Protect America Today that he helped found in 2012. In his op-ed on Fox's website, Gordon calls on the nation's Commander-in-Chief to 'refocus his priorities' on America's veterans and spend 'less time, effort and energy caring for Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees . at Gitmo and much more attention put on caring for America's veterans.' His op-ed points to\u00a0a Joint Task Force Guantanamo fact sheet on Detainee Medical Care as evidence that the approximately 150 terrorists at Gitmo are taken care of by 100 health care providers. 'Doctors and medical personnel are at their beck and call,' Gordon writes. 'Got a . cold, a fever, a toothache, a tumor, chest or back pain, mental health . issues, PTSD? No problem, come right in. Military doctors are waiting to see\u00a0you.' The Joint Task Force Guantanamo fact sheet claims the 'medical care provided to detainees at Guantanamo is consistent with what U.S. service members receive.' 'JMG providers administer care to all detainees regardless of disciplinary status, level of cooperation or legal status,' it says. 'Detainees are treated at dedicated medical facilities with state-of-the-art equipment and an expert medical staff.' The one-pager also notes that health services are available to suspected terrorists at Guantanamo Bay 'around the clock, seven days a week. Meanwhile, only one doctor is provided for every 35 veterans enrolled in the Veterans Affairs health care program and the VA's 267,930 employees, Gordon writes. 'If any government entity ever needed a complete overhaul, it\u2019s the . VA,' he says. 'If it were in the private sector, it would have been shuttered long . ago.' Gordon argues that both presidents Bush and Obama allowed the VA to spiral out of control, citing VA officials' big salaries, big bonuses and big budgets for decorating, but zeros in on the current office holder for sitting on his hands for the last five and half years. 'Instead of fixing the problem' with veterans' care, the Obama's administration's ' focus was closing Guantanamo . and improving the comfort of detainees. Even though they already lived . under some of the best prison conditions ever seen.' Gordon, who is a veteran himself, says the government ought to be giving its countrymen and women who fought in uniform the same level of medical care than its giving to assumed terrorists. 'Our veterans have served the nation proudly. In many cases they were . gravely wounded during their service and now will require a lifetime of . medical support. Every one of them deserves better.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "J.D.

Hesburgh, who led the University of Notre Dame to national academic prominence and became an influential figure in both the spiritual and political worlds, has died. He was 97. Hesburgh died Thursday. His death was confirmed by a posting on the university's website. \"We mourn today a great man and faithful priest who transformed the University of Notre Dame and touched the lives of many,\" said the Rev. John I. Jenkins, Notre Dame's current president, in a statement. \"With his leadership, charisma and vision, he turned a relatively small Catholic college known for football into one of the nation's great institutions for higher learning. In his historic service to the nation, the Church and the world, he was a steadfast champion for human rights, the cause of peace and care for the poor.\" Over the course of a career that spanned more than seven decades -- 35 of them as president of Notre Dame -- Hesburgh ended up at the highest levels of both church and state. He marched with civil rights leaders. He was instrumental in giving influence to the laity at Catholic universities. He was a Vatican representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency. He was an adviser to presidents, serving on commissions concerning civil rights, immigration and military clemency issues. (And, incidentally, angering Richard Nixon over a report about racial discrimination, which prompted Hesburgh's resignation.) In 1962, he made the cover of Time magazine -- back when that was one of mainstream America's most powerful indicators of influence -- for a story about Catholic intellectuals. He was even one reason that the former Eppie Lederer ended up as advice columnist Ann Landers. As she told the story, when she applied for the position, she was given a handful of letters to answer as a test. For help on some topics she called her friends, including Supreme Court justice William O. Douglas and Hesburgh. Needless to say, she got the job. Hesburgh, a close friend, remained one of the column's go-to experts. But Hesburgh's primary focus was always the school he loved and first attended when he was 16. At the time -- the mid-1930s -- the college in South Bend, Indiana, was known for its football team, its seminary and little else. Hesburgh, a native of Syracuse, New York, graduated from a university in Rome, Italy, and was ordained in 1943. He wanted to become a military chaplain but ended up pursuing a doctorate at Washington's Catholic University. He returned to Notre Dame after the war and became head of its Theology Department, rising in its administration. He made his passions clear even before he became president, clashing with football coach Frank Leahy.

Its famous mural, visible from Notre Dame's football stadium, is referred to as \"Touchdown Jesus.\" And when he started at Notre Dame, its endowment was $9 million. Today it stands at close to $10 billion, the 12th-largest in the country. \"The great challenge ... at Notre Dame was to create the greatest Catholic university of all time. And I think we achieved that,\" he told Maureen McFadden of South Bend TV station WNDU, a CNN affiliate. There was criticism, of course. He traveled so much he became the subject of a campus joke: God is everywhere, Hesburgh is everywhere but Notre Dame. He disliked the Vietnam-era campus protests and threatened to expel students who were too disruptive. He sometimes butted heads with Catholic leaders. But he was, usually, beloved -- not least by the Notre Dame community. He was known for his availability to students and liked to chat with them. Perhaps his greatest influence \"was on the lives of generations of Notre Dame students, whom he taught, counseled and befriended,\" said Jenkins, the Notre Dame president, in his statement. He was amply honored during his long life. He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal and more than 100 honorary degrees. For all his influence, Hesburgh never saw himself as high and mighty. His calling was service, and that alone was enough. \"I never wanted to be anything but a priest, which is in itself a great and unearned grace,\" he said. \"I hope to live and die a priest, nothing more, but nothing less either.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Father Theodore M.

While many agreed with his view that BBC coverage of the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee river pageant was \u2018cringingly inept\u2019, they said it was wrong to single out presenters rather than bosses. Others took to the internet to describe his remarks in a Mail on Sunday article \u2013 which saw him call the presenters \u2018airheads\u2019 \u2013 as cruel and accused him of being grumpy. 'Ashamed of the BBC 'Michael Buerk called presenter Tess Daly\u00a0 'a pneumatic bird-brain from Strictly' In an end-of-year comment piece, the 66-year-old former newsreader argued that the spectacle of the Queen\u2019s Diamond Jubilee was \u2018betrayed\u2019 by the BBC\u2019s dumbed-down coverage. \u2018The one enduring British institution [the Monarchy] was mocked by another that had shamefully lost its way,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018On the screen, a succession of Daytime airheads preened themselves, or gossiped with even more vacuous D-list \u201ccelebrities\u201d. With barely an exception, they were cringingly inept.\u2019 He then focused on Miss Daly\u2019s talent as a news presenter. He said: \u2018The Dunkirk Little Ships, the most evocative reminders of this country\u2019s bravest hour, were ignored so that a pneumatic bird-brain from Strictly Come Dancing could talk to transvestites in Battersea Park. \u2018I was so ashamed of the BBC I would have wept if I hadn\u2019t been so angry.

Just not good enough: Michael Buerk was highly critical of the BBC's coverage of the Diamond Jubilee - which included Tess Daly . One wrote on the BBC\u2019s Points Of View message board: \u2018I did agree ... but was mystified as to why it was mainly aimed at the indians instead of the chiefs.\u2019 Another said while it was \u2018generally agreed\u2019 the BBC \u2018failed miserably\u2019 in the coverage, to turn it into an attack on the presenters rather than those in charge was \u2018wrong\u2019.

A couple who took their children out of school so they could have their first family holiday in five years risk being jailed after refusing to pay fines introduced under controversial new laws. Stewart and Natasha Sutherland will appear before Telford Magistrates' Court tomorrow after they took their three children to the Greek island of Rhodes during the school term. The couple were given an initial fine of \u00a3360 after the family of five went away for seven days at the end of September, but were unwilling to pay. The penalty then doubled to \u00a3720 because they did not pay the fee within 21 days. The Sutherland family: (left to right) Sian, 13, mother Natasha, Keane, six, father Stewart and daughter Rhiannon, 15 on holiday in Rhodes . Now the week-long break could cost the couple up to \u00a32,000, while they also face the prospect of a three-month prison sentence. The family booked the holiday in October 2012, before the new guidelines were put into force on September 1 least year. Before they went away, the couple were warned they each risked a \u00a360 fine for taking their six-year-old son, Keane, and their daughters Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, on the break. Mr Sutherland, 39, who works for the Ministry of Defence Guard Service, said, the family struggle to fit in a regular holiday and were desperate to get away. \u2018It\u2019s like a revolving door in our house - I come in from work and my wife goes out.' he said. \u2018We haven\u2019t been able to get leave in the school holidays at the same time for five years, and we desperately needed a family break. Paradise: The family of five went to the Greek Island of Rhodes, a destination popular with British tourists . \u2018I work in a sensitive job where . staffing levels have to be maintained - there\u2019s been a recruitment and . overtime ban and it\u2019s been impossible to arrange summer leave that fits . in with the rest of the family. \u2018I . know how important education is - but there\u2019s a bigger picture. Family . time is important, too, and the children\u2019s behaviour and schooling has . improved massively since our holiday together.\u2019 The amendments to school attendance regulations ended a policy which let schools grant up to 10 days leave a year for family holidays. Headteachers now are not obliged to give pupils leave during term time, expect in 'exceptional circumstances.' Now, according to Section 444 of the Education Act, 1996, parents are legally required to send their children to school on a regular basis, and failure to do so can land them a fine or prison sentence. Youngest: Their six-year-old son Keane was taken out of Donnigton Wood Primary School in Telford . Mr Sutherland added \u2018I informed the school after the summer holidays that we were taking the children out for six days. At that point, I wasn\u2019t even aware of the new legislation. \u2018We had a letter back warning that as the time off was not authorised we could be fined, but the holiday was already booked and paid for - what could I do? \u2018I\u2019ve since become aware that other parents just lie and tell the school their kids are ill, but I was upfront from the outset and raise my children to be honest. \u2018I\u2019ve even heard of local schools . advising parents to say their children are sick to avoid getting fined. What kind of lesson does that teach them - that it\u2019s OK to lie and be . deceitful?\u2019 The couple are . arguing that the education authority has no appeal process and they have . no choice but to go to court to have their say. Older children: Their daughters Sian, 13, and Rhiannan, 15, both attend Sutherland Business and Enterprise College in Telford . Mr Sutherland said: \u2018This is not about the fine or the cost of the holidays outside of school term, it is about the principle. I could not have holiday any other time. \u2018We spoke to the school attendance officer and things looked hopeful that the fines would be quashed. \u2018But the next day we had an email back saying once a fine had been issued, it couldn\u2019t be withdrawn. \u2018I asked the attendance officer to put herself in our shoes - the kids go back to school and their friends ask where they\u2019ve been over the holidays. \u2018They have to say 'nowhere, my dad was working. The local authority issues a penalty notice to parents who fail to ensure their kids attend school. It equates to \u00a360 per child, rising to \u00a3120 if it's not paid within 21 days. After 28 days, if the fine remains unpaid, the local authority is required to begin legal proceedings in a magistrate's court. The couple are being prosecuted under Section 444 of the 1996 Education Act, subsections one and eight.The two parts refer to a parent's failure to secure regular attendance at school of registered pupil. If a child of compulsory school age fails to attend the school regularly, his parent is guilty of an offence. If the parent knows that his child is failing to attend regularly at the school and fails without reasonable justification to cause him to do so, he is guilty of an offence. If a person is guilty to any of the above offences they are liable on summary conviction with punishments ranging from a fine to a three-month prison sentence. The guidelines apply to all state-funded schools. 'I told the attendance officer they were trying to deprive children of having a holiday and I was told I\u2019d deprived them of six days education and should feel guilty. \u2018We are their parents; it should be up to us. I have no concerns over any of my children or their level of education. They are all in the top sets, and we believe quality family time is just as important as schooling. \u2018We are bringing our children up to value their education, we know how important it is, but we are being punished for three things, because we work full-time, the fines are double because we are married, and finally because we were honest enough to tell the school the truth about the holiday instead of simply saying the kids were ill.\u2019 Kay Burford, attendance support team leader for Telford & Wrekin Council said the new legislation is clear and any time off is disruptive to a child\u2019s education. She said: \u2018Our policy supports new legislation which makes it clear that head teachers may not grant any leave of absence during term time unless there are exceptional circumstances. \u2018Leave in term-time which results in significant absence from school is disruptive to the child\u2019s education and has a detrimental impact on attainment. There is no automatic right to any leave or holiday in term time. The regulations clearly make the point that the headteacher has the final decision as to whether to authorise the leave or not. \u2018The Telford & Wrekin Council LA Policy Statement has been developed within the context of the national and local priority of raising the educational achievement and attainment of pupils. The Government has renewed appeals to parents not to take their children out of school during term time.\u2019 A Department for Education spokesman said: 'Poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging . effect, and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more . likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent. 'That is why we have given schools more power to tackle . poor attendance and allowed them to intervene much earlier. We have also . increased the amount parents can be fined for unauthorised absences and cut the . amount of time they have to pay. 'Parents should never simply discount a possible penalty . notice from the cost of a cheaper holiday, because this is a criminal offence . and when doing so they are always risking prosecution'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Sutherlands face a potential \u00a32,000 fine and jail time under Section 444 of the Education Act, 1996, for taking their children to Rhodes during term.

'Worse than hell' in typhoon-ravaged Philippines . 'We don't have anything to eat' As they searched for loved ones lost in the storm, desperate survivors asked for help. \"Our house got demolished,\" one woman told CNN affiliate ABS-CBN. \"My father died after being hit by falling wooden debris. We are calling for your help. If possible, please bring us food. We don't have anything to eat.\" A man begged for forgiveness because he couldn't save his daughter from the typhoon's wrath. \"We all got separated from each other when the strong waves hit,\" he told ABS-CBN. \"We got separated. I couldn't even hold on to my child.\" Another man said he was still trying to find six family members. \"My child has been buried in that island,\" he said. 'I'm going to die' Shirley Lim still remembers the sounds she heard as the storm struck. The wind was so strong, she said, it sounded like someone was crying. \"It's like the movie 'Twister,'\" she said. Speaking to CNN Monday from the city of Coron, Lim said one thought ran through her mind during the storm: \"I'm going to die.\" But Lim survived. Many homes in Coron were severely damaged by the typhoon, she said, as the howling winds ripped roofs off houses made of light material like bamboo. Prison inmates threaten breakout . A man stands on a rooftop, threatening to jump. He is one of 672 inmates at a Tacloban prison, where food and water supplies ran out on Monday. Now, the prison's warden says the inmates have given him a warning, threatening a mass breakout in one or two days if they don't get food and water. From the prison's rooftop, the inmate says he is devastated -- but he doesn't mention food or drink. He says he doesn't know what happened to his family during the storm.

Fear spreads . Richard Young wears a green whistle on a plastic strap around his neck. He has been carrying it since Saturday night when small groups started forming to defend his neighborhood. They stayed up all night, he says, prepared to whistle if they saw any looting. But whistles aren't the only thing they have, he says. Many also are carrying weapons. \"As long as they don't harm my kids, my family, that's OK,\" he says. \"But once we are threatened, we will shoot. All of us, we are ready.\" Already, the Filipino businessman says he's been shocked at the looting he's seen in the city -- not just food, he says, but large appliances like refrigerators and washing machines. Thieves, he says, have already ransacked his shop and others nearby. \"We are very afraid. ... In Tacloban we are almost 98% Catholics, and I can't believe they did this,\" he says. \"Nobody would think it's going to be lawlessness.\" 'We were just floating' Tacloban City Councilor Cristina Gonzales-Romualdez and her husband, Mayor Alfred Romualdez were at their home facing the Pacific Ocean when the storm surge came, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported Tuesday. Suddenly, water burst into the home and rose so quickly, the people inside had to punch holes in the ceiling and climb to the second floor to avoid being swept away, Gonzales-Romualdez told the network. She found herself worried she would be swept out to sea. \"We were just floating, I was holding on to my kids,\" she said. Bodies everywhere . Days after the storm hit, bodies remain everywhere, some crudely covered, others exposed to the burning sun, CNN's Paula Hancocks reports. Two bodies, one large and one small, lay under what appeared to be a bus shelter below a sign with the phrase, \"I (heart) Tacloban.\" Officials tell Hancocks they are focusing on the living, but the bodies pose a health risk to survivors. \"The stench is overpowering,\" she said. Shocked by the devastation . Sebastian Rhodes Stampa knows devastation. The U.N. disaster assessment team chief has been to some of the worst crisis zones in the world. The devastation from Typhoon Haiyan simply took his breath away when he set foot in Tacloban. \"I have to say, I was caught by surprise,\" he said Monday. \"Just getting off the military transport and looking at the airport, it almost wasn't there. It was utterly destroyed.\" Traveling the region, he has seen huge boats thrown from the sea well up onto shore, and buildings knocked flat by the towering storm surge. In all, he said, these are scenes of \"appalling devastation and tragedy.\" Checkpoints on crucial road . Police checkpoints appeared Monday on the 9-mile (15-kilomter) road from the airport to Tacloban. Officers told Hancocks that desperate residents looking for food and water had been jumping onto trucks leaving the airport. But CNN's Andrew Stevens spent three to four hours in bumper-to-bumper traffic on the airport road and saw no aid trucks. \"We're still going past dead bodies, we're still going past a shattered landscape,\" he reported.

Hospital without supplies . A hand-drawn sign at the front of St. Paul's Hospital in Tacloban gives a sense of the dire situation there. \"No admissions,\" it says. \"No supplies.\" Interactive map of the storm . Without electricity at the large private hospital in this storm-ravaged city, workers used headlamps for light as they performed emergency first aid on victims who streamed in with wounds from flying debris. \"We just can't keep going,\" one doctor says. \"There's just no supplies.\" Children ripped from arms . Searching for family lost in the storm . Splintered wood beams cover the ground where roads once connected a neighborhood near the coastline. Here, the storm surge plowed down homes, leaving behind mounds of rubble as far as the eye can see. Authorities pleaded with residents in the coastal area to evacuate as the storm approached. It's unclear how many did, and how many may be missing. Amid the chaos, one man says he is searching for his father, brothers and uncles under the rubble. \"We all tried to leave, but it was too late,\" he says. \"I got separated when the waters started rising. I don't know what happened to them.\" Devastation for miles . From the air, the damage to Tacloban is striking. Forests of palm trees were mowed down on hills surrounding the city. Inside the city, the damage is catastrophic. The storm surge shoved massive freight ships ashore. Many buildings were flattened. Those that weren't had large chunks ripped away by ferocious waters and winds from the storm. William Hotchkiss, general director of the Philippines' Civil Aviation Authority, says he's never seen anything like it in decades of flying over the country after storms.

Fellow churchmembers say they served as a family for Esmin Green, shown in 2007, after she left Jamaica. Green, 49, is shown rolling off a waiting room chair at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on June 19. She lands face-down on the floor, convulsing. Surveillance video captures her lying on the floor for more than an hour as several hospital workers see her and appear to ignore her. She died there. But to fellow members of her church, she was known as \"Sister Green.\" Together, they served as a family for her in the decade after she left Jamaica for New York. Green left six children in Jamaica -- the youngest now 14. She had been sending money home.  Watch 'Sister Green' in church \u00bb . Her oldest daughter, 31-year-old Tecia Harrison, told CNN that she cannot bear to think of her mother's last moments. \"I haven't seen it, and I don't think I have the heart or mind to watch it because that's my mother there,\" Harrison said. \"That's the woman who gave birth to me 31 years ago. I cannot watch that.\" Green was involuntarily admitted to the hospital's psychiatric emergency department June 18 for \"agitation and psychosis.\" Friend Peter Pilgrim says he saw Green a few days before her death. He says she was struggling with losing her job at a day care center and had been forced to move out of her apartment. \"Esmin Green is a beautiful person,\" he said. \"She has a good heart. She loved people, and she loved children.\" Green's pastor says she had been hospitalized with emotional problems once before and recently appeared to be in distress again. So the pastor called 911, a decision that haunts her. Upon her admission, Green waited nearly 24 hours for treatment, said the New York Civil Liberties Union, which released the surveillance video of the incident Tuesday. Her collapse came at 5:32 a.m. June 19, the NYCLU said, and she stopped moving at 6:07 a.m. During that time, according to the organization, workers at the hospital ignored her. At 6:35 a.m., the tape shows a hospital employee approaching and nudging Green with her foot, the group said. Help was summoned three minutes later.  Watch the surveillance video \u00bb . In addition, the organization said, hospital staff falsified Green's records to cover up the time she had lain there without assistance. \"Contrary to what was recorded from four different angles by the hospital's video cameras, the patient's medical records say that at 6 a.m., she got up and went to the bathroom, and at 6:20 a.m. she was 'sitting quietly in waiting room' -- more than 10 minutes since she last moved and 48 minutes after she fell to the floor.\" The medical examiner's office says it is still trying to determine what caused Green's death. Her medical records will be the focus of an investigation. Hospital documents say she was \"awake and sitting quietly\" at the very moment she was actually struggling on the floor. The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, which oversees the hospital, released a statement Tuesday saying it was \"shocked and distressed by this situation. It is clear that some of our employees failed to act based on our compassionate standards of care.\" James Saunders, a spokesman for the corporation, said seven employees have been fired or suspended: the chief of psychiatry, chief of security, a doctor, two nurses and two security guards. A Health and Hospitals Corporation spokeswoman said it was aware of the discrepancies in Green's record when it began the preliminary investigation June 20. The corporation pledged to put \"additional and significant\" reforms in place in the wake of the death. A federal investigation is also under way, looking into abuse allegations at Kings County that were detailed in a lawsuit in 2007. In May 2007, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Mental Hygiene Legal Service sued Kings County in federal court, alleging that conditions at the facility are filthy. Patients are often forced to sleep in plastic chairs or on floors covered in urine, feces and blood while waiting for beds, the groups allege, and often go without basic hygiene such as showers, clean linens and clean clothes. The lawsuit claims that patients who complain face physical abuse and are injected with drugs to keep them docile. The hospital, the suit alleges, lacks \"the minimal requirements of basic cleanliness, space, privacy, and personal hygiene that are constitutionally guaranteed even to convicted felons.\" Among the reforms agreed to in court Tuesday by the hospital are additional staffing; checking of patients every 15 minutes; and limiting to 25 the number of patients in the psychiatric emergency ward, officials said. In addition, the hospital said it is expanding crisis-prevention training for staff; expanding space to prevent overcrowding; and reducing patients' wait time for release, treatment or placement in an inpatient bed."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Esmin Green died in a hospital waiting room, ignored by staff.

After Guy Adams, a British newspaper reporter for The Independent, posted negative comments about NBC's tape-delayed Olympics coverage (including one executive's work e-mail for viewers to make complaints), Twitter alerted its business partner -- NBC -- and showed the network how to file a complaint capable of shutting down the offending user. Both Twitter and NBC apologized Tuesday, and Twitter restored Adams' account. Yes, the Twitterverse should be appalled, but we should not be surprised. First off, Twitter is a private, for-profit company. Having provided a free service to millions of Internet users for years, the company is attempting to placate and even pay back investors who have been awaiting returns on millions of venture dollars. This means becoming more restrictive, more top-down and more corporate. Last month, in an effort to raise advertising revenue, the company announced it was closing its API (application program interface) to third-party apps -- meaning people and companies can no longer make applications that stream Twitter data. This makes it harder to see Tweets from places other than Twitter's own website. It's an entirely less open service this way, but it also gives Twitter exclusive control over how and where people access its content -- and advertisements. And now, as if to prove that it's more of a corporate player than a tool for corporate critique and other radical activity, Twitter has given its biggest partners a primer in how to ban users that offend them: Simply ask us. Tech: Welcome to the Twitter Olympics . So is the Net suddenly less free and open? No. The Net -- at least as a technology -- is just as free as it was before. This is simply what happens when we rely on a highly centralized and privately owned tool for a capability that might best be accomplished through a more distributed technology. The Net might be a big decentralized network, but Twitter is a single, centralized node on that network. Our tweets don't self-replicate and spread; they go to Twitter, which then essentially broadcasts them to our followers. This is an efficient system, for sure, but it is also highly controllable. The extent to which our messages proliferate depends entirely on the kindness of Twitter, a company that has priorities other than us. The alternative would be to sidestep Twitter altogether, and re-create its functionality through less restrictive, distributed tools. We could use the messaging equivalent of Napster or Tor -- the peer-to-peer networks that let people share music and movies with each other. Instead of downloading files from a central server, people get bits and pieces of files from one another. Likewise, e-mail travels sideways from server to server, in bits and pieces, with no truly central administrator motivated to ban a particular user for what he's writing. We may not like Twitter for what it's doing, but it's not up to a multimillion-dollar corporation to act against its own short-term financial interests in favor of freedom of our speech. Tech: Meet the man who started #NBCFail . It is, however, up to those of us who want a free and open Internet to make the effort to understand how our technologies work and who controls them. Only then will we be capable of exploring alternatives to centralized corporate software, and of building and supporting them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Twitter's corporate evolution resulted in Guy Adams' ban and reinstatement.

It also brings out the worst. In the fragmentary accounts that followed Friday's horrifying massacre at a Connecticut school, some news organizations, following in the tracks of social media, managed to identify the wrong man as the shooter. And then television provided a platform for the instantaneous finger-pointing and point-scoring that all too often follows such shootings. I am conflicted when I watch the instant network specials, led by top anchors and featuring theme music and fancy logos, as I did after Columbine, after Virginia Tech, after Tucson, after Aurora. Of course they want to devote time and resources to a major national story. But it also feels at times like a branding exercise, an effort to grab ratings share after a heartbreaking event. I am conflicted as well at watching some journalists interview children who saw the carnage. I understand their value as eyewitnesses, but these are young kids who had just been through a terrible trauma. To me, at least, it feels exploitative. Some organizations, including CNN, require the parents' permission, but it is not clear that all outlets followed such a policy in the scramble that followed the shootings. I was not conflicted at all when I read that a Hartford Courant reporter called the shooter's grandmother in Florida. \"I just don't know, and I can't make a comment right now,\" Dorothy Hanson, 78, said in a shaky voice as she started to cry. I fail to see what that added to our understanding of the tragedy. Watch: Jon Stewart, media critic, takes on Fox . The worst offense, though, was the headlong rush to identify the shooter as Ryan Lanza, 24, and blast his Facebook profile picture around cyberspace. CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, CBS, Slate, the Huffington Post and others named Ryan Lanza as the suspect, some of them based on guidance from law enforcement sources. In this wired age, his name was bandied about on Twitter and in other social media forums. The news outlets had to correct their reports when it turned out that the shooter was 20-year-old Adam Lanza, his brother, who first killed their mother. But they had suggested that an innocent man was responsible for murdering 27 people, including 20 children. What's more, most reports erroneously said Lanza's mother taught at the Newtown elementary school (a mistake I initially repeated as well). Watch: From Joe Scarborough to Rush Limbaugh, the conservative media meltdown . Blogger Jeff Jarvis, who teaches journalism at the City University of New York, expressed regret for retweeting information about Ryan Lanza, although Jarvis did not use his name: \"I did not say this was the 'alleged' or 'reputed' account of the person named as the killer. These are basic, basic journalistic skills drilled until they are reflexes and I would use them in any story for print. I didn't use them online.\" Not everyone was as candid in confessing their mistakes. The rush to judgment is hardly an isolated incident. After an Arizona gunman last year killed six people and wounded Gabby Giffords, some news organizations erroneously reported that the congresswoman was dead. After the Aurora shooting this past summer in a theater showing a Batman movie, ABC's Brian Ross told viewers the suspect was linked to the Colorado tea party before apologizing for reporting on someone with the same name. Watch: Is 'Zero Dark Thirty' tortured history or propaganda? After Friday's violence, there was an instinct by some in the media to pound away at their favorite positions. Mike Huckabee said on Fox News: \"We ask why there is violence in our schools, but we've systematically removed God from our schools.\" I respect the former Arkansas governor, but Friday did not seem like the time for such a statement. At the same time, Rush Limbaugh ripped MSNBC's Alex Wagner and CNN's Piers Morgan for saying the massacre pointed up the need for stricter gun control. \"You've got a horrible event here, and they're already looking to politicize it. ... These people look at stuff like this as an opportunity to advance their agenda or blame conservatives.\" (The three guns, including an assault rifle, used by Adam Lanza were legally registered to his mother.) All this is reminiscent of what happened to NBC's Bob Costas when he used a halftime commentary to question the gun culture in this country after an NFL player was involved in a murder-suicide. Costas was attacked from the right for daring to inject a serious issue into a sporting event. Watch: The media fixate on Hillary and 2016, again . Except in the days following a mass shooting, the media seem to shy away from a serious debate over gun control, perhaps fearing that it is too divisive and will alienate a broad swath of readers and viewers. The mainstream press operates under the assumption that Congress will never pass a gun-control measure because of the NRA's clout and therefore the matter isn't much worth pursuing. The issue was barely mentioned in the presidential campaign, and journalists made no attempt to force it onto the national agenda. The same thing will happen after Newtown inevitably fades from the newscasts and the front pages, and the gun question disappears until the next big tragedy forces us to revisit it once again.

Even the one that isn't human. The Seattle resident scaled the skyscraper's stairway heights on Sunday thanks to what the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago calls the \"world's first neural-controlled bionic leg.\" In other words, when Vawter thinks about going somewhere, it sends a signal to his prosthetic right leg that spurs it to move. This kind of technology has been implemented before in arms and fingers, but never before in a leg. While Vawter, 31, has been part of the Illinois rehab center's trial for about a year, this weekend's fourth annual SkyRise Chicago fundraiser was the first public test of the technology. There was no guarantee he'd successfully climb the entire skyscraper formerly known as the Sears Tower, but he'd certainly give it a shot. Yet there he was -- 53 minutes, 9 seconds after he set off -- in the tower's SkyDeck Chicago, and seemingly on top of the world. 'Bionic blonde' uses triathlon to take control . \"It was a good goal for the team to shoot for, and we hit it,\" he said immediately afterward. This perch was a far cry from where Vawter found himself three years earlier, in a hospital room after his leg was amputated following a motorcycle accident. He'd long been a runner, competing for St. Martin's University in Lacey, Washington, in races like the 800, 3,000 and 5,000 meters as well as in cross-country events. And now, all of a sudden, he was a patient with just one leg. But Vawter took a positive turn when he teamed up with the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, which U.S. News and World Report ranks as the nation's top rehab hospital. He became a willing human guinea pig for researchers testing the one-of-a-kind prosthetic. In an interview with CNN affiliate WLS prior to Sunday's climb, Vawter called the new leg \"a dramatic improvement over my normal prosthetic.\" \"It's something exciting and fun, and I hope that we push the boundaries of what the research and the leg is capable of,\" he said. Levi Hargrove, from the Chicago rehab center, told WLS that \"really advanced hardware\" makes the device work. \"We record all of the data on the computer, and then teach this small microcomputer what it looks like\" as the leg moves, Hargrove adds. Vawter was met with cheers as he entered the skyscraper's front door on Sunday morning, then again after he trekked up the final steps. He had plenty of company and fellow inspiration as he went skyward, as one of about 3,000 people making the climb and raising roughly $1 million for the rehab center. Among them was U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, who has worked tirelessly with the Rehabilitation Institute since suffering a stroke last January. In his first public appearance since then, he climbed 37 flights in about an hour. \"However bad it looks, if you or a loved one has suffered a debilitating stroke, you could be climbing the tower one day with us,\" Kirk said afterward, in comments provided by RIC. \"Don't give up!\" That is Vawter's mindset as well. He's happy to help the cause, and to move forward in his own life with his new prosthetic's help. \"It feels awesome,\" he said of the leg."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Zac Vawter, who lost his leg in a motorcycle accident, climbed Willis Tower using a bionic leg for the SkyRise Chicago fundraiser.

Boys who are new to the team were pinned down by seniors in the locker room, one of whom would anally penetrate them with his finger then stick it in the boys mouth, it was claimed this week. Arrest warrants have been issued for seven members of the team, who play for Sayreville War Memorial High School in New Jersey. And now claims have emerged that seven people at once were required for the sick ritual. Four boys would pin the freshman down in the locker room, and two would stand guard. The seventh would howl, turn off the lights, then carry out the penetration, according to the new claims. 'Sick ritual': Sayreville War Memorial High School's football team, some of whose players are pictured above, has been by a hazing scandal. The identities of the players involved is not known . Sayreville War Memorial High School has been rocked by allegations of bullying, intimidation and harassment among players on their popular football team. Here students are seen arriving at the school this week . Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying' on the football team . The description of the attacks, which are alleged to have taken place almost every day from September 19 to 29, was given by an unnamed parent of a football player to NJ Advance Media on Saturday. He or she described the ritual as 'sickening'. They said: 'Just think if my son or somebody else\u2019s son wanted to leave and they either felt overwhelmed by it, [or] they couldn't leave because there was somebody at the door'. It came as the coach of the team, George Najjar, refused to answer questions to the news website about whether he would resign. He said: 'There will be a time and place when I have something to say, but now is not the time.' All seven of the accused players have been charged with sex crimes. Sayreville War Memorial High School senior Kishan Patel, 17, stops to answer questions from the media as he leaves school Tuesday October 7, 2014, in Sayreville, N.J . A reported hazing incident that 'went too far' and is at the center of the investigation into the high school football team that has resulted in the cancellation of the school's football season. Patel believes when investigation is done, the cancellation of the school's football season will be seen as an overreaction . Three were charged with aggravated sexual assault, criminal restraint, hazing and other crimes for an act of sexual penetration upon one of the children. The four other students were charged with aggravated criminal sexual contact and other crimes. Those in custody were awaiting a Family Court decision on whether they would be held at a juvenile detention facility or be released to their families. Their names weren't released because of their ages. On Monday night, schools Superintendent Richard Labbe announced he was canceling the rest of the season after the prosecutor's office substantiated allegations of hazing involving members of the school's football team. Parents in the township have complained that the whole team is being punished. However, the victims' families insist the gravity of the case warrants the drastic measures. 'In the darkness, a freshman football player would be pinned to the locker-room floor, his arms and feet held down by multiple upperclassmen,' reports\u00a0NJ Advance Media. 'Then, the victim would be lifted to his feet while a finger was forced into his rectum. Sometimes, the same finger was then shoved into the freshman player\u2019s mouth.' One official also told\u00a0ABC News, '[The freshmen] would live in fear of seniors and juniors. They would race to the locker room to get changed and get out before the older kids got there.' This was all uncovered when a parent of one child notified authorities about what was happening at the high school. Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying'. He added that these incidences took place 'on a pervasive level, on a wide scale level and at a level which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted'. 'Based upon that information, we are canceling the remainder of the football season for the freshman, the junior varsity and varsity football programs,' Supt Labbe said. According to CBS New York, Supt Labbe explained that the school first learned of the allegations last week through an anonymous allegation made to the Sayreville Police Department. 'They informed me that upon preliminary investigation, the matter in the incidents that occurred or that were alleged to have occurred, or were of such a serious nature that they were forced to turn the case over immediately to the office of the Middlesex County prosecutor,' he added. No players have been suspended and Supt Labbe would not comment on whether any personnel will be fired. He said canceling the season sends a clear message that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated.\u00a0'This district and this board of education is making a unified stance to say 'no.' No to bullying,' he said. Supt Labbe added that in addition to the criminal investigation, the high school is also investigating to see if similar behavior took place within any other sports. Speaking to CBS New York's radio channel, some parents claimed canceling the football program is not fair to innocent players. 'The students can't play, it's a ding on the entire community, it's a ding on the high school,' one parent whose son is on the team said.

They're being punished for something they did not do,' another parent added. A number of commentators on Twitter seemed to agree . I feel bad for those Sayreville players,' one person wrote. 'I couldn't imagine having something I work so hard for be taken away because of others poor choices.' But others praised Sayreville's zero tolerance approach to bullying. One person wrote: 'I'm so proud the district took a MAJOR stand against bullying.' 'Was the only choice the program had.' another wrote. 'People didn't want to listen and thought the sport should win out. Safety is priority.'

Actor Benicio Del Toro stars in \"Che,\" which details Che Guevara's role in the 1950s Cuban revolution. The movie was screened Saturday in the Yara movie theater in central Havana as part of the 30th International Festival of the New Latin American Cinema. \"Che\" also played Sunday at Havana's Karl Marx Theater. \"Che\" stars Oscar winner Benicio Del Toro in the title role, for which he won a best actor award at this year's Cannes Film Festival. But it's one thing to make a movie about Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara and the Cuban revolution and show it in France, quite another to screen it in Cuba. Speaking to CNN outside the Karl Marx Theater, the bilingual Puerto Rican actor admitted some anxiety. \"This is Cuban history, so there's an audience in there that probably, that could be the biggest critics and the most knowledgeable critics of the historical accuracy of the film,\" Del Toro said.  Watch Del Toro talk about the movie in Cuba \u00bb . It appears he needn't have worried. Audiences gave the movie hearty ovations. And Granma, the official mouthpiece of the Cuban government, gave Del Toro a glowing review. \"Del Toro personifies Che in a spectacular manner, not only his physical appearance but also his masterly interpretation,\" the state newspaper said. After the showing, Del Toro characterized the public reaction as \"sensational, a shot of adrenaline,\" Granma said. \"The dream was to make this movie and to bring it here, where it all began.\" The movie has two parts: \"El argentino,\" which portrays Guevara's role in the 1950s Cuban revolution, and \"Guerrilla,\" which shows Guevara's efforts in Africa and Bolivia, where he was killed in 1967. It was directed by Steven Soderbergh, who also directed Del Toro in the 2000 film \"Traffic,\" for which Del Toro won an Oscar. At 4 hours and 17 minutes, \"Che\" can test viewers' stamina. But that wasn't a problem in Havana. It's a story Cubans know by heart. But this time, it's told by outsiders. Catalina, a history professor who would give only her first name, was a tough critic. \"The movie is well-done. It has good intentions,\" she said. \"But in my opinion, in the first part, the scenes in the jungle seemed a bit like a caricature.\" Though some debated the details of this story they know so well, most -- like a young Guevara lookalike who identified himself only as Daniel -- were pleased. \"It has captured history to perfection,\" he said. \"It has been well thought out and well-created.\" Others, like student Susel Paraza, were torn about seeing their history told by others. \"What hurt me a little,\" she said, \"is that it wasn't us, the Cubans, who thought to make a movie like this but instead a foreign director with foreign actors who have recreated this story very well.\" Other foreign actors have played Guevara, most notably Egyptian-born Omar Sharif in a 1969 U.S. production titled \"Che!\" Soderbergh's \"Che\" has been shown at six film festivals worldwide and will have a limited opening in the United States on December 12. It is scheduled for widespread U.S. distribution starting January 24. Although many may not know Guevara's history, his image is recognized worldwide from a photograph taken by Alberto Korda at a Havana memorial service in March 1960. Titled \"Guerrillero Heroico\" (Heroic Guerrilla), the image of a somber, long-haired and bearded Guevara wearing a beret with a lone star became what the Maryland Institute College of Art called \"the most famous photograph in the world and a symbol of the 20th century.\" The image has been emblazoned on everything from T-shirts to posters and even tattoos. \"There is no other image like it. What other image has been sustained in this way?\" Trisha Ziff, the curator of an exhibition on the iconography of Guevara, asked in a 2007 interview with the BBC. \"Che Guevara has become a brand. And the brand's logo is the image, which represents change. It has becomes the icon of the outside thinker, at whatever level -- whether it is anti-war, pro-green or anti-globalization.\" Guevara was 31 years old when the photo was taken. He has been dead for 41 years, longer than he was alive. Jonathan Green, former longtime director of the UCR/California Museum of Photography, has been quoted as saying, \"Korda's image has worked its way into languages around the world. It has become an alpha-numeric symbol, a hieroglyph, an instant symbol. It mysteriously reappears whenever there's a conflict.

The smell of bacon cooking can really get your taste buds going but a bridal store in the Wintergarden shopping centre in Brisbane, Queensland has complained about the fatty aroma coming through the air conditioning vents from the nearby Gramercy Coffee cafe. After cooking bacon since January last year, cafe owner Mitch Suchowacki received a letter from the centre's management last month pointing out that his lease did not allow him to cook items that required an extraction fan. Mitch\u00a0Suchowacki has been banned from using bacon at his cafe and now uses jamon instead . Mr Suchowacki said he had been approached by management earlier in the year about the quantity of bacon being cooked.

Staying power: Jack Wilshere is one of only two players who started the last game against the Swiss in 2011 . Between 1880 and 1927, England played Wales alone 33 times on a Monday, which may have influenced statistics that sees them having won 37 of 55 games played while drawing 11 and losing seven. England's game on Monday is a consequence of UEFA spreading out qualification matches as part of their new 'Week of Football' concept, with games taking place from Thursday to Tuesday. That means that 33 per cent of games now take place at weekends as opposed to just 10 per ent during 2012 qualifying. The final set of fixtures in each group, scheduled for October 2015 - will still kick-off simultaneously. Meanwhile, here are all the other facts and figures on games between Switzerland and England ahead of a meeting that will help determine where we finish in our group... Sick note: England will be without Daniel Sturridge after the striker picked up a knock in training . Spot on: Wayne Rooney celebrates after scoring a penalty in the international friendly against Norway . 63.6% - England\u2019s win percentage against Switzerland. They have won 14 of their 22 contests, drawing five and losing just three. They are also unbeaten in their last eight games against the Swiss. 1 - Good news for Roy Hodgson \u2014 England have lost just one of their last 13 international matches away from home. 192 - Some bad news for Hodgson. In 192 minutes of football, England have only managed three shots on target with their one goal coming from the penalty spot. 3 - Wayne Rooney looks a good bet to score at any time. The England captain has scored in each of his three appearances against Switzerland. 2 - Only two players have survived from England\u2019s last game against the Swiss \u2014 Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere both started that match at Wembley in 2011. 17 - England like playing in Basel. They have won four out of five games in the city and scored 17 goals at an average of 3.4 per game. That includes an 8-1 victory in 1963. 9 - Switzerland have not lost at home for nine matches. Their last defeat on home soil came against Romania in May 2012.

If you thought Mars was the best place in the solar system to find signs of life, you might need to think again. The largest moon in our solar system, a companion to Jupiter named Ganymede, might have ice and oceans stacked up in several layers like a club sandwich. And the Nasa-funded research suggests that this may have once been a suitable environment for primitive life. Scroll down for animation . Steve Vance and his team showed that ice and water under the surface has different densities. At the top is the lightest 'Ice I' that is similar to ice cubes in your drink, ranging to the heaviest and densest 'Ice VI' that would sink to the bottom of the sea . Previously, . the moon was thought to harbour a thick ocean sandwiched between just . two layers of ice, one on top and one on bottom, but now it seems it has . multiple layers. The study, led by Steve Vance of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, provides new theoretical evidence for the team's \u2018club sandwich\u2019 model, first proposed last year. The Nasa-funded research modelling the moon's makeup supports idea that primitive life might have possibly arisen on the icy moon. Scientists say that places where water and rock interact are important for the development of life . For example, it's possible life began on Earth in bubbling vents on our sea floor. Prior to the new study, Ganymede's rocky sea bottom was thought to be coated with ice, not liquid - a problem for the emergence of life. The 'club sandwich' findings suggest otherwise: the first layer on top of the rocky core might be salty water. 'This is good news for Ganymede,' said Vance. 'Its ocean is huge, with enormous pressures, so it was thought that dense ice had to form at the bottom of the ocean. 'When we added salts to our models, we came up with liquids dense enough to sink to the sea floor.' Ganymede is one of Jupiter's four largest satellites known as the Galilean moons. From left to right in this artist's mosaic they are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. They are pictured above the Great Red Spot, a storm on Jupiter that has been raging for over 400 years . Nasa scientists first suspected an ocean in Ganymede in the 1970s, based on models of the large moon, which is bigger than Mercury. In the 1990s, Nasa's Galileo mission flew by Ganymede, confirming the moon's ocean, and showing it extends to depths of hundreds of miles. The spacecraft also found evidence for salty seas, likely containing the salt magnesium sulfate. Previous models of Ganymede's oceans assumed that salt didn't change the properties of liquid very much with pressure. Ganymede is one of five moons in our solar system thought to support vast oceans beneath icy crusts. The other moons are Jupiter's Europa and Callisto and Saturn's Titan and Enceladus. The . European Space Agency (Esa) is developing a space mission, called . Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (Juice), pictured above, to visit Europa, . Callisto and Ganymede in the . 2030s. Nasa and JPL are contributing to three instruments on the mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2022. The lightest ice is on top, and the saltiest liquid is heavy enough to sink to the bottom. What's more, the results demonstrate a possible bizarre phenomenon that causes the oceans to 'snow upwards.' As the . oceans churn and cold plumes snake around, ice in the uppermost ocean . layer, called 'Ice III,' could form in the seawater. When . ice forms, salts precipitate out. The heavier salts would fall . downwards, and the lighter ice, or 'snow,' would float upwards. This 'snow' melts again before reaching the top of the ocean, possibly leaving slush in the middle of the moon sandwich. Sotin and Vance are both members of . the Icy Worlds team at JPL, part of the multi-institutional Nasa . Astrobiology Institute based at the Ames Research Center in Moffett . Field, California. The results can be applied to exoplanets too, planets that circle stars beyond our sun. Some super-Earths, rocky planets more massive than Earth, have been proposed as 'water worlds' covered in oceans. Vance . and his team think laboratory experiments and more detailed modeling of . exotic oceans might help find answers as to whether they could have . life. Jupiter's Ganymede, artist's illustration of the interior pictured, is the largest moon in the solar system. Although it was previously thought to have an underground ocean, new research from Nasa suggests it may actually have layers of ice of different density surrounding its subsurface seas that may have hosted life . It may . seem strange that salt can make the ocean denser, but you can see for . yourself how this works by adding plain old table salt to a glass of . water. Rather than increasing in volume, the liquid shrinks and becomes denser. This is because the salt ions attract water molecules. The models get more complicated when the different forms of ice are taken into account. The ice that floats in your drinks is called 'Ice I.' It's the least dense form of ice and lighter than water. But at high pressures, like those in crushingly deep oceans like Ganymede's, the ice crystal structures become more compact. 'It's . like finding a better arrangement of shoes in your luggage - the ice . molecules become packed together more tightly,' said Vance. The . ice can become so dense that it is heavier than water and falls to the . bottom of the sea. The densest and heaviest ice thought to persist in . Ganymede is called 'Ice VI.' By . modeling these processes using computers, the team came up with an . ocean sandwiched between up to three ice layers, in addition to the . rocky seafloor."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NASA's study suggests life potential on Ganymede, Jupiter's moon, and possibly on exoplanets.

Kimberly Ann Crain, who taught third grade in McLoud Public Schools, faces 23 criminal counts, including manufacturing and possessing juvenile pornography, distribution of juvenile pornography and lewd molestation, according to a Thursday filing in Pottawatomie County district court. The alleged recipient of the photos and videotapes -- sent via e-mail and Skype -- was identified as Gary Joseph Doby. Students allegedly knew him as \"Uncle G,\" according to authorities. The retired Bloomsburg University professor also has been arrested, according to Oklahoma City FBI special agent Clay Simmonds. Doby, 65, faces eights counts of manufacturing juvenile pornography and one count of conspiracy to manufacture it. Doby's location following his arrest could not be confirmed Thursday night, nor could it be determined whether he was being represented by an attorney. CNN's attempts to reach Crain's attorney Thursday night were unsuccessful. According to the complaint, Crain, 48, took photos of the girls in a classroom and at a pizza party at her home. After a search of Crain's home, police confiscated computers and numerous documents and asked for FBI assistance, Simmonds said. Crain was arrested on December 1. The FBI found information on the woman's Skype account that led them to Doby, Simmonds said. A search Thursday of Doby's home yielded a computer \"among other questionable items,\" the FBI said. As he was being led away from his arraignment and extradition hearing, Doby told a reporter for CNN affiliate WNEP in Scranton, Pennsylvania, \"Be kind and considerate to my family, because they're going to need it and they didn't have anything to do with this. They need prayers and it's me, not them.\" Crain is accused of taking photos or videos of girls, in many cases with either their breasts or genitals exposed. A concerned Shawnee, Oklahoma, parent contacted police in mid-November after she became aware of contact the teacher had with students at her home, Simmonds said. Crain had invited the students to her home for a pizza party, according to a Shawnee police probable cause affidavit. A parent said her daughter told her that Crain took photos of the girls, dressed in bras and panties she provided, while decorating a Christmas tree, the affidavit states. The underwear had Christmas themes with words like \"Ho! Ho!\" on them, the affidavit states. According to witnesses cited in the affidavit, Crain also would hold up a sheet in the corner of the classroom and have the girls strip down to their bras and panties. The teacher allegedly took photos of the girls, telling them \"Uncle G\" is going to want to see these pictures.\" The affidavit states the FBI found numerous sexual chats between Crain and Doby on Crain's personal laptop computer. An FBI agent said that in some chats, Doby identified some of the students by name and described how \"he liked the features of their private parts and indicated that he wanted to see them nude. Within the recovered chats, Doby instructed Crain to get the girls to cooperate.\" Another parent said she learned from her daughter that a hidden camera or video camera in Crain's home captured images of the girls changing into T-shirts and panties. McLoud Public Schools said it is cooperating with law enforcement agencies. \"As you now know, the Pottawatomie County District Attorney's office was in the midst of conducting an intense and in-depth investigation; therefore, we complied with its request to not release any information which would in any way jeopardize the investigation, and ultimately, an additional arrest,\" the schools said in a statement.

The blushing bride showed off her growing baby bump in a conservative white \u2018mullet\u2019 dress paired with a matching shawl. To complete her wedding day look, Figueroa wore a flower in her hair. Van der Sloot met and fell in love with Figueroa while she was selling goods inside the prison, according to his attorney. Speaking to reporters outside the prison, Altez showed an oil painting given to him by Van der Sloot depicting a tall, solitary woman in a red dress on a palm-studded beach under a radiant sun. The attorney, who acted as a witness during the ceremony, was one of only four people in attendance, among them another lawyer and the bride\u2019s mother. Van der Sloot was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba. No charges were filed against Van der Sloot.

The 57-year-old inmate has spent more than 30 years in prison for the 1980 killing of New York City police officer Joseph Keegan. On Saturday, Lorick will appear before a Manhattan parole board for the fifth time and make a case for his release.

While awaiting the hearing, the lovelorn Clinton Correctional Facility inmate has joined the dating website meet-an-inmate.com hoping to find women 'for friendship or possibly more,' according to his post, which first caught the attention of the New York Daily News. In his profile, the cold-blooded cop killer describes himself in glowing terms as a 'Black male who is childless, single, humorous, witty, loyal, a good listener, and an excellent lover.' On paper, Lorick is quite the catch: a brown-eyed, 5-foot-10, 180-lbs college-educated military veteran from a Protestant background whose many interests include books, music, art, movies, horses, 'and mostly anything involving a woman.' And based on his dating profile, Lorick is not the least bit picky when it comes to choosing a mate. \u2018Your race, weight, and looks are not important to me because all women have something special about them, plus I am looking for love instead of trying to find faults in you,\u2019 he writes. \u2018I have no hidden identities, so you can be yourself without fear or shame, as I have learned that people are not perfect, just human beings.\u2019 The post is accompanied by a photo of Lorick sitting on a bench in a green prison jumpsuit with a 'come hither' look in his eyes. While Lorick seems to be very confident that Friday's hearing will go his way, the victim\u2019s family have vowed to do everything in their power to keep the convicted killer behind bars for the rest of his life.

When Keegan went to arrest Lorick, a struggle ensued and the suspect grabbed the officer's service weapon and shot him in the head. Keegan was just 44 days from an early retirement. He had been planning to quit the force after 15 years so he could start a family. A year later, Lorick was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. He became eligible for parole in 2005, but every time he made a plea for freedom, his request was denied. Last month, 40 of Keegan's family members showed up at the state parole office in Manhattan and handed in their impact statements asking to keep Bruce Lorick incarcerated. \u2018My uncle was executed,\u2019 Noreen Keegan Connelly, the officer\u2019s niece, told the New York Post last month.

Keegan's relatives, among them more than a dozen cops, were infuriated by his killer\u2019s audacity. His niece was also outraged when Keegan offered her a sum of money last year in exchange for her willingness to drop her opposition to his parole bid. \u2018Of course I declined because there\u2019s no dollar value on my uncle\u2019s life or anyone\u2019s life.

We may be living in dumbed-down Britain, but it would appear that, on the whole, we\u2019re rather more cultured than some of our neighbours in Europe. We attend more operas than the Italians and visit more art galleries than the French, according to a study. The report says Britons are ahead of our neighbours on nine key cultural measures \u2013 debunking Europe\u2019s view of us as a race addicted to reality TV and celebrity gossip. The report found Britons were more likely to visit art galleries than the French who claim to have the world's best collections . According to the Brussels-based Eurobarometer survey of 27,000 people from across the EU, we are far more likely to read a book, far more aware of history and far more keen to enjoy cultural events such as the ballet and the theatre than the average EU citizen. The land that gave the world Shakespeare has one of the largest theatre-going publics in Europe, with 39 per cent of Britons saying they had attended a play in the last 12 months \u2013 well above the EU average of 28 per cent. Almost two thirds \u2013 65 per cent \u2013 of us have visited a historical monument or site over the last year. That compares with 54 per cent of French and 41 per cent of Italians. France has long prided itself as nation with the best art galleries. But only 37 per cent of French said they had visited a museum or gallery in the past year, compared to 52 per cent of Britons. You are more likely to find more empty auditorium seats in the home of opera, Italy, where only 17 per cent of natives said they had seen been to one in the last year compared to 22 per cent of Britons. We are also more likely to visit our opera houses such as the Royal Opera House in London (pictured) than Italians, while 80 per cent of us read a book last year . In austerity blighted Greece, visits to . historical monuments have collapsed to under half the EU average, with . domestic visitor numbers at such iconic sites as the Parthenon and .

That compares with the EU average of 68 per cent \u2013 but only just beats the Germans on 79 per cent. With both countries on the verge of political and economic collapse, only half the populations in Greece and Portugal have picked up a book over the last year. Overall, the survey shows that Britain bucks the European-wide decline in arts and literature \u2018involvement\u2019, which is down 24 per cent across the EU over the last five years due to the Eurozone crisis.

What made this recitation of deadly details different from the ones that preceded it during reputed mob boss Bulger's trial in federal court was that the victim had been the girlfriend of the witness. \"It's affected me and it's going to affect me until the day I die,\" Stephen \"The Rifleman\" Flemmi said in the first humanizing testimony the jury had heard in two days of recollections about multiple murders and extortions. Flemmi was Bulger's number-two front man for nearly two decades, when prosecutors say Bulger reigned terror over Boston. Bulger is charged with 19 killings in a 32-count indictment that includes extortion, money laundering, and racketeering in addition to the deaths. \"He strangled her all the way down to the basement...when he got to the basement she was dead,\" Flemmi told the jury, referring to Bulger and Flemmi's girlfriend, Debra Davis. A female juror covered her mouth and began shaking, wiping away tears while she repeatedly checked the time, as if longing for the testimony to end. Shot-by-shot testimony in Bulger trial makes jurors squirm . Prosecutors brought up the horrific murder of Davis in 1981 just 10 minutes before court ended Friday. In his testimony, Flemmi said his much younger girlfriend became very upset when he left her birthday party abruptly to meet with Bulger. Flemmi said he \"inadvertently blurted out\" to Davis that he and Bulger were FBI informants. \"I bit my tongue and said we have a connection to John Connolly in the FBI and I got to leave,\" Flemmi said, referring to his and Bulger's rogue FBI informant-handler. Connolly is serving a 40 year sentence in Florida on murder charges connected to information he leaked to Bulger. Bulger then said several times that \"he wanted to kill her\" because of what Davis then knew about the duo's relationship with Connolly, Flemmi testified. \"I said no, of course not,\" Flemmi continued. \"And he (Bulger) explained a whole litany of reasons why John Connolly helped us... all of us and (said) 'You are jeopardizing that.'\" Flemmi, who testified earlier that Connolly had tipped them off to indictments, wire taps, and investigations, said it took him a while to come around but he eventually agreed to the slaying of Davis. \"I couldn't do it...(Bulger) knew it ... he said, 'I'll take care of it, I'll do it,'\" Flemmi told the jurors as they listened intently. Flemmi invited Davis to a house he had just bought for his parents, and when they walked in the front door, \"He (Bulger) grabbed her by the throat and strangled her,\" Flemmi said. Prosecting attornery Fred Wyshak asked: \"What did you do?\" Flemmi: \"Nothing.\" Wyshak: \"Why not?\" Flemmi: \"That was the plan.\" At that moment in court, Bulger -- whose attorneys made it very clear in opening statements that he does not want the death of women on his hands -- stared at his former partner for the first time all day. It was only for a few seconds before he turned his head back downward. The two, who sparred with expletives at the end of court Thursday, virtually ignored each other Friday except for that one interlude. \"I wrapped her up and he (Bulger) went back upstairs\" Flemmi went on. Flemmi testified that he \"cleaned up\" and they proceeded to take Davis' body to an area near the Neponset river where they buried her in a shallow grave. The remains of Debra Davis were excavated from a tidal marsh in late 2000. Most of her remains were discovered in plastic bags along with rope around the bags, a Massachusetts state forensic anthropologist testified last week. Almost all of Davis' bones were recovered, according to Dr. Ann Marie Mires. Because her body was in bags, even some of her hair was preserved. The hair, along with pieces of bones, were tested for DNA and were positively identified as the remains of Davis, according to Mires. Bulger trial opens window on mob world of cold violence, fierce loyalty . Davis' brother, Steve Davis, has been a regular at trial since it began in June. He told reporters after court, \"I've heard it before. It brings tears to my eyes but I learned how to deal and fight it, because I need to learn more about it, 'cause you don't know all it yet.\" Flemmi pleaded guilty to 10 murders after charges were brought in 2004 and was spared the death penalty after agreeing to testify against Bulger. Of his relationship with Davis, he told the jury: \"I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her.\" After court, the attorneys discussed the defense's amended witness list which had been reduced to 30 on Tuesday, from originally over 80 witnesses. Prosecuting attorney Brian Kelly argued that at least 15 of the witnesses -- former FBI agents -- would be a \"waste\" of the jury's time, as they are being called to refute the notion that Bulger was an informant, something Bulger has strongly denied. Kelly called these witnesses \"irrelevant.\" Defense attorney Hank Brennan responded: \"Our witnesses are now down to 30. They are relevant to our case and we intend to call them.\" The defense had mentioned on Tuesday that it would shrink its list if alleged extortion victim Stephen Rakes didn't testify because several defense witnesses were intended to challenge Rakes' expected testimony. Rakes learned Tuesday that prosecutors no longer planned to call him to the stand, according to a friend of Rakes. On Wednesday, Rakes' body was discovered near a walking trail about 30 miles from his home. CNN affiliate WBZ reported that his car was found Friday about six miles from where his remains were found. Federal law enforcement authorities were \"shocked\" to learn about the unexplained death of Rakes, according to a source familiar with the investigation into Rakes' death. Authorities consider Rakes' death suspicious, the source added, and authorities hope that there is no connection to the ongoing Bulger trial. The death is under investigation.

It was horribly personal towards Arsene Wenger and I have huge sympathy with the Gunners manager for the abuse he had to suffer in those circumstances after the 3-2 defeat. But it did the job Wenger seems incapable of. It got the players playing for him, and it even got the Emirates crowd singing his name after Saturday\u2019s win over Newcastle. Arsene Wenger looks dejected after Arsenal lost to Stoke earlier this month . Of course, Arsenal have a habit of smashing inferior opponents and then failing badly when it matters, so let\u2019s see how the revival against Galatasaray and then Newcastle works out going forward. And what a stroke of good fortune when the Gunners picked out Monaco in the Champions League draw. If they don\u2019t get through that Wenger should resign on the spot and hang his head in shame. But against a backdrop of embarrassing defending, lack of leadership, strange tactics, fans arguing and even fighting among themselves, and a manager being abused by the club\u2019s own supporters, one player has stood out with his quality, his attitude and his demeanour. I\u2019ve seen Arsenal several times this season and on each occasion the Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has played well, I\u2019ve never seen his shoulders slump when things were going wrong, I\u2019ve never seen him abandon the sinking ship. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been one of Arsenal's star performers this season . Oxlade-Chamberlain never lets his head drop when playing for Arsenal . What I love about the way he plays is that he is so dynamic: every time he gets the ball I sense that something exciting is going to happen. And he\u2019s not a one-trick Ox either. He can run with the ball, he can spot and execute a pass \u2013 and a killer pass to - he can cross, and he can finish. He played the full 90 minutes in Turkey and then produced a man-of-the-match performance against Newcastle. In the Premier League or the Champions League the Ox has proved he can play in different positions and still produce quality. And he can change a game \u2013 I was in Rio in 2013 when he came on as sub and transformed England from a side being overrun by Brazil, to a team dominating the game. He also scored a wondergoal in the Maracana that day. Oxlade-Chamberlain seems to have the ability to perform at whatever level and on whatever stage you ask him and it was England\u2019s misfortune he was injured for the World Cup \u2013 I believe he could have made a difference. So did Roy Hodgson, that\u2019s why he took the gamble and took the Ox to Brazil in the summer. Sadly it didn\u2019t work out. Oxlade-Chamberlain scored an excellent goal for England in the Maracana against Brazil last year . In my view he should be playing regularly for Arsenal \u2013 he\u2019s been in and out of the line-up this season but has started the last four games \u2013 and should be a permanent fixture for England. He rarely has a bad game, is usually a threat and so far in his career he has conducted himself impeccably. Future captaincy material? I\u2019d say so. One final thought on Arsenal\u2019s win over Newcastle: a decent display from Santi Cazorla, and some have given him credit for staying on his feet in the box instead of going down screaming for a penalty. But what I didn\u2019t like from Cazorla was the dinked penalty at the end. Some call it cheeky, I call it disrespectful and unprofessional. Santi Cazorla chips the ball over Newcastle keeper Jak Alnwick to score his penalty . Cazorla should have shown more respect when taking his penalty . Jak Alnwick is a rookie keeper, Newcastle United\u2019s third choice, on his full debut he\u2019s already had to pick the ball out of the net three times, and knows he\u2019s likely to have to do it again as he sets himself for Cazorla\u2019s penalty. I\u2019ve no problem with the Spaniard scoring the penalty \u2013 of course not. But why is he so keen to humiliate and embarrass a young fellow professional? It lacked class and there was simply no need for it. Cazorla could learn from the Germans who chose to take their foot off the gas against Brazil in the World Cup semi-final \u2013 that could have been double figures easily. The Spaniard is a good player \u2013 he doesn\u2019t need to resort to such nonsense."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Arsenal's performance improved after a defeat to Stoke and a motivational speech from fans, leading to victories against Galatasaray and Newcastle.

Save the Children CEO Carolyn Miles recently returned from a visit to the refugee camps in Iraq where she saw the conditions firsthand. (Save The Children) -- Tiny baby Banaz sat sleeping peacefully in her car seat, unaware of the hubbub around her. Her beautiful 2-month-old face was the picture of calm. We sat on an old mattress in the heat and spoke with her parents, who had left Syria just one month before. They fled the violence and instability in the province of Hasakah in northern Syria to come to this teeming, garbage strewn spot near the northern Iraqi mountains. Her young father spoke of the day they decided to leave Syria, when the fighting got to be too much. The family of four -- mother, father, 2-year-old Zahraa and 1-month-old Banaz -- left with nothing but what they could carry on the walk to Domiz camp. Banaz and her family may be some of the lucky ones to get to the relative safety of this northern region of Iraq. The border at the crossing they came through was closed during our visit, with thousands of Syrian refugees, many of them Kurdish, now waiting along the border. They are escaping the fighting that has torn Syria apart and scattered its people. The border points for refugees trying to leave Syria can close unpredictably --just one more piece of uncertainty for a people brutalized by a war that has killed at least 70,000 and driven more than 1.7 million from Syria to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and here in Iraq. These refugees may be the most forgotten of this war, with the majority of the attention and funding for relief going to the large populations now living in Jordan and Lebanon. But Iraq now has more than 161,000 refugees -- most of them in northern Iraq -- and by UNHCR estimates that figure could reach a staggering 350,000 by the end of this year. The Kurdistan Regional Government, which leads three northern provinces of Iraq, has stepped up to try to help those flowing across the Syrian border, providing basic housing and services like meals and water. But the flow is becoming too much, with a camp developed last April for 10,000 now swelling to more than 50,00, with absolutely no capacity to receive any more of those expected to surge in again once the border reopens. The conditions in the camp are tough. More than 50,000 people are packed in a dense area outside the city of Duhok with no sewer systems, insufficient everything, and the threat of screaming wind storms, like the one that tore apart tents the day before our arrival. The smell and the heat -- 90 F when we were there, certain to be 110 or more by August -- follow you everywhere and trash is piled high along parts of the rutted dirt and mud pathways. Banaz's parents were doing the best they could, staying in the tent with a neighbor from their old village while they waited for a tent of their own and searched for work in the nearby village. The father was a roofer by trade and was trying to find a position that would allow him to get his family out of the camp to a better life. When asked if he would go back to Syria, he said of course it was his country and he loved it and would go back -- as soon as it was safe. As we finished our visit, Banaz's eyes fluttered open and she blinked awake. This little baby is clearly cherished in the midst of the squalor and hardship that is now her family's life. She and her parents and sister should not be forgotten in Iraq. It is an urgent and rapidly growing need, and we must all step up and help in a country that now faces yet another major challenge after years of war.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\n(CNN) -- Thirty minutes into the movie \"Miami Connection\" the audience sees a classic '80s montage scene, except there's something a bit off. The film's heroes, a group of five University of Central Florida students who are martial-arts experts (and orphans), hit up the beach for some much needed fun in the sun. (They're in a band called Dragon Sound, which serves as a vehicle for their tae kwon do-inspired songs). As the band members drive along the shore, they catcall out to women with painful lines such as \"they don't make buns like those down at the bakery,\" trying to pick them up using phony French accents. The dialogue hardly matches up with the characters' mouth movements, and the scene ends with two characters making out in the tide, waves crashing down around them. In the context of the film, nothing about this scene really drives the plot, furthers the character development or makes much sense at all. Which is exactly why some fans consider it great. But the term \"great\" is relative. Originally made in 1987, \"Miami Connection\" was rediscovered in June 2009 when Zack Carlson, a programmer at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin, Texas, came across it on eBay and made a blind bid on it. He won it for a mere $50, having no idea he was the first step in the film's unlikely comeback. \"We played a reel in the (Alamo Drafthouse), and the few people that were in the theater went bananas,\" Carlson said. \"We instantly scheduled the movie to play during our weekly exploitation series.\" Though it's not always easy to figure out what exactly is going on in \"Miami Connection,\" the story follows members of Dragon Sound as they find themselves mixed up with a group of ninjas linked to the bubbling cocaine trade out of Miami. It stars Grandmaster Y.K. Kim, a central Florida martial-arts expert, who was pitched the idea of a feature-length film after director Richard Park saw him in the mid-'80s on the South Korean talk show \"Meet at 11 p.m.\" Most of the actors and crew were Kim's tae kwon do students. With the assistance of funding from Kim and some investors, \"Miami Connection\" was filmed in Orlando and Miami. Kim said he had high hopes that his creative work would find a distributor and explode onto the national scene. \"When I finished the movie, I showed this to hundreds of different studios and distribution companies,\" Kim said. \"They all said, 'This is trash. Don't waste your time.' \" Still, Kim pressed on. The film opened in September 1988, limited to eight theaters in the Orlando area. He continued trying to get major distributors for a national release and even tried to rally Hollywood bigwigs at the prestigious Cannes Film Festival. But the film bombed, and Kim saw his endeavor slip into obscurity (along with the roughly $1 million it cost to make). When Carlson got a hold of it, enough time had passed so that it was received as something wholly different. He screened it around Austin and noticed a huge, positive response. Moviegoers ate up the bad dialogue, laughed at the bad special effects and staged ninja fights, and reveled in a heavy dose of '80s cheese. Carlson pushed the film to Evan Husney, creative director for the Alamo Drafthouse's distribution arm, Drafthouse Films. In December, Husney called Kim and told him he wanted to rerelease the movie. Thinking it was some sort of cruel joke, Kim hung up several times. Husney courted him for months before the deal to resurrect \"Miami Connection\" was made. Now, decades later, thanks in part to the current love of irony and an enduring fascination with all things '80s, the film is enjoying an impressive victory lap. It screened at the New York Asian Film Festival in July and Los Angeles' Everything Is Festival in August, where the reaction was largely the same as Carlson witnessed when he first discovered it. \"What I'd like to think is that people really get enthusiastic about the sincerity in the movie,\" Carlson said. \"They initially get pulled in by the irony, the '80s fashion, but what's underneath it is very entertaining. People respond to many different things, but they start to like the characters.\" \"Miami Connection\" is seeing the national rollout in theaters that Kim had always hoped would happen. DVDs, Blu-rays and soundtracks are available -- even vinyl singles for those wanting to keep things fittingly retro. Kim is going to a handful of showings and providing a martial-arts demonstration for moviegoers. The experience has taught Carlson that \"bad movies that people respond to aren't actually bad.\" \"There's a sincerity within them that people latch onto,\" he said. \"There's not a lot of technique or talent behind 'Miami Connection.' But there's so much initiative and dedication behind it, even if they failed at what they were trying to do. They were really into it and really trying. That's why people are responding to it now.\" \"Miami Connection\" opens November 9 in Los Angeles and New York, with a nationwide release in other cities scheduled through December."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Zack Carlson rediscovered 'Miami Connection', a 1987 film featuring the band Dragon Sound and starring Grandmaster Y.K.

The story will leave the headlines at the end of this week but on Monday hundreds of thousands of workers will return to factories that are frankly further tragedies waiting to happen, and will keep producing clothes for high street brands. Seven hundred workers have died in factory collapses and fires in this very small region outside Dhaka alone in the last decade. Savar, where the building collapse took place, is a swampland (yes, swampland...) north of the Bangladeshi capital which has seen mass growth in recent years. This same region was the site of a horrific factory fire in November last year, when 112 workers burned alive in a building with no fire exits. Hundreds of factories are being thrown up in a short space of time, with limited building regulations, to meet the growing demand from western brands for cheap export clothing. And it is cheap. Wages for Bangladeshi workers are the lowest in Asia, aside from the recently opened Myanmar industry, at $37 a month. Read more: At least 250 killed in fire at Bangladeshi clothing factory . As the demand for cheap clothing grows in the west, brands continue to look for ways to race to the bottom on prices, and sadly this involves cutting corners on health and safety. Brands will by no means admit to this. The prices that they pay, they assure us, are enough to pay workers enough to live on and keep factories in tip top condition. But, faced with constantly decreasing incomes, factory owners inevitably let things slide, like replacing faulty machinery or fixing worrying building subsidence... When garment factories were still mainly based in retail countries, consumers knew people who held jobs in factories, and had a personal connection with those who had been injured or put at risk in the workplace. But with globalization has come consumer apathy. Who cares about people who make clothing? As long as it is cheap we will buy it. Especially in a recession, cheap clothing is a welcome industry for many. People in western countries living on the poverty line need to buy clothes for their children. Jobs in Bangladesh are also vital for a country where hundreds of thousands of people live below the poverty line. It isn't the responsibility of the consumer to feel guilty about buying what is readily available in shops. Business must stop just holding up its hands to say: \"It is not our fault -- they bought it.\" The responsibility for ensuring that a product was made with human rights in mind has to fall somewhere, and the United Nations guiding principles on business and human rights says that it falls jointly to states and mass corporate businesses to \"protect, respect and remedy\" human rights. In short, the brands, not the consumer, are the ones who must take responsibility for the endemic problems that this industry faces. Read more: Is your old -shirt making Africa poor? So what can be done? Many western brands rely on audits and in-house checks to monitor whether conditions in their factories are up to scratch. In a country where a little hand shake and a small exchange of money gets the job done, this process often fails to give an accurate picture of factory conditions, building and fire safety. It is common for fire extinguishers to be borrowed for inspection day, for workers to be schooled in what answers they have to give when asked questions. The Clean Clothes Campaign together with local and global unions and labor rights organizations, has developed a program that hopes to solve this. The Bangladesh Building and Fire Safety Agreement is a proposal for a sector-wide initiative that includes independent building inspections, worker rights training, public disclosure and a long-overdue review of safety standards. The crucial element of this is that unions and worker led committees take a central role in monitoring and reporting back on improvements that need to be made, in a public way. This transparent and practical agreement is unique in that it is supported by all key labor stakeholders in Bangladesh and internationally. So far, U.S. company PVH, owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, and German retailer Tchibo have signed up to the program, but it needs a critical mass of brand support to be implemented.

But this morning, four of  BBC News Online's seven articles on the report made no reference to Pakistani men. Scroll down for video . 'Sanitised': The BBC's website has been accused of downplaying the role of Pakistanis in Rotherham's abuse scandal. Yesterday's report singled out Pakistanis as the main perpetrators and warned of a fear of racism . Blasting the BBC's omission as 'spineless and gutless', Jane Collins, Ukip's Yorkshire and Humber MEP, told MailOnline:\u00a0'Are they worried about being racist? 'There is no way around it: the people involved in this scandal were from the Pakistani and Kahmiri communities. 'We have to be brave. It's not about racism, it's about welfare. 'Unfortunately the people involved in this worried about being called racist. We have to face up to that fact and tackle this head-on in the community.' Professor Alexis Jay, author of the council-commissioned report, highlighted political correctness as a key factor in the long-running scandal. She warned\u00a0police and council officials suppressed evidence of the crimes because they feared being labelled racist. Concerns about damage to community cohesion were put above the need to protect the vulnerable, the report said. Readers took to social media in anger accusing the Corporation of sanitising its online coverage. Reference was made to Pakistani men in the BBC's evening news broadcasts and this morning's radio. However, the lead articles online this morning simply referred to the perpetrators as 'criminal gangs'. One commenter tweeted: 'BBC unable to even say \"Pakistani\" & point fingers. If your name is Cliff Richard however, they'll send a TV helicopter. #rotherham'. Another said: 'The reference to perpetrators being virtually all Pakistani has been removed from the BBC piece #Rotherham'. And one wrote: 'Main BBC News website story on #Rotherham does not mention Asian/Pakistani once, they are \"criminal gangs\"'. The report stated: 'The issue of race, regardless of ethic group, should be tackled as an absolute priority if it is known to be a significant factor in the criminal activity of organised abuse in any local community.' Report: Professor Alexis Jay warned officers had failed to speak out for fear of being seen as racist . Council staff were given \u2018clear directions\u2019 from managers to downplay the \u2018ethnic dimension\u2019 of the abuse despite almost all the perpetrators being of Pakistani heritage. Three separate reports warning of the scale of the abuse were \u2018suppressed or ignored\u2019 by the council because it was \u2018in denial\u2019 about the crimes. Despite the appalling failures in the case, no one in authority has been sacked or even disciplined. MPs and charities said the scale of the abuse was almost \u2018incomprehensible\u2019 and called for a criminal investigation into those who helped cover it up. And at least six victims have now launched a class action against Rotherham council and could be in line for millions of pounds in compensation. A BBC spokesman said: 'Any suggestion we\u2019ve sanitised our reporting is nonsense. 'Our coverage on BBC News, including online, has made it clear that the abusers were predominately Asian and that council staff feared being labelled racist. 'Stories on the website are constantly evolving but all have clear links to articles which explain the full context. 'We spoke to members of the Pakistani community in Rotherham on Today, BBC Radio 5 live, the BBC News Channel and more reaction is expected online later.

Affluenza snared national headlines late last year when Texas teen Ethan Couch received 10 years of probation after slamming into a parked car south of Fort Worth. The struck car then slid into another vehicle moving in the opposite direction. Four people were killed, and two people riding in the bed of Couch's pickup truck were tossed and severely injured. Prosecutors wanted Couch sentenced to a maximum of 20 years behind bars, while the 16-year-old's defense team argued that Couch's well-to-do parents should share the blame for the crash because they never set limits and gave him everything he wanted. A psychologist testified that Couch was the product of affluenza and told the court that the teen's life could be turned around if he were separated from his parents and placed in a treatment program. A judge agreed, saying that if Couch violated the terms of his probation, he could face up to 10 years of incarceration, according to a statement from the Tarrant County, Texas, Criminal District Attorney's Office. \"Perhaps the notion of personal responsibility seems antiquated to some,\" Gatto said in a news release this week. \"But I think the majority of us believe that people should own up to their actions, and that criminals should not be able to use their wealth or privilege to lessen the severity of their sentences. Spoiled children shouldn't be able to spoil the chances of victims to obtain justice when a criminal act has occurred.\" Gatto's legislation, AB 1508, \"would forbid a judge or jury from reducing the sentence of a defendant who claims that being raised in a wealthy or excessively lenient household somehow explains or absolves that defendant's guilt,\" according to the news release. The bill specifically states, \"Circumstances in mitigation of the punishment prescribed by law shall not include the fact that the defendant may not have understood the consequences of his or her actions because he or she was raised in an affluent or overly permissive household.\" CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Assemblyman Mike Gatto's AB 1508 aims to ban the 'affluenza' defense in California.

Pardee Professor of Economics and Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author of \"Golden Fetters: the Gold Standard and the Great Depression, 1919-1939.\" Barry Eichengreen says strong action should be taken to stop the financial crisis from getting worse. BERKELEY, California (CNN) -- Every time the economy and stock market turn down, financial historians get predictable calls from reporters. Could this be the start of another Great Depression? Could \"it\" possibly happen again? My stock answer has always been no. The Great Depression resulted from a series of economic and financial shocks -- the end of a housing bubble in 1926 and the end of a high-tech bubble in 1929 -- but also from truly breathtaking neglect and incompetence on the part of policymakers. It couldn't happen again precisely because policymakers know this history. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is a student of the Great Depression. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson remembers the mistakes of Andrew Mellon, Herbert Hoover's treasury secretary. We can be confident, I always answered, that there will not be another Great Depression because policymakers have read financial histories like mine. At least that was my line until recently. Now I have stopped taking reporters' calls. The first thing that made the Great Depression great, of course, was the Fed's failure to act. It basically stood by as the banking system and the economy collapsed around it. This time, in contrast, the Fed can hardly be criticized for inaction. Not only has it cut rates, but it has rolled out one new unprecedented initiative after another. Unfortunately, it has reacted more than acted. First, it provided funds to the commercial banks. Then, it targeted broker-dealers. Now, it is desperately propping up the commercial paper market. All the while however, the problem has been infecting new parts of the financial system. One thing that restrained the Fed in the 1930s was the fear that rate cuts might cause capital to flee to other countries and the dollar to crash. The danger was that the same liquidity that the Fed poured in through the top of the bucket might just leak back out through these holes in the bottom. There was a solution: coordinated rate cuts here and in Europe. Unfortunately, central bankers couldn't agree on what was needed. The result was further instability. That central banks have learned this lesson of history and now see the need for coordinated action is at least one ground for hope. The problem is that they have already used their bullets. iReport.com: What lessons have your family passed down from the Great Depression? U.S. Treasury bill rates have essentially fallen to zero, and the Fed's policy interest rates are only slightly above that level. Central banks are out of ammunition. This is no longer a problem they can solve by themselves. What is needed now is Treasury action to address what has morphed into a global banking crisis. Between 1930 and 1933, not just the U.S. but also Europe and Latin America experienced rolling banking crises. When Austria took desperate measures to prop up its banking system, its banking crisis only shifted to Germany. When Germany did the same, the crisis spread to the United States. This was beggar-thy-neighbor policy at its worst. We have seen some disturbing evidence of the same in recent weeks, as when Ireland unilaterally guaranteed all bank deposits and thereby sucked funds out of the British banking system. G7 leaders, when they meet in Washington at the end of this week, need to explain exactly how they will address this aspect of the problem. They need to commit money to recapitalizing their banking systems -- now, and not next week. The U.K., which has just announced a $50 billion plan for bank recapitalization, has shown how this can be done in a matter of days. But a coordinated initiative will require the U.S. to put up a considerably larger sum. My recommendation would be to abandon the idea of reverse auctions for toxic assets and instead use the $700 billion of the recently passed rescue plan for bank recapitalization. Although the Great Depression started in 1929, it took until 1933 for American leaders to grasp this nettle and recapitalize the banks. We can't afford to wait for years this time around. A final thing that made the Great Depression such a catastrophe was that some of the worst shocks occurred right before the 1932 presidential election. There then followed an extended interregnum between the election and inauguration of the new president when no one was in charge. The outgoing president, Hoover, asked his successor designate, Franklin Roosevelt, to cooperate with him on joint statements and policies, but FDR refused to do so. Meanwhile, the banking crisis deepened. Corporations failed. The economy was allowed to spiral downward. It was this disaster that led us to amend the constitution to shorten the time between presidential election and inauguration from 4 to 2\u00bd months. The implication is clear. The two presidential candidates should be assembling their financial SWAT teams now. Paulson should promise that they will be invited into his office on November 5. This problem cannot wait until Inauguration Day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Economics professor Barry Eichengreen warns of a worsening global banking crisis, urging for bank recapitalization and presidential candidates' involvement.

It should be no surprise they tried to lure him to a poser\u2019s paradise where security is as high as the tax is low, and where the yachts are as big as the dogs are small. You can picture the hair gel glistening in the sun as his Ferrari glides by Casino Square. It is not so easy to envisage him performing to sparse crowds at the Stade Louis II, but maybe one day it will appeal. \u2018It\u2019s true we met Ronaldo,\u2019 nodded Vadim Vasilyev, Monaco\u2019s vice- president and right-hand man to billionaire owner and president, Dmitry Rybolovlev. \u2018I know Ronaldo, but it was not quite on. Monaco's days of signing A-list talent like Radamel Falcao (left) and James Rodriguez (centre) are over . Monaco have downgraded their transfer policy from signing Falcao to the likes of Dimitar Berbatov (right) Rodriguez left the principality to sign for Real Madrid for around \u00a360m in the summer . Monaco's vice president Vadim Vasilyev concedes a France FA bill and FFP regulations have cut spending . \u2018We were joking one day he might come. He likes Monaco, the project, and our president, they know each other. We sat down with Ronaldo but knowing we were looking a bit more in the distant future. We did not enter into serious discussions with Wayne Rooney, but we had contact about signing him. We were almost at the point of meeting Rio Ferdinand but he did not want to come.\u2019 These targets were set in the heady days after the Rybolovlev takeover saved AS Monaco from relegation to the French third tier and the threat of extinction in December 2011, and then restored them to Ligue 1 within 18 months. Since then, strategy has changed. A-list players are no longer such prime targets. Stars like Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez have left, but the ambition remains to keep this club at the top. The Ligue 1 club held talks with Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo during the height of their financial power . Wayne Rooney (left) and Rio Ferdinand were also courted by the formerly big spending French side . \u2018Monaco is an attractive place,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018Families and wives of players fall in love with it. For some, it\u2019s important to have a stadium full of 60,000 fans. For others, it is to have the feeling and security this country can offer. With equal terms, some players will say no, no, not Monaco, and others will say yes, yes, every time. This was the case with Falcao.\u2019 When Falcao moved on loan to Manchester United, soon after James had been sold to Real Madrid, fans protested and rumours were rife Rybolovlev was bored, feeling the pinch of his divorce or had fallen out with Prince Albert, after failing to acquire Monegasque citizenship. These were refuted by the owners, who put the policy shift down to UEFA\u2019s Financial Fair Play rules and a \u00a341.5million bill from the French FA to offset the club\u2019s tax-free status. \u2018To jump-start the project, massive investments were needed,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018Our president is a very ambitious man and we accomplished what we did. But since the summer 2013, I said: \u201cLook, there won\u2019t be massive investments.\u201d\u2019 Little known Silva Bernardo celebrates after scoring the winner in Monaco's 1-0 defeat of Nice at the weekend . Monaco's rise from the French third division to the Champions League has been bankrolled by billionaire owner\u00a0Dmitri Rybolovlev, pictured here with\u00a0Prince Albert II (right) The principality's lavish lifestyle, low taxes and high security are a lure for professional footballers . FFP rules squeezed this club, with its tiny fan base inside a nation with a population of 35,000. \u2018Nobody wants an unfair competition,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018The trick is how to implement this in real life. Is the recent (\u00a35billion) TV rights deal in England unfair to other European clubs? Can they compete at the same level when Premier League clubs can buy almost any player? \u2018Under these rules, a project like Chelsea or Manchester City is no longer possible. Is it good big clubs stay big and small ones stay small?\u2019 One arm of Monaco\u2019s new strategy is to revert to the strengths of the era when Arsene Wenger was in charge, producing talent like David Trezeguet, Lilian Thuram and Thierry Henry. Leonardo Jardim\u2019s squad is the youngest left in the Champions League, even with Ricardo Carvalho (36) and Dimitar Berbatov (34) boosting the average age to 23.9 years. Thierry Henry is one of several France legends to have been groomed at Monaco . Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim has  the youngest squad left in the Champions League . \u2018When we signed Ricky (Carvalho) there was so much criticism because of his age,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018But when I met him for the first time, at night in Madrid, in his jeep so no one would see us, I recognised his positive personality and it has helped us a lot.\u2019 Another arm of the plan is to lean on Monaco\u2019s global appeal and association with its Royal Family and Grand Prix. The club crest has been redesigned to include the word Monaco rather than the initials ASM and this season\u2019s team photo was taken at the opulent Opera de Monte Carlo. \u2018Monaco is a historic club \u2014 one of the major clubs in France \u2014 and the ambition was always to give back this identity,\u2019 said Vasilyev. \u2018We are unique. We consider ourselves part of the principality, which stands in this world for many things: luxury, sports, ecology.\u2019 Arsene Wenger will return to his former club when Arsenal face Monaco in the Champions League last 16 . The Gunners prepared for Wednesday's clash with a 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace at the weekend . They are into the knock-out stages of the Champions League for the first time in a decade and the draw against Wenger\u2019s Arsenal laces the revival story with emotion. \u2018Wenger is revered as one of the great coaches in Monaco history and one of the iconic coaches in modern football,\u2019 said Vasilyev, but he quashed the idea the 65-year-old may return to the club he led to the French title in 1988. \u2018We have to accept Arsenal is a different level in European football. He has been there for nearly 20 years and done an amazing job. We have the greatest respect but to come back to Monaco is not on the agenda. We are going for coaches who still have to grow and prove themselves and develop as part of the project.\u2019 MAY 2011 .

In video shot by Nasa and uploaded to YouTube last week, the UFO can be seen hovering just for a few seconds behind the astronauts, before the camera cuts to another angle. Scroll Down for Video . What is it? The astronaut is seen making the repairs in the center of the frame - while circled in red is the UFO . As always, the size and shape of the mysterious craft could not be made out and of course, the footage appeared grainy. The UFO appears during the video at around the 1.50 minute mark and the apparently elliptical craft hovers a short distance behind one the astronauts. Work: The astronauts carry out their work on the ISS just moments before the UFO became visible . Intricate: The three astronauts are seen here at the beginning of the video around one minute before the UFO appears . According to the Examiner one possible explanation for the UFO is that it could be one of two resupply craft that visited the ISS. The Space X Dragon ship arrived at the ISS on September 23 and that space ship was followed up two days later by a Soyuz TMA 14M craft that brought three new crew members. However, both the craft are currently docked with the ISS and the UFO in the video appears not to be attached to the ISS. A more likely explanation than a craft piloted by beings from another planet observing human astronauts is lensflare. Light could easily have bounced off the ISS and refracted onto the camera. But, observers have pointed out that there doesn't seem to be a strong source of light near to the astronauts when the UFO is seen. This may rule out lensflare and keeps the object confirmed as a genuine UFO."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A UFO with an elliptical shape was confirmed in a video of astronauts Wiseman and Gerst on an ISS spacewalk on October 7.

The FDA said it traced illnesses from the restaurants in Nebraska and Iowa to Taylor Farms de Mexico, the Mexican branch of Salinas, California-based Taylor Farms. The company, which provides produce to the food service industry, said its facility located about 180 miles north of Mexico City in San Miguel de Allende is the only one of its 12 sites to be connected to the cases. The salad mix in question includes iceberg and romaine lettuce, as well as red cabbage and carrots, according to officials. In a statement on the company's website, Taylor Farms says the Mexican facility is 'state of the art and has an exceptional food safety record.' The statement said the company is working with FDA investigators who are looking at the facility and that the product is out of the food supply.

However, a massive water diversion project begun by the Soviet Union in the 1960s has caused it to shrink dramatically - and this year, to dry up completely for the first time. This series of images from Nasa\u2019s Terra satellite reveals the shocking change. Scroll down for video . Before the project, the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya rivers flowed down from the mountains, cut northwest through the Kyzylkum Desert, and finally pooled together in the lowest part of the basin. In the 1960s, the Soviet Union undertook a major water diversion project on the arid plains of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. The region\u2019s two major rivers, fed by snowmelt and precipitation in faraway mountains, were used to transform the desert into farms for cotton and other crops. Before the project, the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya rivers flowed down from the mountains, cut northwest through the Kyzylkum Desert, and finally pooled together in the lowest part of the basin. In the 1960s, the Soviet Union undertook a major water diversion project on the arid plains of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. The region\u2019s two major rivers, fed by snowmelt and precipitation in faraway mountains, were used to transform the desert into farms for cotton and other crops. Before the project, the Syr Darya and the Amu Darya rivers flowed down from the mountains, cut northwest through the Kyzylkum Desert, and finally pooled together in the lowest part of the basin. The lake they made, the Aral Sea, was once the fourth largest in the world. Although irrigation made the desert bloom, it devastated the Aral Sea. This series of images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) on NASA\u2019s Terra satellite documents the changes. At the start of the series in 2000, the lake was already a fraction of its 1960 extent (black line). The Northern Aral Sea (sometimes called the Small Aral Sea) had separated from the Southern (Large) Aral Sea. The Southern Aral Sea had split into eastern and western lobes that remained tenuously connected at both ends. These images show the incredible changes in the region. Taken on August 15th 2001 (left) and August 19th 2014, they show the entire central area has dried up. By 2001, the southern connection had been severed, and the shallower eastern part retreated rapidly over the next several years. Especially large retreats in the eastern lobe of the Southern Sea appear to have occurred between 2005 and 2009, when drought limited and then cut off the flow of the Amu Darya. Water levels then fluctuated annually between 2009 and 2014 in alternately dry and wet years. Dry conditions in 2014 caused the Southern Sea\u2019s eastern lobe to completely dry up for the first time in modern times. As the lake dried up, fisheries and the communities that depended on them collapsed. The increasingly salty water became polluted with fertilizer and pesticides. The blowing dust from the exposed lakebed, contaminated with agricultural chemicals, became a public health hazard. According to NASA, the loss of the water's moderating influence has also led to more extreme temperatures in the region, making winters colder and summers hotter and drier. Aralsk's Mayor Alashbai Baimyrzayev points at a fishing boat on dry dock 23 March 1999 near the city of Kyzmet in the Aral Sea. The Aral Sea is actually not a sea at all. It is an immense lake, a body of fresh water, although that particular description of its contents might now be more a figure of speech than practical fact. Beginning in the 1960s, farmers and state offices in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Central Asian states opened significant diversions from the rivers that supply water to the lake, thus siphoning off millions of gallons to irrigate cotton fields and rice paddies. As recently as 1965, the Aral Sea received about 50 cubic kilometers of fresh water per year\u2014a number that fell to zero by the early 1980s. Consequently, concentrations of salts and minerals began to rise in the shrinking body of water. The Aral Sea supported a thriving commercial fishing industry employing roughly 60,000 people in the early 1960s. By 1977, the fish harvest was reduced by 75 percent, and by the early 1980s the commercial fishing industry had been eliminated. The shrinking Aral Sea has also had a noticeable affect on the region's climate. The growing season there is now shorter, causing many farmers to switch from cotton to rice, which demands even more diverted water. A secondary effect of the reduction in the Aral Sea\u2019s overall size is the rapid exposure of the lake bed. Strong winds that blow across this part of Asia routinely pick up and deposit tens of thousands of tons of now exposed soil every year. The salty dust blew off the lakebed and settled onto fields, degrading the soil. Croplands had to be flushed with larger and larger volumes of river water. The loss of the moderating influence of such a large body of water made winters colder and summers hotter and drier. In a last-ditch effort to save some of the lake, Kazakhstan built a dam between the northern and southern parts of the Aral Sea. Completed in 2005, the dam was basically a death sentence for the southern Aral Sea, which was judged to be beyond saving. All of the water flowing into the desert basin from the Syr Darya now stays in the Northern Aral Sea. Between 2005 and 2006, the water levels in that part of the lake rebounded significantly and very small increases are visible throughout the rest of the time period. The differences in water color are due to changes in sediment."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NASA's Terra satellite images show the Aral Sea's shrinkage due to a Soviet Union water diversion project, leading to the collapse of the commercial fishing industry, dependent communities, and water pollution.

It's what you might term an upset, though you suspect Alan Irvine can\u2019t have been too devastated. Not when he made 10 changes to the side he fielded in his most recent Barclays Premier League fixture. A cheer for the plucky underdog, then? Not quite. Bournemouth made the same number of changes. What a strange state of affairs, when a last-16 cup tie can\u2019t draw full enthusiasm from either club. More so when each manager would have been entitled to believe they had a good shot at a quarter-final place. That fate ultimately belongs to Bournemouth, who have reached the last eight of the Capital One Cup for the first time in their history. Bournemouth's Eunan O'Kane celebrates scoring the opening goal against West Bromwich-Albion in the Capital One Cup . Irishman O'Kane side foots his shot into the back of the net to give his Championship side the lead against their top flight opponents .

Referee: Paul Tierney 6.5. The manner of the finale was suitably dramatic. Eunan O\u2019Kane had seemingly done enough to put Bournemouth through with a strike early in the second half, only for Georgios Samaras to level with a shot that deflected heavily off Tommy Elphick. That appeared to be that for a side that has achieved so much in recent years, but then it got a little sweeter when, within seconds of the restart, substitute Callum Wilson scored the winner. What drama. It might even make this competition attractive to Bournemouth. Of course, it will need to be balanced against those priorities in the Championship, in which they are currently sitting an impressive fourth after a scarcely believable 8-0 win away at Birmingham at the weekend. Eddie Howe only retained Tommy Elphick from that team; Irvine kept Craig Dawson from the 11 who started in the draw against Crystal Palace. As it transpired, the opportunity of game time brought decent performances from players of both sides. Within two minutes, Yann Kermorgant lashed a shot from distance that Boaz Myhill saved and moments later Craig Dawson was forced to haul down Tokelo Rantie to prevent a breakaway. The fact Youssouf Mulumbu committed a similar offence later in the half said plenty about Rantie\u2019s pace on the counter, which was evidently Bournemouth\u2019s main ploy. At the other end, West Brom threatened without looking dangerous. Scoring hasn\u2019 t been a problem for them in the Premier League \u2013 a tally of 12 that stands up to scrutiny against their rivals in the bottom half - but for a time here they looked ponderous.

Substitute Giorgios Samaras doesn't celebrate after his cross leads to an own goal equaliser for West Brom . Tommy Elphick was unlucky to have crept Samaras's cross past Cherries keeper Lee Camp . Nothing too blatant\u00a0at set-pieces. C . raig\u00a0Dawson and Gareth\u00a0McAuley were both happy to get close at\u00a0corners for West Brom, but nothing\u00a0especially untoward. When Christian Gamboa crossed from the right, Liam O\u2019Neil slipped his marker but barely connected with his header. Victor Anichebe also played in Brown Ideye, but the \u00a310million striker shot straight at Lee Camp. They started the second half with a shade more incision, Sebastian Blanco sidestepping a challenge and dipping a shot narrowly over the bar from the edge of the area. But by the 49th minute they were behind. Considering they came into the fixture with a single away win this season and only one draw, perhaps it should not have been a surprise. Junior Stanislas made the goal, surging at a backline that kept on retreating. He reached the edge of the area unchallenged and slipped a pass left to O\u2019Kane, who shot across Myhill and inside the far post. Ryan Fraser then came close to making it 2-0. The winger\u2019s pace caused West Brom problems most of the night but his finishing let him down when Adam Smith found space on the right and drilled a low cross towards the penalty spot. Fraser controlled with his back to goal, but in shooting on the turn miscued horribly. Samaras levelled after 85 minutes with a heavily deflected shot from the left, but substitute Wilson hit the winner seconds later. Howe threw his hands in the air. He has overseen a special time at Bournemouth. He took the club into the Championship in his first season at the club and consolidated their status by finishing 10th in the last campaign. At the weekend, they obliterated Birmingham and sit in the play-off places. Now they are in a hat with only seven other numbers. Not bad for a second string from the second tier.

Once the Frebbles have connected to each other through the internet, when one user squeezes their device, the other user will feel the sensation of their hand being held. They do this thanks to two pressure sensors at the front of each device to register squeezing, two vibration motors on the side to make the sensation feel more real, and one integrated 'squeeze bar' to replicate holding hands.

And federal government offices in the area will be closed on Tuesday. But the snow isn't the only thing to worry about. \"We are going to see high snowfall amounts, but the ice is what is going to be the big story,\" CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray said, pointing at North Carolina. Raleigh, North Carolina, could see up to a half-inch of ice, which could knock out power and \"makes travel nearly impossible,\" she said. The bitter cold is coming from several fronts. This weekend, the Northeast weathered its fourth snowstorm in three weeks, and extremely low temperatures are predicted to hang around for two more weeks. A winter storm stretching across the Midwest and Southeast is bringing freezing rain and ice accumulation, especially from Arkansas to Tennessee. Late Monday, Tennessee declared a state of emergency as road conditions quickly deteriorated and power outages spiked. Temperatures across the eastern half of the United States will be below average for the entire week, and that's a big deal as winter fatigue sets in. In Boston, where 95 inches of snow have already been recorded this year, the latest storm was expected to skirt by and bring a few more inches, Gray said. This February is the city's snowiest month ever. Frank Ippolito, the owner of a snow removal business operating in Boston, said his staff was weary from lack of sleep. At this point, his snowplow drivers are putting snow \"anywhere and everywhere there's an open piece of land that won't obstruct the view safely of the driver or prevent someone from getting out of a doorway or moving a car,\" he said. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said one man died after suffering a heart attack while shoveling snow. \"Please stay close to your home today -- shovel in short stints,\" he said. Mounting \"snow rage\" is pitting drivers and neighbors against each other as the winter weather shows no sign of letting up, CNN affiliate WFXT reported. \"We've been noticing a little frustration out there on the roads,\" Massachusetts State Police trooper Kathryn Downey said. \"I think people are getting pushed to their limits.\" Margo Souza of Charlestown, Massachusetts, told CNN's iReport she was trying to take the snow in stride, even though it has doubled her commute. Her golden retrievers, Logan and Copley, love to bound around in it. Still, she said she was hoping her city's baseball team might bring something with them when they head south for spring training. \"Send the snow to Florida,\" she said, \"along with the Red Sox equipment.\" One New York resident, Max Guliani, posted photos on Twitter of the frozen fountain at Bryant Park in New York City. A pipe burst at the city's iconic Empire State Building, forcing one of its observatories to shut down, a spokeswoman said. In Ithaca, in upstate New York, temperatures have gotten so cold that even the city's tourism website is telling people to head to the Sunshine State. \"That's it. We surrender,\" the website says. \"Winter, you win. Key West anyone?\" Do you see mountains of snow or freezing rain outside your window, but have friends in Florida or California who don't understand the big deal with the severe winter weather? Pick a weather factoid to share with them (via CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller): . \u2022 Wind chills in the Northeast make it feel as cold as -40 degrees Fahrenheit (-40 Celsius). \u2022 Monday was the coldest morning in Boston since 2004, at -3 degrees Fahrenheit (-19 Celsius). \u2022 More than 55 million people live in areas that are currently under a wind chill warning or advisory. \u2022 An additional 50 million are under winter storm warnings, stretching from Oklahoma to South Carolina and up to New Jersey. As a weary Northeast remains buried in snow, the South and Midwest are gearing up for a messy mix of snow, sleet and ice. Snowfall records have been broken in the Northeast, and now, more than a dozen other states, stretching from Kansas and Oklahoma to North Carolina and Virginia, are bracing for inclement weather. \"It's been about 10 years since we've had something this significant,\" said Doug Hamilton, chief of public services in Louisville, Kentucky. In Lexington, plows are working around the clock, Mayor Jim Gray told CNN affiliate WLEX. Already, he said, parts of the city have seen between 6-11 inches of snow, which he described as \"very unusual.\" Southern Indiana could see up to 10 inches of snow, while northern Kentucky faces between 8 and 14 inches, the National Weather Service said. \"Travel will be treacherous with some roads nearly impassable,\" the National Weather Service warned. \"Have an emergency kit of blankets, food, water and flashlights if you must travel.\" In addition to slick roads, trees may come down because of snow accumulations, causing power outages. Forecasters warned residents in affected areas to defer travel on rural roads until Tuesday. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley ordered various agencies on alert, including the  Emergency Management Agency,  the state National Guard and law enforcement agencies. \"State agencies are on standby to coordinate resources to support the needs of Alabama counties if necessary,\"  he said. In Missouri, St. Louis braced for heavy snow Monday, possibly into overnight, CNN affiliate KMOV reported. School districts in cities such as Little Rock, Arkansas, shut down in expectation of wintry weather. Nashville saw relentless freezing rain starting before dawn Monday, and snowplows were already at work. Three to 7 inches of snow are forecast there in the next 24 hours. Southwest Airlines on Monday canceled all flights to and from Nashville International Airport, airport spokeswoman Shannon Sumrall said. Southwest accounts for more than half of the commercial flights at the airport, she said. Only a handful of Delta and American Airlines flights departed Monday. Wintry weather is in the eye of the beholder. The Northeast is urging drivers to stay off roads as the fourth storm in three weeks drops snow that, for Boston, has exceeded 45 inches in February alone. It takes a fraction of that to get residents in the South into emergency mode. Sometimes, it doesn't even have to snow; just the possibility of wintry weather is enough for a partial shutdown. The Weather Service issued a winter storm watch for northern Georgia, warning of potential snow and ice accumulation on the roads. Temperatures dropped in the Atlanta area Monday, and even though the forecast suggested the snow/ice mix would fall farther north, some school districts closed out of caution. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency for 15 northern Georgia counties and asked state workers there to work from home if they're not involved in emergency response. \"The danger, of course, with moisture on our roadways and the temperature dropping, is the fear of black ice,\" Deal said, according to CNN affiliate WSB. \"And that is the most significant threat that we see.\" Residents loaded up on food and other supplies, memories of last year's storm probably fresh in their minds.

Fire exploding into tree crowns and launching a thousand bright brands. Fire taking your breath and replacing it with fire. Or at least that's what if feels like during a blow-up. Of course, fire stories like those are told by the living. On Sunday in Arizona, 19 Granite Mountain hotshots battling the Yarnell Fire lost their lives when things got bad too fast. Their story is now being pieced together out of the ashes by those who were not there with them. And there they were. ... But why were they there? Why were 19 men who were so full of life so drawn to this dangerous occupation? Remembering the firefighters . I started on a Montana hotshot crew years ago and worked 12 fire seasons as a Forest Service smokejumper, parachuting to fight wildfires in the West and Alaska. It was hard work and high adventure -- the best job I've ever had, the best people with whom I've worked. Like the Yarnell hotshots, we charged toward the fires, lugging heavy packs and swinging heavy tools, digging firelines and felling trees, separating the fuels from the fires. My first jump fire was a two-manner, high on Mogollon Baldy Peak in New Mexico. Roger Mello and I fought a small lightning fire, until another huge bolt exploded a ponderosa pine tree right below us in a blast so bright that I saw its afterimage for an entire minute. We put out that fire and then were helicoptered out, to land in front of magnificent and ancient cliff dwellings. I was hooked, just like thousands of other wildland firefighters. There were always close calls. In Alaska, with a fire pressing us, we built an island of rocks out in a small lake and stood on it to let the fire blow past us. On another fire call, our Twin Beech crash-landed on the edge of the Yukon River. We squeezed out through a wing window as the plane began to burn. In Idaho's River of No Return Wilderness, with the fire heating up below us, we sawed down a dead tree and used its trunk as a battering ram to bust up a granite reef and build a helicopter landing pad. Of course, we should not have been up on that ridge top with the fire cooking below us. The phrase, \"And there we were ...\" whispers the cause of almost every firefighting fatality. Firefighters sometimes go -- and sometimes they are sent -- where they should never have gone. Norman Maclean's famous book, \"Young Men and Fire,\" about the 1949 Mann Gulch Fire incident, which took 13 smoke jumpers' lives, reads like a classic Greek tragedy, complete with lessons of hubris and fate. Nonfirefighters often love that book. But firefighters will read it and shake their heads. All we can think is that they shouldn't have gone down there. Lookout warned team before fire killed 19 . Firefighting deaths are never classical tragedies. However, those who perish fighting fires are indeed heroes. Their last moments are pinnacles of high emotion and drama. Hold your breath and imagine it. In 1994, a fire crew was caught on Colorado's Storm King Mountain by a fire flashing up through brush that had already burned once. Some sheltered. Some ran. Two made it out over the ridgetop. When rescuers arrived, they found a surreal scene. The bodies they found lower on the slope were burned beyond recognition. Those they found higher had been caught in a blast that was extreme but brief. Their bodies appeared as though they had been bronzed. They looked like Rodin statues, cast in their last moments of heroic, doomed struggle. There they were. And there the Yarnell 19 were, on their Arizona fire last Sunday where they should not have been. And yet they were so right to want to be there. They were more alive than most of us are, more vital, more committed and more sincere in their lives. They fought fire to protect others' lives and property. They shouldered the burden and faced the dangers. As heroes do. God bless the Yarnell 19.

Foreign visitors and short-term migrants cost the NHS \u00a32billion a year, an official report warns today. The first comprehensive assessment of \u2018health tourism\u2019 says the true cost to taxpayers is up to 100 times bigger than some estimates. It concluded the Health Service has \u2018some of the most generous rules in the world\u2019. And it even found evidence of relatives of migrants taking advantage of visits to Britain to have free treatment. Costly: A report estimated the health tourism costs the NHS up to \u00a32billion a year . The bill was put at between \u00a31.9billion and \u00a32billion\u00a0 \u2013 with only around 16 per cent of the money clawed back. The Government said it would be \u2018impractical or inappropriate\u2019 to charge in full some patients, such as students or those with infectious diseases. However Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt hopes to recover up to \u00a3500million a year, arguing Britain cannot afford an \u2018international health service\u2019. The study estimates that \u00a3388million goes on foreign patients who should pay for their care but are never charged. Health tourists \u2013 those who specifically travel to the UK for treatment \u2013 cost up to \u00a3300million more. The Home Office plans a new annual levy of \u00a3150 on foreign students and \u00a3200 on temporary migrants. The surcharge is expected to generate \u00a3200million. Extra strain: According to Professor Thomas, the NHS levy will make coming to the UK for treatment even more attractive . Angry: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt vows to recover \u00a3500m and blasts our 'international health service' Today's findings will prove highly controversial \u2013 and are likely to be hotly disputed by the Left-wing medical establishment. Labour suggested earlier this year . that the Government was \u2018xenophobic\u2019 for proposing charges for more . temporary visitors and migrants. The situation is complex when it . comes to deciding in practice who is and who is not eligible for free . NHS hospital treatment. Data on migrants in the UK is limited, and that . which has previously been compiled is of very poor quality. The Government admits that today\u2019s . twin reports on the scale of the problem are, by definition, based on . incomplete information and a series of assumptions and must be treated . with some caution. The documents concede that the . definition of \u2018health tourists\u2019 can vary widely, applying to people who . come here deliberately to obtain free healthcare, and others who are . simply frequent visitors who register with GPs. Researchers conducted telephone . interviews with 36 senior officials at a cross-section of NHS trusts, . and interviews with nine Border Force and immigration enforcement . officers based at five major airports.\u00a0 Seven trusts involved the study . were visited and a range of staff, from clinicians through to front line . staff, were interviewed face-to-face. To collect data about the number of . migrants and overseas visitors in a more consistent way; a \u2018diary\u2019 was . distributed to NHS staff taking part in the study inviting them to keep a . record of all patients brought to their attention over a two-week . period. Mr Hunt said: \u2018Having a universal . health service free at the point of use rightly makes us the envy of the . world, but we must make sure the system is fair to the hardworking . British taxpayers who fund it. \u2018It\u2019s . time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service \u2013 not an . international one. With the NHS already under pressure from an ageing . population, it cannot be right that large amounts of taxpayers\u2019 money is . being lost through treating people who should be paying from foreign . countries.\u2019 Ministers have . appointed Sir Keith Pearson, former chief of the NHS Confederation, as . an adviser on \u2018visitor and migrant cost recovery\u2019. He will bring in . measures to identify those who should pay and find ways of making them . do so. Estimates of the cost of \u2018health tourism\u2019 have varied from \u00a320million to \u00a3200million, sparking much political controversy. Kailash . Chand, of the British Medical Association, insisted earlier this year: . \u2018Believe me, there is little evidence that health tourism is a . significant burden on the NHS. The \u00a340million allegedly written off over . the last four years by hospitals in England and Wales is approximately . 0.01 per cent of the NHS budget over the period.\u2019 Diane . Abbott, then a Labour health spokesman, suggested charging foreigners . for care was \u2018xenophobic\u2019 and Clare Gerada of the Royal College of GPs . said: \u2018It is important we do not overestimate the problem.\u2019 But even if only 75 per cent of the \u00a3500million target is recovered, it would pay the salaries of almost 4,000 doctors. Free care is offered to temporary visitors and students, unlike in Spain, where students must pay \u00a350 a month. Australia charges \u00a3260 a year for restricted private health insurance for students. The Home Office\u2019s Immigration Bill will create the powers to increase the number of migrants who will have to pay to access healthcare. Labour pointed out that the figures from the Department of Health were based on \u2018incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions\u2019. Andy Burnham, Opposition health spokesman, said: \u2018We are in favour of improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment. 'More spin than substance': Opposition health spokesman Andy Burnham dismissed today's report . \u2018But it\u2019s hard not to conclude that this announcement is more about spin than substance. The Government\u2019s own report undermines their headline-grabbing figures, admitting they are based on old and incomplete data. \u2018Instead of grandstanding, the government need to focus on delivering practical changes. Labour would not support changes that make doctors and nurses surrogate immigration officials.\u2019 Earlier this year, the Mail highlighted a warning from a consultant of the \u2018massive and escalating problem\u2019 of foreigners travelling to Britain to exploit the NHS. Professor J Meirion Thomas, of The Royal Marsden hospital in London, suggested in an article for the Spectator magazine that expectant mothers were arriving in this country just to give birth, while others are flying here for cancer, HIV, kidney and infertility treatment and leaving without paying. The Government estimates that in hospitals alone fewer than 50 per cent of chargeable foreign nationals are identified."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Health tourism costs the NHS \u00a32 billion annually, based on limited, poor quality migrant data.

The show began with a blitzkrieg of video, as four hanging, shifting circular video screens joined four giant stationary ones is projecting Rihanna's arrival. She wore an electric blue mini-trenchcoat and hot pink stilleto boots with neon green heels and immediately belted out her Number One hit, \"Only Girl (In the World)\" from her 2010 album, also titled \"Loud.\" Photos: Rihanna's Best Looks . Before the audience could catch its breath, the singer had tossed the trench, revealing a day-glo bikini, picked up a gang of matching day-glo-covered back-up dancers and shifted directly into \"Disturbia,\" another Number One hit, this one from 2007's \"Good Girl Gone Bad\" -- and then seamlessly segued into another hit, 2007's \"Shut Up and Drive,\" replete with back-up dancers dressed as crash-test dummies bashing a neon-graffiti-covered car with bats. Over nearly two hours -- a very long set for such a busy production -- Rihanna maintained a relentless pace, working her way through 24 songs, six different wardrobes and endless set changes, all without any significant energy dip. The deft production included several built-in musical and video interludes -- including a staggering number of guitar solos -- to keep from going dark during the changes. Excerpts from Rihanna's Rolling Stone Cover Story . One of the most impressive spectacles was a very erotic S&M-themed mini-set, launched with a fairly faithful cover of Prince's \"Darling Nikki,\" during which Rihanna, dressed in a tuxedo and toting a cane, spanked, groped and pretended to smack three nearly nude female dancers. By the time she had transitioned into \"Loud's\" \"S&M\" -- another Number One hit -- Rihanna's tux had been stripped off to reveal a white bondage corset and she was wearing handcuffs. Nearly nude men and a female audience member were added to the mix before the whole thing ended (cutely) in a pillow fight. In a military-themed mini-set including 2009 hit \"Hard,\" Rihanna rode in atop a double-barreled pink tank that shot T-shirts into the crowd, flanked by sexy-soldier costumed dancers with pink rifles. When \"Breakin' Dishes\" segued into \"Glamorous Life,\" the singer barreled to the back of the arena, where she rode a platform revealing Sheila E-style stand-up drums and played an impressive solo.

Back in 2001 -- in the 16th game of the fifth set -- members of Goran Ivanisevic's entourage asked for divine intervention as the Croatian sought to close out the encounter against Australia's Patrick Rafter and end years of Wimbledon heartache. Ivanisevic himself asked for help from above, he wanted the same ball when serving, and Australian and Croatian spectators on Centre Court roared encouragement between points to make for a football like atmosphere. Ivanisevic had lost three previous Wimbledon finals and seemed destined to miss out on glory at the All England Club given he had struggled with a shoulder injury earlier in 2001 and contemplated retirement. His ranking of 125th wasn't even high enough to land direct entry into the tournament. Wimbledon gave Ivanisevic a wildcard, however, and he proceeded to work his way through the draw with a little help from Wimbledon's famed and all too frequent rain gods. So there he was against Rafter on \"People's Monday,\" leading 8-7 in the fifth set, four points from winning the most prestigious tennis tournament in the world. No ordinary player -- and character -- one sensed that if Ivanisevic held serve, he would do it the hard way. He had to overcome a resilient Rafter -- and painful memories of defeats to Pete Sampras, twice, and Andre Agassi. It proved to be the case. A forehand volley went long by a large margin for 0-15. At 15-all, he double faulted. Having hit an ace to get to championship point, he subsequently double faulted again -- by a yard. A second championship point came and went with another double fault, this time into the net, and a third was saved by Rafter with a lob that was good enough against an Ivanisevic too frozen to jump. Rafter finally buckled on a fourth match point, the pressure from Ivanisevic's destructive serve finally too much to repel. A return sailed into the net and Ivanisevic was the Wimbledon champion and the only wildcard to bag the men's title at noted postcode SW19. Dedication to a fallen friend . He worked his way into his players' box and exchanged hugs with his team, which included father Srdjan, who had recently undergone a triple heart bypass. Ivanisevic dedicated the victory to former NBA star Drazen Petrovic, who died in a car accident in 1993. \"The best moment is when you hold the trophy,\" Ivanisevic told CNN's Open Court before the start of Wimbledon. This year's men's final will be played on Sunday. \"I was watching too many guys holding that beautiful trophy. I had this (runner-up) plate at home,\" added Ivanisevic. \"It's a nice plate but you don't want to have that plate at home. \"Nobody cares for second place. If you want to go back now and think of Wimbledon finalists in the past 15 years, to be honest, I have no idea.\" Ivanisevic almost didn't get that far. He trailed Britain's Tim Henman two sets to one in the semifinals, losing the third 6-0 in about 15 minutes. He was out of sorts. That's when the unpredictable British weather saved Ivanisevic and hurt the local darling. With Henman holding a 2-1 advantage in the fourth set on the second Friday of the fortnight, rain fell and the contest was suspended. They returned Saturday and Ivanisevic, mentally fresher, claimed the fourth set in a tiebreak. A further suspension ensured the nervy affair had to be completed Sunday, with Ivanisevic eliminating Henman 6-3 in the fifth to disappoint a nation. A Monday final beckoned against Rafter, himself a loser to Sampras -- the king of Wimbledon prior to Roger Federer's arrival -- in the 2000 finale. Fans queued up overnight to land one of the 10,000 unreserved tickets made available for the final, leading to a more vocal climax than usual. \"It was good that it was on a Monday because three finals I lost on Sunday, so finally I played on Monday,\" Ivanisevic said. \"Unbelievable atmosphere, probably never again because now they have a roof. \"Patrick is a very good friend, a great guy. We both should have won Wimbledon before, him in 2000 in the final, and I was supposed to win a long time ago.\" After Ivanisevic beat Carlos Moya in the second round he sensed something special was about to happen. Did it the hard way . Besides Henman and Rafter, Ivanisevic also topped Andy Roddick, Greg Rusedski and Marat Safin in a difficult draw. Of his seven victims, only one -- first-round opponent Fredrik Jonsson -- would never feature in the top four in the rankings. \"It was an unsolved mystery how I won, but I felt after the second round that I was going to win,\" Ivanisevic said. \"I could not say it loud because they would think I was completely nuts. \"I felt for the first time after so many months, actually a year, the racket (that I played with had a special sound). I lost the sound for a year and a half and that (first) Monday I got the sound back. I said, 'This is a good sign.'\" The sound had vanished when Ivanisevic began the year by playing in qualifying at the Australian Open. Stuck on a back court after playing in some of the world's grandest stadiums, he tanked -- a tennis term for not trying. Although unpleasant at the time, it proved to be that year's turning point for Ivanisevic. \"I had a long journey to think about what I was going to do, then I went to play a challenger in Germany,\" Ivanisevic said. \"I played the final. Then I started to play better. I didn't have great results but I started to enjoy it again. \"Wimbledon came and it was actually my time,\" added Ivanisevic, who can still be seen on the seniors' tour, while he also helps run a tournament in Zagreb and dabbles in commentating. \"It was written somewhere that it was my time. I did everything in my life the harder way. Why do it easy if you can do it the hard way?\" But by doing it the hard way, the larger-than-life Ivanisevic has ensured his achievement at Wimbledon will never be forgotten."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In 2001, Goran Ivanisevic won the Wimbledon championship against Patrick Rafter.

Look to a place where the housing collapse began: Phoenix, Arizona. \"We're talking about (home) prices being 3 to 4% higher than last year, which most people don't believe because they're used to bad news,\" said Mike Orr, director of Arizona State University's Center of Real Estate Theory and Practice. Orr's new report on the Phoenix market shows a direct reverse of the situation that sparked a massive housing bubble. Monthly foreclosure starts have fallen 49% since a year ago. Home sales are up 8%. The result? What had been a market with far more housing supply than demand has now become a place where buyers have to act fast and beat out heavy competition. CNN Radio's Lisa Desjardins reports on the turnaround in Phoenix . \"It's no longer difficult to sell your house here,\" Orr told CNN Radio. \"If you price it at market, it well sell quickly. The supply situation is unusually low.\" Supply is down some 42%, Orr estimates, from September 2008. Top 10 turnaround towns . That is a dramatic turnaround for an area that once had a massive supply glut. According to Orr's predecessor at ASU, Jay Butler, during the recession foreclosures hit an eye-popping 12% of the homes in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix. But now Orr's report indicates that supply has been soaked up and Phoenix is again becoming a seller's market where buyers must stand in line and move fast. \"(The listing) came out on the market on a Friday morning. We looked at it Friday afternoon and put a bid on it Friday night,\" said homeowner Tim Woodward of his new house. He and his fianc\u00c3\u00a9, Susan Rust, are combining their two families, which includes five teenage girls who will all live at home. \"So we need space,\" Rust said. She and Woodward had already lost bids on other homes and decided to put in a contract on what would become their home while sitting in the driveway after their walk-through. \"According to the neighbors, there were 11 other couples who went through this house,\" Rust said. \"So you have to be quick.\" BofA to slash mortgage balances by $100,000 or more . Rust and Woodward got their five-bedroom, three-bath house in Tempe for $290,000, 40% less than the asking price a few years ago. But neither the homeowners nor the experts think buyers are getting bargains anymore. They believe prices have already passed their low point, hit their natural floor and are rising again. This is not the housing market of a year, or even eight months ago. \"It's getting very, very tough to find a real bargain nowadays,\" said Mark Stapp, a Phoenix real estate developer who also teaches at the Center for Real Estate Theory and Practice at ASU's Carey School of Business. The classic bargains, foreclosures and bank-owned properties, are drying up. According to Orr's new report, the number of homes reverting to lenders in the Phoenix area is down 62% since January 2011. Trustee sales of foreclosed properties are down 42%. \"The market has tightened up substantially,\" Stapp said. \"In fact, I know of investors coming to town and leaving very disappointed because they thought they'd find huge bargains and they can't find them.\" The question is, will this trend last? Orr, a self-professed data addict, says the numbers indicate a fundamental shift in the market. \"If there is a major economic crisis that we haven't foreseen, things can go back to square one,\" he said. \"But this is not just a slight trend.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\nSao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazil's presidential vote is headed for a runoff. Preliminary election results from the South American country show President Dilma Rousseff in the lead. But she didn't get the majority necessary to win in the first round. With more than 99% of votes counted, Rousseff had 41.56% of votes, Brazil's Supreme Electoral Court said. Aecio Neves was in second place with 33.60%. And Marina Silva was in third place with 21.30%. Exit polls Sunday indicated there would be a runoff between Rousseff, the incumbent, and Neves, a center-right candidate. In a poll conducted by the Ibope public research firm, Rousseff won 44% of votes, Neves won 30% and Silva won 22%. Silva, an environmentalist candidate for the Brazilian Socialist Party, had gained momentum and backing from a growing number of supporters leading up to the vote, with polls before the election placing her in second place. She joined the race after candidate Eduardo Campos died in a plane crash and was seen as a political outsider who could combat corruption. But while she succeeded in gaining much broader support that polls had initially predicted for her party, her third-place finish puts her out of the running for the presidency. Rousseff, 66, was once a Marxist rebel who was allegedly tortured in the early 1970s during Brazil's former dictatorship. With her trademark pixie-short hair style and thick glasses, she became one of most Brazil's most wanted fugitives, branded by some as a \"subversive Joan of Arc.\" She has a solid track record in running the executive office. Before becoming the country's first female president in 2011, Rousseff, from the Workers' Party, was chief of staff to former President Lula da Silva. She democratized Brazil's electricity sector through the \"Luz Para Todos\" (Light for All) program, which made electricity widely available, even in rural areas. Rousseff presided over the soccer World Cup in Brazil, but she took a lot of political flack over how public money was spent. Streets filled with hundreds of thousands of demonstrators questioning the morality of pumping so much money into stadiums instead of programs to fight poverty and build infrastructure. Rousseff defended the spending, saying the vast majority of funds earmarked for infrastructure projects were spent on projects for the nation, not the soccer tournament. And Rousseff claims that under the presidencies of her predecessor and herself, masses of Brazilians have risen out of poverty. \"We have also mainstreamed into the middle class no less than 42 million people,\" she has said. But inflation is now weighing down that progress. Neves, a 54-year-old economist, is a well-known name and a career politician. His campaign slogan promises reforms to lower inflation and encourage more investment in the country: \"The sure path for Brazil to really change.\" The pro-business candidate belongs to the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, one of the country's strongest. His grandfather, Tancredo Neves, was elected to become Brazil's president in 1985 but died before taking office. Neves says he began his political career campaigning at his grandfather's side. \"What motivates me in politics is an enormous love of Brazil, a limitless desire to see things improve, to see Brazil go the right way,\" he says in a campaign video. While he'd been trailing in some polls leading up to the election, Neves said the only poll that mattered was Sunday's official vote. \"Let's get to the second round,\" he said in a YouTube video on Saturday. Both Rousseff and Neves thanked supporters in speeches Sunday night. Rousseff has promised her second term will be different, running under the slogan of \"New Government, New Ideas.\" \"Once again, the people have honored me with their trust by giving me victory in the first round,\" she said. A video posted on Neves' Twitter feed Sunday night showed cheering supporters carrying him as cameras flashed. This has been one of the tightest election competitions in recent years, and it's likely to intensify in the coming weeks, with both candidates vying for the votes that went to Silva in the first round. There will be three more weeks of campaigning before the runoff. CNN's Shasta Darlington reported from Sao Paulo. Catherine E. Shoichet and Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Brazil's presidential election requires a runoff.

When the Human Rights Watch interviewer and his colleagues returned home, they titled their report \"They burned my heart: War crimes in Northern Idlib during peace plan negotiations.\" \"Those words were chosen because what we saw and heard evidence of were systematic executions and torture -- war crimes -- by the Syrian government forces,\" he said. \"It's been frustrating to record these stories and then hear more negotiating,\" said Solvang, who describes in a video what he saw. \"I think it's clear that there are attempts to undermine the peace plan.\" This week, a bomb exploded near a United Nations convoy of workers tasked with monitoring whether a peace plan is working. On Thursday, two car bombs also exploded outside a key government intelligence compound in Damascus. For much of the 14-month uprising, the capital city, home to many al-Assad supporters, has been largely untouched by the violence. Thursday's explosions, which killed more than 50 people, are believed to mark a major point in the conflict. More violence came Friday, according to an opposition group. Five people in Homs and Hama were killed by government forces: Three were shot by snipers, and two were tortured to death, a spokesperson said. The architect of the peace plan, Kofi Annan, the United Nations special envoy to Syria, has said that he is now weighing an invitation to meet with al-Assad. Al-Assad's government faults \"terrorists,\" the term it uses to describe the opposition and rationalize security forces' crackdown. His regime has banned foreign journalists, and several of those who've attempted to report on what's happening in Syria have been injured or killed. Solvang and his team knew the risk they took in entering Syria. They avoided checkpoints and kept a low profile. They visited homes in the province of Idlib and say they hundreds of ruined homes in various towns, many probably from systemic house-by-house arson attacks. Many of the male opposition fighters who once lived in the area's towns have fled, Solvang said. Many women, children and the elderly remain, yet they are being targeted with equal brutality, he said. Several of the 65 witnesses and victims who talked to Human Rights Watch were mothers or wives. They say government forces broke into their homes and executed their families. Three of the victims were children. At 33, Solvang is already an experienced conflict documentarian, interviewing victims of violence in Russia, the North Caucasus and Sri Lanka. He has focused on Syria since the anti-Assad movement exploded in March 2011. But still, he cannot get one mother out of his head. \"She was telling me how the government forces had detained her son and how she had tried to be nice and quiet and cooperative, hoping they would release him,\" Solvang said. \"But as soon as the soldiers left, they told her, 'You have to forget your son.' \" Three days later, the woman found her son's body, riddled with signs of torture, in a village cemetery. \"The courage she had despite (what she went through) and the way she described how she found his body afterward, that made quite a great impact on me,\" he said. Solvang says another mother suffered similarly. The woman recalled how her three sons -- all in their early 20s -- were awakened in the middle of the night by fighters in uniform who identified themselves as \"Bashar's men.\" The fighters demanded to know why the sons owned a pants of a style seen worn at demonstrations. The mother desperately tried to explain that the pants were common, that they were the only style available at the town market. The fighters, she said, ransacked the house and forced the sons outside. The mother ran after them, but the \"soldiers pushed me back inside,\" she said. She describes what happened: \"About an hour later, a neighbor came in and said there was a fire nearby, that the army set some cars and a motorcycle on fire, and the neighbors needed more water. My daughters and I went out with buckets, and then my daughters, who were in front, ran to me, saying that my sons were there as well. \"After we extinguished the fire, we found their bodies. Bilal was shot in the middle of his forehead, Yousef behind his ear, and Talal was shot by two bullets, in the head and in the back.\" The mother told Human Rights Watch, \"I just wish I were killed and I didn't have to see that.\" Several of the victims of summary executions were teenagers; three were children, and several were older than 60, the group documented. Though Solvang has interviewed victims in numerous conflicts, Syria stands out to him because of the estimated tens of thousands of people who rights workers suspect have been unlawfully detained. \"But it's really unclear how many. No one really knows for sure,\" he said. Also unusual is what he says is Syrian authorities' widespread, systematic use of certain torture techniques: Electricity is often used. Syrians have also come up with a name for being hogtied; they call it the \"flying carpet.\" Solvang was also struck by people who victims described accompanying their attackers. These people often wear masks and may be locals or people familiar with the victims. One man recalled to Human Rights Watch that while a Syrian official brutalized him, a man with his attacker spouted personal information about him. \"Ask him about his cousin who happens to be a lawyer who is active with the opposition,\" the man said. Another section of the report details the execution of 19 boys and men in the village of Taftanaz on April 3. Human Rights Watch was able to observe bullet marks near several of the alleged killings: all in a row, about 50 to 60 centimeters above the floor, indicating that the victims were probably kneeling when they were shot. Less than a week earlier, in late March, al-Assad announced that he would implement the United Nations peace plan."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ole Solvang of Human Rights Watch reported on war crimes in Syria, including specific torture techniques.

Sen. Joe Biden credits his mother with teaching him to stand up for the little guy. The moderator asked Biden, who was described by the Los Angeles Times as a \"gaffe machine,\" if he could reassure voters that he would have enough verbal discipline needed for the world stage. \"Yes,\" Biden replied with a grin and a twinkle in his eyes. The moderator, NBC anchorman Brian Williams, waited for Biden to elaborate, but a still-grinning Biden said nothing more. Nervous titters spread through the crowd until the audience erupted in laughter. The Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama may be known for his eloquence. But Biden, his vice presidential running mate, can handle himself behind the podium as well. He is known for his ability to throw a verbal punch. Biden, often called the \"scrappy kid from Scranton,\" Pennsylvania, once described as \"bulls**t\" and \"malarkey\" President Bush's alleged implication that Obama wanted to appease terrorists by talking to nations that Washington considers terrorist states. He delivered this savage putdown of former Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani: \"There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, a verb and 9/11.\"  See Biden campaign photos \u00bb . Yet Biden's frankness can end up hurting him more than his intended target. During the Democratic presidential primaries, he was widely criticized for describing Obama as \"the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean.\" More recently, Biden attracted attention for telling a crowd that Sen. Hillary Clinton \"might have been a better pick\" as Obama's running mate. Biden has weathered plenty of public bruises during his 36 years as a politician. But his private battles have been even more dramatic.  See timeline of Biden's life \u00bb . Jeffrey Rosen, writing for The New Republic magazine, said Biden's willingness to mix it up comes from his working-class upbringing in Scranton during the 1950s. Biden's father managed a car dealership and lectured his son at the dinner table about the horrors of the Holocaust. His dad once quit his job when he saw his boss throw silver dollars on the floor and watched his employees scramble for them, Rosen said. Biden's mother taught her son to stand up for the little guy as well, Rosen said, before highlighting a passage from Biden's autobiography, \"Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics.\" \"The one thing my mother could not stand was meanness,\" Biden writes. \"She once shipped my brother off with instructions to bloody the nose of a kid who was picking on smaller kids. Religious figures and authority figures got no exemption. They abuse their power, you bloody their nose.\" Biden took that pugnacious attitude into the political arena. After earning a law degree from Syracuse University, he won a Senate seat at age 29 representing Delaware in 1972 -- in a surprise victory. He eventually became the chairman of the powerful Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees, establishing himself as an authority on national security issues and the Supreme Court. In the 1980s, Biden led the Judiciary Committee through the explosive hearing for controversial conservative Judge Robert Bork. In 2005, one of Biden's distinctive moments on that committee came when he questioned Supreme Court chief justice nominee John Roberts during the confirmation hearings. Roberts, who would eventually sail through the hearings, had told committee members that he was not an ideologue but more like a judicial umpire who called balls and strikes. \"As much as I respect your metaphor, it's not very apt, because you get to determine the strike zone,\" Biden told Roberts. Biden first ran for president in 1988 but dropped out after charges of plagiarism in a stump speech. He also ran for the Oval Office this year but dropped out after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses. He's serving his sixth congressional term, making him Delaware's longest-serving senator. Biden's private battles, though, have shaped him more profoundly than his political skirmishes. He overcame a stuttering problem as a child. In 1988, he had surgery for a brain aneurysm. A Roman Catholic, Biden carries a rosary and kept one under his pillow during brain surgery, according to People magazine.  Watch Biden's sister describe how he fought his stuttering \u00bb . His most wrenching private struggle took place at the beginning of his political career in 1972. His first wife and infant daughter were killed in a car wreck. In an interview with CNN's Abbie Boudreau, Biden said he even considered quitting politics after the loss of his wife and daughter. Boudreau asked Biden to read a passage from his autobiography to explain how he moved on to marry his current spouse, Jill.  Watch Biden's emotional reading from his book \u00bb . The passage recounts a moment when he asked his current wife, Jill, how she could marry him when she knew he had adored his first wife. \"She didn't hesitate,\" Biden said, reading from his book. \"That's the reason I can marry you. Anybody that can love that deeply once can do it again.\" Biden swallowed hard, cleared his throat and looked down after he read that passage. Then he looked up again, his eyes welling with tears. He told Boudreau that his wife \"gave me permission to be me again.\" \"I know that sounds corny,\" Biden said. \"But she really did. ... She brought me back.\" Biden looked down again and said nothing more. For once, he was at a loss for words."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Joe Biden, a 'scrappy kid from Scranton', won a Senate seat at 29 and served six congressional terms.

But a team of scientists insist a Quorn-like product made from mealworm protein, tastes good and is a rich source of protein. The food, named C-fu, has primarily been designed to help feed the world\u2019s growing population, which is set to top nine billion by 2050, but its makers believe it could also catch on as a health food. A team of scientists have created a Quorn-like product made from mealworm protein (pictured in its raw form), which they say tastes good and is a rich source of protein, so it could be a hit with shoppers . Students from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and the Schulich School of Business, York University, Canada, created the 'bug meat,' composed of mealworms. They developed a technique to isolate the protein from worms and restructure it, to make more appetising C-fu cubes, which resemble blocks of tofu. It takes 10,000 mealworms to make one pound of C-fu, but the students say that the end product has more protein than tofu and is pound-for-pound more protein-rich than an egg. The food also contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are associated with lowering the risk of heart disease, making it a healthier alternative to meat. The food, named C-fu, shown here as a substitute for minced beef, has been designed to help feed the world\u2019s growing population, which is set to top nine billion by 2050 . It takes 10,000 mealworms (stock image) to make one pound of C-fu, but the students say that the end product has more protein than tofu and is pound-for-pound more protein rich than an egg . Scientists predict that the world\u2019s agricultural output needs to increase by 70 per cent to feed everyone in 2050. Farming insects is more environmentally friendly and less demanding than rearing cows, for example. One third of the global population, or two billion people, already eat insects as a regular part of their diet. Thailand, for example already has 20,000 small scale insect farms rearing over 7,500 tonnes of grasshoppers, crickets and other edible insects a year. Insects are nutritious because they are high in essential fatty acids, calcium, zinc, iron and B12. Gram for gram crickets, for example, have comparable levels of protein compared to beef half the calories and about 60 per cent less fat and fans of the food, describe the insects as \u2018nutty\u2019. The creators of C-fu claim it product has more protein than tofu and is pound-for-pound more protein rich than an egg. The food also contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are associated with lowering the risk of heart disease, making it a healthier alternative to meat. \u2018C-fu is dense nutrition that will help alleviate global hunger and nutrient deficiencies while providing livelihoods for microfarmers and processors,\u2019 the students wrote as part of their entry to the Thought For Food Challenge. Ten finalists were announced, which will compete for $10,000 (\u00a36,625) of seed funding to bring their hunger-beating products to market at a conference next month. Since September 2014, student teams from over 300 universities in 51 countries have been competing to develop concepts to alleviate hunger across the world. It\u2019s hoped that insect-based foods will play a key role, because they are easier and less energy-intensive to farm than livestock such as cows. Traditional meat production causes multiple sustainability issues, including large greenhouse gas emissions, while insects on the other hand, are very efficient consumers of resources. The team says that C-fu has less impact on the environment than meat, because insects use less land, consume less food and emit less greenhouse gases. It estimates that an area the size of Rhode Island \u2013 1,122 square miles (3,140 square km) used to farm mealworms, \u2013 would feed two billion people. The team hopes that its insect-sourced food will be acceptable to consumers because of its bland appearance and have shared recipes such as C-fu empanadas in blog posts. \u2018C-fu products will enter markets, groceries, and restaurants, increasing demand for insect foods and encouraging microfarmers worldwide,\u2019 they predict. \u2018Demand for insects as raw materials in new products will enable insect commodity markets to thrive and create a whole new food sector and jobs.\u2019 Scientists predict that the world\u2019s agricultural output needs to increase by 70 per cent to feed everyone in 2050.

More British restaurants and supermarkets are choosing to supply insects like crickets, grasshoppers and mealworms. They have been a traditional Mexican food since the time of the Aztecs and are consumed in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca, which was co-founded in 2007 by Masterchef winner Thomasina Miers, started to introduce the alternate protein source to diners in 2013. In January, it brought back chapulines fundido to the menu, made with one of Mexico's most sustainably farmed, yet unusual ingredients - grasshoppers. Chefs cook the fried chapulines (grashoppers) with softened shallots, garlic and smoky chipotle chillies to create a salsa, which is served with queso fundido, a mixture of grated mozzarella and cheddar cheese and a side of corn tortillas - and stocks are running low. Archipelago restaurant in Cleveland Street has love bug salads, bushmans's caviar (caramel mealworms, blinis, coconut cream and vodka jelly) and a dessert called Medieval Hive (brown butter ice-cream, honey and butter caramel sauce and a baby bee) on the menu.

March 22, 2014 was a day Arsene Wenger would never forget as he led out Arsenal for the 1000th time.

The probe\u00a0 is expected to take several months. HMS Bounty was originally built for the 1962 film 'Mutiny on the Bounty' starring Marlon Brando, and featured in several other films over the years, including one of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies. Mr Walbridge was captain of the three-masted tall ship, which sank about 90 miles off Cape Hatteras. Claudene Christian, 42, was among those rescued by coast guards, but she died. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the Walbridge and Christian families,' Capt Cameron said. The search persisted for days despite rough seas in the hope the expert seaman could stay alive in his survival suit in the relatively warm waters near the site of the shipwreck, the Coast Guard said. The water temperature was 79 degrees on Thursday. The original HMS Bounty became famous for a mutiny against its commander, William . Bligh, in April 1789. The mutiny was led by Fletcher Christian - an ancestor of . Claudene Christian. Mr Walbridge reportedly believed he could navigate the ship around Hurricane Sandy when the .

For two weeks, the holder of a half-dozen world records and the only person to walk on a wire over the brink of Niagara Falls, has . been practicing for what will be his biggest feat yet. The stunt by the seventh generation member of the famous Flying Wallenda acrobat family is scheduled to be . shown live on the Discovery Channel on June 23. Wallenda and his team have been trying to recreate the conditions he is likely to over the Grand Canyon.

Preparations: Nik Wallenda walks on a practice wire with the Grand Canyon as his back drop, as he trains for the stunt . Although the . humid Florida heat is helping him adjust to the temperatures he is expecting, the unpredictable winds that whip through the Grand Canyon have been challenging. To try to get a feel for dealing with them, Wallenda practiced walking on his wire cable as Tropical Storm Andrea battered the Gulf Coast. His team also used air boats to create winds reaching 91mph as Wallenda walked on his hire wire. 'I'm . not scared of them,' he told the Santa Cruz Sentinel, as he walked gracefully across his wire in the specially made moccasins his mother created for him. Top of the world: Nik Wallenda walks on top of the ferris wheel at Santa Cruz broadwalk in 2011 . Dream: The member of the Flying Wallenda act achieved his childhood wish of crossing Niagara Falls last year . Stunt: Nik Wallenda crosses a wire to entertain crowds at the Nascar spring cup series in North Carolina . 'I have to respect it, but I would never do what I do if I . was scared,' he said. Wallenda, who has dreamed of doing a wire walk across the Grand Canyon for years, says his act is made possible by good mental concentration and positive thinking. 'Once I get on that wire I get very peaceful ...\u00a0 I look down and look at my surroundings, I hear crowds, I hear people in the audience.' Since his first wire walk at the age of four, Wallenda he has been stung by a bee and had birds land on his balancing pole. His first experience on a wire came before he was even born, when his mother performed a sky walk while six months pregnant. In the final moments before starting one of his walks, he prays, then hugs his wife and three children, telling them he will see them in a few minutes. 'The first couple of steps are the hardest, so there's a lot of anticipation,' Wallenda, who proposed to his wife Erendira as they performed 30ft above crowds in Montreal, Canada, said. Legend: Karl Wallenda, Nik's great grandfather and source of inspiration, crosses the Tallulah Gorge in 1970 . Family act: Nik Wallenda and his sister Lijana learned to sky walk from a young age . He added: 'The hard part about doing live TV is waiting till the director says go.' The wire walker, who has written about his feats in his book Balance, uses a specially made cable, more often used for ocean dredging to perform his feats. His balance pole, which weights 43lb, is a vital piece of equipment, increasing his center of gravity and making it easier for him to adapt to conditions high above the ground. Despite his positive thinking and training however, Wallenda is well aware of the dangers of the stunt. His great-grandfather and legendary sky walker, Karl Wallenda, fell to his death at the age of 73, during a hire wire walk in Puerto Rico in 1978. The legendary sky walker has been a source of inspiration for\u00a0Wallenda, who recalls on his website watching footage of the tragedy when he was four. His grandfather's belief that 'Life is on the wire, everything else is just waiting,' has stayed with Wallenda since childhood, and driven him to perform his amazing hire wire feats. Focused: Nik Wallenda says when he steps on the wire he feels calm and relaxed - even over a 1,300ft drop . The televised sky walk over Niagara last year was watched by more than 13 million Americans on ABC. However, the safety clause in the network's contract meant Wallenda had to wear a harness. 'It was my dream to walk over Niagara Falls since I was about 5 or 6 years old, but part of that dream was taken away because I had to wear that harness,' he said. 'The exciting thing about this event is that I will not be wearing any tether or any safety whatsoever.'

It does, after all, have two suns. OK, so a long weekend visiting a planet 1,200 trillion miles away, may not be a realistic prospect just yet, but that hasn't stopped scientists at NASA from dreaming. To mark the exciting discovery of a slew of potentially distant habitable worlds by its Kepler space observatory, the U.S. space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology has created a series of posters advertising imaginary vacations to some of them. Rendered in the retro style of classic travel billboards of the 1920s, '30s and '40s, the posters depict these distant worlds as pleasurable destinations. The image for Kepler 16-b -- previously compared to the fictional \"Star Wars\" planet of Tatooine because of its dual suns -- shows a space-suited figure basking in the light from the twin orbs overhead. \"Relax on Kepler 16-b,\" the poster says. \"The land of two suns ... Where your shadow always has company.\" Although the planet is depicted as a rocky, terrestrial world, NASA says it could also be a gas giant like Saturn with freezing temperatures that would make it hostile to known lifeforms. A second poster shows an astronaut free-falling to experience the powerful gravity over HD 40307g, a \"Super Earth\" 44 light years -- or 264 trillion miles -- away. The third depicts Kepler-186f (even further away at 500 light years) with a scene of red trees held back by a white picket fence. The planet has been previously described as \"Earth's cousin\" because it's similar in size to our own world. Because it orbits a cooler, redder sun there's speculation that if plants did grow here, they'd be a different color to our own vegetation. Where the grass is redder . \"Kepler-186f, where the grass is always redder on the other side,\" the poster's slogan reads. The posters, available to download for free via JPL's website, are the work of the space agency's visual strategists Joby Harris, David Delgado and Dan Goods, who were inspired by the new discoveries being made by Kepler. \"I  was thinking ... we may be not alone,\" Delgado tells CNN. \"We're entering a new part of our humanity and one of the natural things that came to mind is what would it be like to visit them ... and wouldn't it be fun to make vacation posters. \"It felt like a natural fit.\" Harris, the lead artist, was inspired by the enduring appeal of vintage art deco-style posters. \"I remember sitting in meetings with the scientists thinking 'oh my goodness, science fiction is now becoming science non-fiction',\" he says. \"People gravitate toward those old posters. They hang them on their walls even today and you want to go there. They're a celebration of place. \"So we thought we'd produce some of our own and come up with funny tag lines that would get people dreaming about what it would be like to go there.\" The three posters were released just as NASA announced Kepler's latest discoveries, bringing its planetary tally to more than 1,000 alien worlds since its launch in 2009. According to Delgado, three more posters are in the works, but progress is slow because the theories about what these newly found planets look like can change from day to day. Still, as he points out, the NASA team might not be the only artists at work. \"Maybe on one of these other planets, they're making posters about visiting here.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has designed posters advertising imaginary vacations to distant habitable worlds discovered by the Kepler space observatory.

With shops starting their sales earlier every year, the British retail ritual on December 26 is coming to 'the end of its life cycle'. Footfall on Boxing Day fell by four per cent between 2011 and 2013 as people found themselves shopped out by the time the customary sales began. Scroll down for video . Shoppers beg sales assistants for products in Selfridges on Boxing Day last year - but scenes like this could become a thing of the past following a rise in pre-Christmas discounts . The growing success of US imports such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday could further diminish the popularity of this year's Boxing Day sales . The Boxing Day shopping stampede could become extinct as there are now bargains available pre-Christmas . Retail analyst Springboard said there has been a huge shift in shopping patterns, with many people snapping up discount electrical items and clothing throughout December instead. The growing success of US imports such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday could further diminish the popularity of this year's Boxing Day sales. The demise of the Boxing Day stampede began during the recession, as shoppers spent less or delayed buying expensive items until the sales started. This prompted retailers to bring their sales forward to encourage spending and, ever since, shops have competed to be the first shop to drop its prices. Three-quarters of the top 100 high street shops have already started their sales in a bid to attract customers, with discounts averaging 45 per cent, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. Marks & Spencer is already offering 30 per cent off knitwear, 20 per cent off bags and 20 per cent off hats, scarves and gloves, while Debenhams is offering up to half price off everything from boots and coats to dinnerware and watches. John Lewis, Ted Baker and Next appeared to be some of the few stores holding their nerve until after Christmas. Diane Wehrle, at Springboard, said: 'The special nature of Boxing Day is diminishing. It is possibly coming to the end of its life cycle. 'Culturally in Britain, Boxing Day is still a day when people shop, while Black Friday is a relatively new import from the US. 'But Boxing Day is no longer what it used to be, partly because the sales are starting before Christmas, so there is less impetus to rush out to the shops after Christmas, and partly because of the growth of online shopping.' She said high street retailers needed to adapt and give families a reason to venture out on Boxing Day, including putting on entertainment. She said: 'They need to make it an event again so that people want to go to 'experience' the sales. 'They could have entertainers or demonstrations or celebrities to attract people in.' The demise of the Boxing Day stampede began during the recession, as shoppers spent less or delayed buying expensive items until the sales started . The mad scramble for cut-price goods on Boxing Day, such as this scene in Selfridges, could become extinct . Only a few years ago, pre-Christmas sales were rare, with retailers able to charge full price for festive outfits and gifts . The rise in online shopping also means that many people spend their Christmas money and gift vouchers on December 25 itself, using their phones and computer tablets to do so. Amazon has predicted this will be its busiest Christmas on record, with sales peaking at 12.26pm and again at 9.02pm, as families download films, music and books on their Kindles and tablets. This new trend also eats into Boxing Day revenues, with many consumers felling they have 'spent up' by the time they fall asleep in Christmas Day. Only a few years ago, pre-Christmas sales were rare, with retailers able to charge full price for festive outfits and gifts. But retailers were forced to slash their prices in the aftermath of the economic crisis to lure shoppers back on to the High Street. Now, customers expect these sales every December. Accounting company BDO claims that 'consumers have become conditioned towards waiting for promotions before making purchases'. Millions of Britons will hit the high street on Tuesday in a last-minute rush, on what is expected to be the busiest shopping day of the year . The busiest hour on Tuesday will apparently fall between 1pm and 2pm, with an estimated \u00a31.3bn set to be spent using its cards on the high street . The December sales have also encouraged people to put off their Christmas shopping, rather than stockpiling in November. It means millions of Britons will hit the high street on Tuesday in a last-minute rush, on what is expected to be the busiest shopping day of the year. The busiest hour will apparently fall between 1pm and 2pm, according to credit card provider Visa, with an estimated \u00a31.3bn set to be spent using its cards on the high street. For those wishing to avoid the crowds, brave shoppers could delay until the quietest hour of the week on the high street \u2013 3pm on Christmas Eve. While expensive iPads, Kindles and games consoles have featured among the best-selling items this year, traditional wooden toys and games have also made a comeback. John Lewis said sales of backgammon boards were up 100 per cent on the same week last year, while its \u00a3100 doll's house has completely sold out. Waitrose also reported a 'real trend for nostalgia' as sales of frozen puddings rose by almost two-thirds. A frozen pudding by Michelin-starred chef Heston Blumenthal, called the Ultimate Chocolate Bar, is among the supermarket's bestsellers. Based on one of Blumenthal's childhood favourites, it contains caramel mousse, an almond and hazelnut mousse, crunchy chocolate biscuit and a caramel ganache.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\n(CNN) -- Words like \"landmark\" and \"historic\" are being used to describe this week's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit. More than 40 heads of state, the President, dozens of American CEOs, celebrities, activists and several members of Congress -- myself included -- are participating in the three-day event. Every issue affecting the continent, from combating wildlife trafficking to food security, is on the agenda. Yet, of the 53 hours of official meetings scheduled for the summit, only two are dedicated to the critical issue of governance. That is scant treatment for what is perhaps the greatest impediment to security and economic growth in Africa. It also sends the wrong message about our shared priorities and values. In Africa, electing fresh, new leaders is not something people do often. Consider this: The 10 current longest-serving African leaders have held their offices for a total of 252 years. Three of these leaders (Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea, and Omar el-Bashir of Sudan) have not been invited to the summit because they are in poor standing with the United States. Of those receiving an invite, Rwanda's Paul Kagame and Uganda's Yoweri Museveni were unwisely hailed as \"new African leaders\" during the Clinton administration, while others came to power when Jimmy Carter was in the Oval Office. Needless to say, presidents serving in their 25th year generally don't promote free and fair elections and good governance. Elections are a pillar of democracy and good governance. When conducted freely, fairly and regularly, they give citizens their most effective tool for holding their leaders accountable and pressing policy makers for action and reform. In fact, the World Bank has shown that political competition, primarily through elections, is associated with improvements to a country's business environment. Not only do elections bolster economies, they can improve security. Take, for example, Liberia. Decades of protracted conflict and a deadly civil war resulted from corruption and massive human rights abuses by war criminal Charles Taylor, along with the political exclusion of whole swaths of the country's populace. But inclusive and democratic elections in 2006 brought to power Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first elected female head of state. Now, Liberia is experiencing a much-needed period of political reconciliation and improved security. While Liberians certainly still face a number of challenges -- including the recent Ebola outbreak -- inclusive elections have proven to be a stabilizing force in West Africa. Despite the overstay of too many African leaders, there are reasons for hope. Eleven African countries are planning to hold elections next year, and 15 more countries have an election scheduled for 2016. In the next two years, more than half the leaders in sub-Saharan Africa are slated to stand for re-election. Each election day in these countries over the next two years will be a defining moment for the future of governance across the continent. 5 reasons Obama's Africa leaders' summit matters . The United States cannot be absent during this critical transition. We should support programs that improve the transparency of elections and encourage the peaceful transfer of power, which, unfortunately, far too many Africans have yet to see. Most importantly, the United States should push back on those leaders who seek to amend their constitutions to create imperial, indefinite presidencies. Two leaders most recently accused of seeking such constitutional changes -- Joseph Kabila of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Blaise Compaore of Burkina Faso -- are in town for the Summit. Allowing them to return home without pressing for free, fair and regular elections would be an affront to the citizens of these two countries. Opinion: Africa and U.S.: Invest in human rights . President Obama once pressed for good governance aggressively. In 2009, when he traveled to Ghana and addressed that country's parliament, he took a \"no excuses\" approach toward African leaders. In an interview just before landing on the continent, the President noted that, \"I'm a big believer that Africans are responsible for Africa ... for many years we've made excuses about corruption or poor governance; that this was somehow the consequence of neo-colonialism, or the West has been oppressive, or racism. I'm not a believer in excuses. ... I think that it's very important for African leadership to take responsibility and be held accountable.\" Nice words, unfortunately undermined by a summit agenda that shorts good governance.

According to published reports, since January, several CIA operatives involved in the missions in Libya have been forced to submit to multiple polygraph tests - in some cases, operatives were given a test on a monthly basis. According to sources with direct knowledge of the situation, the agency is questioning operatives to find out whether they are talking about Benghazi with the media or with members of Congress, which just demanded that an investigation into the terrorist attack be a priority of the FBI's new director, James Comey. What Happened? Nobody seems to know exactly what happened during the Benghazi attack - and the CIA seems to want to keep it that way . According to CNN - which broke the story about the number of operatives on the ground the night of the attack, and the CIA's frequent use of polygraphs - a CNN operative who passes information on to Congress or the media faces career-ending consequences. One of CNN's sources described the CIA's attempts to keep elements of the Benghazi attack as 'unprecendented.' 'You have no idea the amount of pressure being brought to bear on anyone with knowledge of this operation,' one source said. Another source described the CIA's tactics as 'pure intimidation.' In internal communications obtained by the network, one insider writes, 'You don't jeopardize yourself, you jeopardize your family as well.' Tragedy: U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed in the terrorist attack on the embassy in Benghazi . Terror: The Obama Administration refused to call the Benghazi attack 'terror' for several weeks after the assault . According to former CIA operative and CNN analyst Robert Baer, agents are generally questioned once every three to four years, 'never more than that.' 'If somebody is being polygraphed every month, or every two months it's . called an issue polygraph, and that means that the polygraph division . suspects something, or they're looking for something, or they're on a . fishing expedition. But it's absolutely not routine at all to be . polygraphed monthly, or bi-monthly,' Baer continued. The CIA denies that it is trying to keep things from Congress. In a statement, CIA spokesman Dean Boyd insists that the agency has 'worked closely with its oversight committees to provide them with an . extraordinary amount of information related to the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi.' 'CIA employees are always free to speak to Congress if they want,' the . statement continued. 'The CIA enabled all officers involved in Benghazi . the opportunity to meet with Congress. We are not aware of any CIA . employee who has experienced retaliation, including any non-routine . security procedures, or who has been prevented from sharing a concern . with Congress about the Benghazi incident.' According to one CNN source, there were as many as 35 CIA operatives on the ground in Benghazi on the night of the attack, with up to seven wounded, in some cases seriously. At least 21 were in the building known as the Annex. Foreign Serviceman Sean Smith also was killed during the attack . The actual number of operatives in Benghazi that night remains a mystery, though, as well as what - exactly - they were doing there. 'We should have the people who were on the scene come in, testify under . oath, do it publicly, and lay it out. And there really isn't any . national security issue involved with regards to that,' Congressman Frank Wolf - who has been seeking answers about what happened in Benghazi for over a year.

Answers: Congressman Frank Wolf wants people on the ground the night of the attack to testify under oath before Congress . Wolf also says that in the immediate aftermath of the attack, there were several people with close ties to CIA operatives and contractors who contacted him wanting to talk. Now, he said, there is silence. 'Initially they were not afraid to come forward.

Leaked emails sent by the party\u2019s Whips\u2019 Office show that in the 54 days since MP Mark Reckless\u2019s defection to Ukip, there were around 100 separate visits to the constituency by Cabinet ministers, including five by the Prime Minister. Some 246 Conservative MPs \u2013 80 per cent of the total \u2013 hit the campaign trail, with so many there that they were asked to sit in offices stuffing envelopes rather than knocking doors, amid reports voters were sick and tired of constant canvassing. Scroll down for video . On October 16, David Cameron introduced the Conservative Party's candidates Anna Firth and Kelly Tolhurst at the Wainscott Memorial Hall in Rochester . On October 24, Mr Cameron attended a community forum in Chatham, Kent, as he campaigns for the Conservative party in the Rochester and Strood by-election with candidate Kelly Tolhurst (second right) In the early days of the campaign, David Cameron was quoted as saying privately he wanted to kick Mr Reckless\u2019s \u2018fat a*** out of the Commons\u2019 and insisting he would \u2018throw the kitchen sink\u2019 at winning the seat. Ukip\u2019s triumph \u2013 its second by-election win in weeks \u2013 shook all three main parties. Nigel Farage declared there were now no no-go areas for his party and neither the Conservatives nor Labour could hope to win next year\u2019s General Election outright. But Tory jitters were limited by the smaller-than-expected majority, with senior Eurosceptics, including John Redwood and John Baron, speaking supportively. Ukip had forecast a win by 15 percentage points or more just days ago, but Mr Reckless won by 2,900 votes, or just 7 points. \u2018It isn\u2019t big enough,\u2019 said one MP sceptical about the party leadership of Mr Reckless\u2019s majority. \u2018If you\u2019re an MP flirting with defection and you look at those numbers in a by-election when people want to kick the Government, you have to be thinking you wouldn\u2019t hold on to your seat at the General Election.\u2019 On November 4, Mr Cameron (centre) with Kelly Tolhurst (left), the new Conservative candidate for Rochester and Strood, were shown around the Crossrail site in Chatham, Kent . On November 11, Mr Cameron spoke to pupils of Strood Academy in Rochester, Kent . And on November 18, Mr Cameron and Ms Tolhurst, visited a company in  Rochester . Mr Cameron said: \u2018I\u2019m absolutely determined to win this seat back at the next General Election. Because anything other than a Conservative government will put our recovery at risk and mean Ed Miliband in Downing Street.\u2019 Bookmakers have installed the Conservatives as favourites to retake the seat in May\u2019s election. Emails prepared by the Whips\u2019 Office show that at least 100 visits were made to Rochester by Cabinet ministers, with each member asked to go five times, and MPs to make three visits at their own expense. The emails reveal that 246 MPs made at least one visit, and most had made several. Mr Cameron said he would \u2018lead from the front\u2019 by doing the same, but his final two visits to local businesses, as Ukip surged in the polls, were notably low-key. Ukip and Labour believe the Tories must also have come close to the spending limit for a by-election \u2013 of \u00a3100,000 \u2013 after holding an expensive open primary vote of residents to choose their candidate. The party also hired no fewer than four shops in the constituency to act as bases. Every Saturday, buses full of young activists \u2013 so-called Team 2015, who were used to great effect in the Newark by-election the Tories won earlier this year \u2013 arrived to pound the streets. One minister was quoted at the start of the campaign as saying it would be \u2018like Newark on crack cocaine\u2019. The Tories\u2019 operation to try to secure the seat for their candidate, marine surveyor Kelly Tolhurst, reached fever pitch on polling day as hundreds of activists, including MPs, went canvassing. Miss Tolhurst had used a public meeting to appeal to voters from the Labour, Lib Dems and Greens to vote tactically for the Tories in order to keep Ukip out. And on the final day, thousands of glossy personalised leaflets \u2013 bearing the name of each voter \u2013 were sent to likely Tory voters, encouraging them to go to the polls. One MP, who is on the Right of the party, said they and several colleagues were \u2018incandescent\u2019 about a letter Miss Tolhurst sent to voters, approved by Tory HQ. Despite not once mentioning she was a Conservative, it mentioned Ukip twice. It also mentioned \u2018uncontrolled immigration\u2019 and the fact some local people felt unsafe on their high street due to crime, in a way that critics said made it appear the issues were linked. Miss Tolhurst denied she had intended a link. The MP said: \u2018A lot of us thought it was deeply unpleasant.\u2019 Patrick Brione, director of research at pollster Survation, said: \u2018All MPs were instructed to visit the constituency at least three times and over a hundred MPs did so on multiple occasions; David Cameron himself made five visits. The party had shipped in activists from across the country to bombard the constituency with canvassing \u2013 their resources extended as far as being able to pull off a logistically impressive 6am mail drop to households across the seat on the morning of the vote. \u2018Despite all of this, the party failed to retain a seat with a 10,000-vote majority, against an opposition party which had not even fielded a candidate at the previous election. The implications for the Conservatives are potentially dire.\u2019 Michael Gove accused Mair of playing a game of 'political snakes and ladders' on Radio 4 . Michael Gove today accused the BBC of \u2018political game-playing\u2019 after he was repeatedly asked about the Prime Minister\u2019s failure at the ballot box. In a hostile exchange on Radio 4\u2019s PM, the Chief Whip told presenter Eddie Mair he was playing a game of \u2018political snakes and ladders\u2019 rather than asking about issues of substance. After Mr Mair accused Mr Gove of dodging a question about whether he should resign if there are more defections to Ukip, the former education secretary seemed to become frustrated. \u2018Your question was, if I may say so, the type of political game-playing that puts people off BBC interviewers because of instead of asking about policy you\u2019re asking about position,\u2019 he told Mr Mair. \u2018One of the things people dislike about politics is the way that commentators instead of talking about issues of substance, such as employment or inflation, play a game of snakes and ladders, and who is up and who is down.\u2019 Mr Gove said the Conservatives were on course for victory in May\u2019s general election despite suffering a second drubbing at the ballot box in just six weeks. When repeatedly pressed to explain why Mr Cameron \u2018can\u2019t win\u2019, Mr Gove insisted he \u2018secured a bigger swing than any leader since 1930s\u2019 at the last general election and is \u2018winning the economic argument\u2019. He added that \u2018there is no one to match David Cameron in terms of the strengths of leadership\u2019 among current politicians. Asked if he would resign as Chief Whip if another Tory defects to Ukip, he told the programme: \u2018I\u2019m convinced that nobody will so the matter doesn\u2019t arise.\u2019 Mr Gove has previously said that there are not too many immigrants in Britain \u2013 a key Ukip claim \u2013 but he refused to repeat the comments in an interview with Channel 4 News last night. Queue of others waiting to defect gloats Farage . Nigel Farage today predicted that more MPs would defect to Ukip next year. Arch Conservative eurosceptic Philip Hollobone flanked Tory defector Mark Reckless as he was sworn in as Ukip\u2019s second MP, raising speculation he may be next to jump ship. Ukip leader Mr Farage suggested Tory MPs facing a threat from Labour in northern constituencies would be the most likely to see their future in his party, and mentioned a list of five of the most likely. Some have \u2018no chance of winning on a blue rosette but might do on a purple rosette\u2019 at the general election, he said. Asked who he was thinking of, he gave no names but referred to a list drawn up by academic Matthew Goodwin of the five most likely Tories to defect to cling on to their seats. Winner and loser: Ukip leaderNigel Farage, right, and Prime Minister David Cameron, left, today . It includes Chris Kelly, MP for Dudley South, who is already quitting in May, David Nuttall in Bury North, Martin Vickers in Cleethorpes and Nigel Mills in the Amber Valley. All have denied they will defect. The fifth, Basildon and Billericay MP John Baron, said recently that \u2018you should never say never in politics\u2019. Another who has denied he will defect is Adam Holloway, Tory MP for Gravesham in Kent, who Mr Farage said he had spoken to but would not say when, or what they discussed. Mr Farage did not expect more MPs to join Ukip straightaway, but expected some to reach a decision over Christmas. He said: \u2018I would be very surprised if there weren\u2019t defections of MPs between now and the general election.\u2019 He had spoken to Labour figures, but they were more scared of a voter backlash."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ukip's victory in the Rochester and Strood by-election was by a smaller-than-expected majority, despite the Tories' extensive campaign, including an expensive open primary vote.

Called the SeaOrbiter, the part submarine, part research vessel is the concept of French architect Jacques Rougerie. Currently the centerpiece of France's pavilion at Expo 2012 in Yeosu, South Korea, it has spent almost 12 years floating around as a mere concept. It recently completed its industrial design phase and construction is slated for October this year. \"All technical issues are resolved, all the modeling is done,\" says Ariel Fuchs, education and media director of the SeaOrbiter project. \"We gathered institutional and industrial support five or six years ago and it's been a real institutional and financial project for the last two years.\" It is expected to cost around $43 million and when built, will be 58-meters in height, taller than Nelson's Column, a monument in London. When launched, around 50% of the vessel will be below the water line, allowing for constant underwater study, Fuchs says. \"One of the first users will be the science community,\" he says. \"It's designed to explore the ocean in a new way, mainly spending time under the sea, giving people the opportunity to live under the sea for a very long time, to observe, to undertake research missions, like marine biology, oceanography and climate issues.\" Rougerie's inspiration for SeaOrbiter comes from ocean explorers like Jacques Cousteau and the experimental Tektite underwater capsule laboratory that was used by oceanographer Sylvia Earle in 1969. Earle is one of many vocal supporters of the SeaOrbiter project; others include former NASA Administrator Dan Goldin and astronaut Jean-Loup Chretien. The space connection doesn't stop there as SeaOrbiter has enlisted the support of the European Space Agency and other industrial organizations to help develop the technology needed for the ambitious project and its onboard systems. Designed to drift with ocean currents, the vessel will generate the majority of its power for life-support systems and propulsion to avoid other ships and storms from renewable energy, including solar, wind and wave power, Fuchs says. A side project is underway in conjunction with EADS, the European defense and space systems conglomerate, to develop a biofuel as the ship's main power source. \"It meets the requirements of today's philosophy of sustainability,\" Fuchs says. When built, the ship is expected to go to Monaco -- the same place where Jacques Cousteau began his missions. \"The larger education plan is explaining how important the oceans are in to the balance of the planet,\" says Fuchs."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jacques Rougerie's SeaOrbiter, a 58-meter tall vessel, is set for construction in October.

Two jumbo jets with 1,000 people aboard were just 100ft from crashing over Scotland because all four pilots turned the planes onto a collision course after failing to follow instructions. The transatlantic Boeing 747s were gradually converging on each other side-by-side for ten miles as the crews prepared for their ocean crossings. An air traffic controller who spotted the danger immediately ordered the plane on the left to make a left turn and the one on the right to make a right turn, to move them further apart. But they did the opposite - bringing the two massive aircraft closer together. The two transatlantic Boeing 747s gradually converging on each other side-by-side near Glasgow . Mid-air drama: This diagram shows how the two jets headed towards eachother and at crisis point were around 100ft apart . A tragedy was averted with just seconds to spare when the pilots - two on each aircraft - physically saw each other and took evasive action, with one plane climbing and the other diving. At one point they were only 100ft apart vertically. When the alarm was first sounded the jets were about ten miles apart. Within a minute, they were less than three miles apart horizontally and closing.

'The board was surprised that all four pilots had misheard or misinterpreted the avoiding action instructions despite at least one of the crews reading them back correctly,' said the report. They could not have confused their callsigns as they were not similar, and the radio transmissions were clear. The report said the crews may have been distracted as they received clearances to cross the ocean and settled into their transatlantic routine, and were caught off guard by the alert. 'Expecting only routine information to be transmitted at that time, they may have been perplexed by the avoiding action information and instinctively responded without properly assimilating it,' it said.

A lot. \"Glitch after glitch marred Airtime's first public showing, leaving the event's collection of celebrities riffing and improvising onstage while engineers tried to fix the bugs and revive dropped connections,\" CNNMoney's Laurie Segall wrote from the event. \"Airtime demo = Snoop, Jim Carrey, Ed Helms, Julia Louis Dreyfus, Joel McHale, Alicia Keys, Olivia Munn + a million tech problems,\" tweeted Abby Gardner, from Marie Claire. \"The Airtime has been about 80% fail, but, hey, Jim Carrey is here. So it's all good,\" wrote Mashable's editor-in-chief, Lance Ulanoff. CNET was harsher: \"To launch his new start-up, Sean Parker should have spent less of his billions on celebrity guests and more of it on fixing his technology,\" wrote Greg Sandoval. A botched demonstration, of course, doesn't mean that Airtime is doomed. But, based on reviews from tech writers, descriptions of the product and a quick test, there's something more troubling that could be bad news for Airtime's shelf life: . No one seems to know why people would use it. How Airtime works . Essentially, Airtime is a Facebook-connected, video-chatting platform on crack. When you log on at Airtime.com you see two video-chat windows, a list of your friends you might want to talk with and a list of topics you might want to talk about. If you select a topic -- like TV's \"Mad Men\" or other items you may have \"liked\" on Facebook -- you will get set up with a video chat with someone else who also likes that show. The same goes for location: You can have Airtime start a random conversation with someone who is on Facebook and who lives in your geographic area. It's like Skype, but you can watch YouTube clips with someone while you're engaged in a video chat together. Which makes it like Google+, except it's attached to a social network that has 900 million active users, giving it potentially more reach. If you're plugged into the tech world, you may recall a website called Chatroulette, which hooked people up with strangers online for quick, random video chats. That site got lots of buzz on this website and others, but it ultimately flopped because people stopped using it for cross-cultural \"We Are the World\" exchanges, and started getting naked. Because Airtime also lets people chat with strangers, it's been called the logical, safer successor to Chatroulette -- one with more clothes. Parker's chat program is tied to Facebook, so it knows your real identity and can ban you in a hurry if you show up for a video discussion sans pants. According to this Forbes report, the site will snap photos of users periodically to ensure that people have their clothes on. So that's how it works. But the question remains: Do Internet users really want to chat with strangers? And if not, is Airtime different enough from Skype -- a video-chat program that's already integrated into Facebook -- to stand out? Serendipity, or sleaze? Writing at the blog All Things D, Liz Gannes explains why the Napster alums think people will want to engage in video chats with people they don't know: . \"Parker and Fanning argue that they are helping bring serendipity into a world where people's online social graphs are set. Airtime is a 'social discovery' application for helping people make new friends online, not necessarily for the purpose of dating.\" But, she writes, it's not certain if that's how people will use the network. \"It's unclear if Airtime will work -- will people want to use it?\" she asks. \"Will it fill up with spammers and skeezy dudes? Is it technically sound? But what is clear is that there are high expectations for Parker and Fanning's next act.\" Sandoval, from CNET, was more direct: \"Cool technology or not, the demand for this kind of service has yet to emerge,\" he wrote. Others are more upbeat about the future of random video chats. \"The excitement of meeting new people with whom you have no 'friends' in common, only interests, geography or kinks, are probably enough (to propel the product),\" Anthony Wing Kosner wrote at Forbes.com. \"Parker told (Forbes writer Steven) Bertoni in an interview Sunday, 'Fun crazy things should happen online.' OK. Let the wild rumpus begin! (Once the technical glitches are worked out...)\" Wired, meanwhile, also sees potential in random video conferences between strangers, particularly because Airtime works to set you up with people who have common interests: . \"When a chat with a stranger is initiated, the service lists both users' shared interests. So, for example, if both users are huge 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' fans, they could both dive right into discussing the pros and cons of William Riker's beard. Interests can be added and removed from within the video chat window. This is perfect if your love of 'Twin Peaks' has connected you with people who are probably a little too obsessed with the death of Laura Palmer.\" The blog TechCrunch goes so far as to say the program will \"re-humanize the Internet.\" \"One minute into using Airtime I was laughing with someone I'd never met,\" writes Josh Constine. \"That's something special when despite all the asynchronous connection, the Internet threatens to make us feel lonely.\" My time with Airtime . In my quick test of the network, I had a different experience. Whereas Chatroulette in its early, non-pornographic days felt fun and random, Airtime felt more stilted. It was almost intimidating to enter into chats on Airtime with strangers who were assumed to have something in common with you. That said, I did have a couple of good interactions. I talked to one guy about the E3 video-gaming conference going on this week. He seemed impressed with Airtime and said it is way better than Chatroulette. But I also chatted with someone who was supposed to be in my geographic area and wasn't. We didn't have much to talk about, so I started playing that mash-up YouTube video of Barack Obama singing \"Call Me Maybe.\" The point, I'd hoped, was that this might give us something to talk about -- or at least we could sway together. Not so much. My 30-second friend hung up on me.

Actor Rodger Corser plays \"Guitar Hero\" at an April event in Australia. The game has revived interest in rock music. Ulrich may have played songs from those old rock bands around the house on his stereo, but he gives credit for his son's excitement to another source: video games. Myles Ulrich is a fan of games such as \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band,\" which have spawned a comeback for rock music. \"It's a cool generational thing to share that with your kids,\" said Ulrich, the drummer for the multi-platinum quartet. \"My [son's] favorite bands are ... the same bands that are my favorite bands -- the bands I grew up on.\" A few years ago, rock music was struggling on the charts. With hip-hop and teen pop ruling, rock was finding it hard to break through with new music -- or sell more of the old. But \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" have prompted kids born in the '90s to discover artists from the '70s and '80s such as Aerosmith, Twisted Sister and Pat Benatar. The games' amazing popularity -- last year, the two brought in more than $935 million in revenue, according to the NPD Group market research company -- has helped create success in other markets, according to observers.  Watch Ulrich and others praise the games on \"American Morning\" \u00bb . Geoff Mayfield, senior analyst and director of charts for Billboard magazine, said he sees a direct cause-and-effect for some of the artists who have licensed their songs to \"Guitar Hero.\" \"A few weeks ago, when the game featuring Aerosmith ['Guitar Hero: Aerosmith'] came out, there was more than a 40 percent increase in their catalog sales. I expect you'll see that again when Metallica gets the same kind of treatment in a few weeks,\" Mayfield said. iReport.com: Do you shred on \"Guitar Hero?\" Once wary of downloading, Metallica has changed its tune with its upcoming album. \"When 'Death Magnetic' comes out in September, you can actually download the new album the same day it comes out, and play it on your 'Guitar Hero III,' \" Ulrich said -- fully aware of the irony, given his band's past litigation with the Internet music file-sharing service Napster. Even in an uncertain economy, the video games also have increased interest in guitars, according to the nationwide Guitar Center chain. And bars holding \"Guitar Hero\" nights also have enjoyed a boost in business: Big Wangs sports tavern in Hollywood, California, reports a 25 percent to 35 percent increase in sales. The results have played out at such places as Roosevelt High School in Los Angeles, where most teens have grown up on a steady diet of hip-hop and R&B. Recently, heavy metal blared from the school's darkened auditorium as it sponsored a three-day \"Guitar Hero Face-Off.\" Spotlights illuminated the competitors, and an audience full of enthusiasts screamed wildly at the end of each song. It was enough to make 16-year-old finalist George Gomez nervous. \"You got fans cheering you on,\" he marveled shyly. For Mayfield, the marriage of music and video games makes perfect sense, especially for an ailing record industry that's been having trouble selling CDs. \"This is a chance for something that's been a competition to actually be an ally, if you will,\" he said. Mayfield has never played \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Rock Band,\" but he said he understands the irresistible appeal of kids and adults indulging in some harmless headbanging -- albeit with toy instruments. \"If you've ever played air guitar, more than likely, you weren't doing it to a Michael Jackson song. You were doing it to an Aerosmith song,\" he said.

Investigators now believe up to 23 babies were fed using the tainted batch at 11 intensive care units across England. Three have died. Tragic: A third baby has died after being given a contaminated batch of drip feed which affected 23 newborns. The latest death was at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge, on the same site as Addenbrooke's (pictured) The baby was fed using the tainted drip on May 27, the same day authorities believe it was delivered by London pharmaceutical firm ITH Pharma.

'However, recent microbiological tests have shown the presence of the outbreak strain.' Produced by London pharmaceutical firm ITH Pharma, TPN is designed to feed babies born prematurely who are too weak to eat on their own. The most recent victim of the tainted batch, who has not been named, fell ill several weeks ago at the Rosie, which is on the same site as Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital and run by the same health trust. A spokesman for the trust said: 'Our . thoughts are with the family and we are supporting them during this very . difficult and emotional time. 'A consultant neonatologist has spoken to all of the families on the unit. 'The . babies on the unit have been closely monitored for any signs of . infection since we withdraw the contaminated feed.

Investigators have almost finished their inquiry and believe the contamination was an 'isolated incident'. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is used to slowly drip-feed patients who are too weak to eat. It is not just used for babies - patients commonly receive it directly into their bloodstream for 10 or 12 hours at a time. It is believed the contaminated batch contained the bacteria Bacillus cereus. The bacteria are often found in cooked foods like rice and soups which have been left at room temperature for too long. They produce toxins which cause diahorrhea, stomach cramps and vomiting when eaten. But because the toxins were injected directly into the bloodstream and the patients were babies with a poor immune system, they would have had a more serious effect. How the bacteria could have ended up inside a medical drip is still being investigated. Professor . Mike Catchpole, incident director at Public Health England, said: 'The main findings . have all pointed towards there being a single incident that occurred on . one day.

That ban will be challenged for the first time in court Wednesday -- and activists, as well as artists, some of whose careers were launched on YouTube, are keeping their fingers crossed. Rapper, singer and songwriter Adil Omar is a musician that has relied on social networking sites to launch his career. Even without a record label, he successfully used YouTube to reach both a domestic and international audience -- collaborating with international artists like Cypress Hill, Everlast, Xzibit and guitarist Slash from Guns 'N Roses.

But soon after the YouTube ban, response to his album plummeted. \"I'm getting about a tenth of the promotion I was getting before and I have about a tenth of the sales I was initially getting,\" he said. Numbers on YouTube reflect his comment. Omar's last major single \"Paki Rambo,\" released before the YouTube ban, generated more than 320,000 hits. One of his first singles after the ban got just over 30,000 clicks. Protests erupted across the Arab world last year when trailers for \"Innocence of Muslims,\" an anti-Islam film that mocks the prophet Mohammed, appeared online. YouTube is not the only social media website that was taken away from Pakistani Web users. Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr all have been banned in the past. The recent ban on YouTube, however, is the longest-running act of online censorship in Pakistan's history. Bytes for All, an organization that fights for digital rights in Pakistan, has worked to lift this censorship -- running a poster campaign, filing petitions and writing to the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression. \"We do not need dictatorial nannies to tell people what to watch and what not to watch and what decision to take and how to take it. Because after all, it's a democracy. It's not a dictatorship anymore,\" said Furhan Hussain from Bytes for All. The ban on YouTube \"is in direct violation of the constitution of Pakistan. It violates the fundamental human rights of freedom of expression and freedom of access to information of the citizens of Pakistan,\" he said. CNN reached out for comment repeatedly to Pakistan's minister of information technology but got no response. Omar, like the activists from Bytes for All, hopes the ban will be lifted soon. \"What I'd like to see happen is for YouTube to open up again.

Butterfly Boucher relies on encouragement from fans to fuel her determination. Really. \"It's my real name,\" the singer-songwriter said. \"It's on my passport and everything. The first question [people usually ask] is, 'Is that your real name?' The second question is, 'Were your parents hippies?' \" Well? \"They were kind of hippies. They were just very creative types.\" Born in Adelaide, Australia, Butterfly Boucher (rhymes with \"voucher\") is the middle of seven sisters and spent much of her childhood moving cities with her family in a motor home. And yes, some of her siblings have equally free-spirited names. \"My eldest sister, Rebecca, came home crying after her first day of school because there were two other Rebeccas in the class,\" she said. \"So at that point, Mom and Dad were like, 'OK, next time we're going to come up with something really original.' So the next sister was Sunshine -- I think that's more hippie than Butterfly -- and then me and then Eden, Angel and Harmony.\" Although she's happy to hear you say her name is a little quirky, the 29-year-old may cringe if you label her music as such. Boucher released her debut album, \"Another White Dash,\" on A&M Records in 2003 but says she was given the runaround when it came to her sophomore release. \"They say [my music] is too quirky. They always say it's too pop for the indie scene and too indie for the pop scene.\"  Watch (and listen) to some of Boucher's sounds \u00bb . After parting ways with her record label and having been allowed to keep the masters of her newer work, Boucher is going the independent route and will release the album June 2 on her own imprint. Called \"Scary Fragile,\" Boucher says, it was completed more than three years ago. She's determined to get it out there in spite of the challenges that come with being a DIY artist. \"The funding is my bank account, and it's not a very big bank account,\" she said. \"But I love working, and I work hard. It's a lot easier to work hard when there's a vision and there's a good group of people behind you.\" Constant encouragement from fans -- via her MySpace and Facebook pages -- has fueled her determination. She's also gotten some breaks: \"Grey's Anatomy\" has used several of Boucher's songs. She performed as the opening act on Sarah McLachlan's \"Afterglow\" tour, and she shared the vocal work with David Bowie on a cover of his hit song \"Changes\" for the \"Shrek 2\" movie soundtrack. And in a show of support, fellow Aussie Nicole Kidman recently showed up at one of Boucher's gigs in Nashville, Tennessee, where Boucher now lives. Currently on a mini tour of the United States, Butterfly Boucher fluttered (sorry) into CNN this week to talk about heartache, grand pianos and nicknames. CNN: What has it been like growing up with a name like Butterfly? Do you feel like you've grown into that name? Butterfly Boucher: It does, yeah. I'm out of the cocoon, definitely, and I'm glad! I do I feel like I've had to grow into the name. Occasionally ... I catch it and I'm like, \"Butterfly! That's ridiculous! What kind of a name is that?\" Actually most of my friends call me Butter or Butters. CNN: How was music a part of your upbringing in Australia? Boucher: It was a huge part of my life growing up. My dad was a musician; he was a rock 'n' roller-songwriter kind of guy. So it's definitely in my blood. I ... remember lying under a grand piano and just listening to [my dad and his friends] record in the other room and just loving this big black shiny piano, just the whole concept of music. I was in dreamland. CNN: One of the standout lines from this past season of \"American Idol\" was when the judge Kara DioGuardi said the music business is paved with heartache. Do you agree with that sentiment? Boucher: Absolutely. ... Artists tend to be kind of emotional people. If it's good art, it should come from your soul, and it's coming from an emotional part of you. So it is very hard. Over the years, I've learned to balance the business side with the passionate artist side, because you just get too hurt. You take everything too personally, and sometimes you've got to make decisions that you're going to compromise things. I get depressed, but then you've gotta get through it. The things that get you through are my fans and the whole generation of MySpace and Facebook. Every day I'm getting just little comments like \"your music means so much to me.\" Every day I get that, so it's a constant encouragement from fans and new people that are discovering you. I have got it pretty good. CNN: Why did you call your album \"Scary Fragile?\" Boucher: It was just a song title of one of the songs. ... There was no real deep reason behind it. I just liked that song, and I thought none of the other song titles sounded like an album. For a while I was calling it \"Just Because,\" and that was kind of lame. I don't want to be too deep with my album titles. I just want it to be catchy and something that you'll remember and then let the music and the lyrics do the rest of it. CNN: How do you like living in Nashville? Boucher: Ah, Nashville! I've been there for about 10 years. In the last few years, it's changed a lot. There are a lot of new people coming in. It helps that people like Jack White are embracing it, and Sheryl Crow. There are so many artists that secretly have a place there. And it's just this great music city. There are more venues, more coffee shops. There are new collaborations, and everybody's idea of what a good song is is changing, which I think is healthy for Nashville. I love it. CNN: What do you miss most about Australia? Boucher: The meat pies! I always crave meat pies. Sometimes I miss the smell of Australia. Although if you go to L.A. you can get it because they have a lot of eucalyptus trees there. So when it rains, it smells a bit like Australia."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Australian singer-songwriter Butterfly Boucher, known for her unique music, went independent after her 2003 debut due to industry challenges.

He said: \u2018I have been absolutely delighted (by the standard of refereeing this season). The referees we have had this season have done really well, it\u2019s surprised me. One or two of the younger ones who have been criticised in the past have done well. Even on Saturday, I think Craig Pawson will be a very good referee in the future. \u2018What surprised me a little bit is that a south London derby like that, when we get a young, quite inexperienced Premier League referee, even though he\u2019s a good one. People like Mark Clattenburg have not got a game. It bewilders me if I am honest.\u2019 Warnock says he has generally been impressed by referee standards this season in the Premier League .

Tonight, after a performance which helped to write another chapter in one of the season's most romantic fairy tales, Atletico Madrid allowed itself to dream of its own special one -- La Primera -- the first. Atletico, for so long a club living in the shadow of city rival Real, has the opportunity to make history not just at home but also on the European stage. A convincing 3-1 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge secured a place in the Champions League final and allowed the dream of a league and European double to prosper. This Atletico team has guts, resilience and an indefatigable spirit -- but what it also has, in abundance, is quality. Trailing to Fernando Torres' strike, Atletico offered a brutal riposte with Adrian Lopez leveling before Diego Costa and Arda Turan applied the finishing touches. Four points clear at the top of La Liga with three games remaining and a clash with Real to decide the destiny of the Champions League trophy to come in Lisbon on May 24, this is turning out to be some season for Atletico. \"It's a dream,\" Atletico midfielder Tiago told Sky Sports. \"We have a great spirit, we are a great team, we all work together, now we are in the final in Lisbon, the dreams can be true. \"It is not easy to play here, we know that. But we knew Chelsea had to play more. \"We know we are very good away from home. After our goal Chelsea went down a bit, but we were confident and now we are there. \"We know Real Madrid is a fantastic team with great players. They can win the game in any action but we are there. Last year we won the Cup in their stadium so we are confident.\" Not since 1996 has Los Rojiblancos won the domestic title but managed by Diego Simeone, who was part of that team 18 years ago, it now stands on the brink of history. Simeone, who presides over a budget nearly five times smaller than Real, has worked wonders but perhaps even would not have expected his players to record such an impressive victory. To score three goals away from home in European competition is a marked achievement, but to do so against Chelsea, a team whose defense has been so miserly in the competition, is staggering. Chelsea, derided for its defensive tactics and considered an \"enemy of football\" by some because of its negative approach, has already answered its critics on numerous occasions this season. A fine victory at Liverpool on Sunday proved once again that Mourinho's tactics, however unpalatable, gain results. But on this occasion, the solidity and cohesion which had caused such frustration in Madrid last week, was missing. The dour goalless draw in the opening leg led to plenty of accusations that Chelsea had not attempted to win the game but simply stifle Atletico. There is no doubt that Mourinho has been hurt by the criticism and hit back at his detractors by claiming that \"at this moment, football is full of philosophers.\" While everybody appears to have an opinion on Chelsea's defensive approach, Mourinho sticks to the belief which has made him a serial winner -- winning at all costs. The prospect of facing his former employer, Real Madrid, in the final added another subplot to an already intriguing tie. Eden Hazard, back from injury, was restored to the side, and Chelsea, often so adroit at scraping through tight contests, appeared confident. Yet it was the visitors who began the brighter of the two. Atletico, on the brink of the domestic title and chasing a place in the final for the first time in 40 years, played with a sense of purpose and came within inches of taking an early lead. Koke, influential throughout, aimed what looked like a cross towards goal only for the ball to sail over Chelsea goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer and smash against the crossbar. Chelsea responded with David Luiz's overhead kick sailing just wide of the far post as the home side stepped up the pressure. And with 11 minutes of the first half remaining, the home side finally made the breakthrough. Willian escaped his marker on the right before finding Cesar Azpilicueta, who in turn found Torres to fire home from inside the penalty area. Torres, who began his career at Atletico and scored 84 goals in 214 games for the club before moving to Liverpool in 2007, refused to celebrate but that gesture did not detract from the significance of the strike. Buoyed by the goal, Chelsea began to take control and with its resilient defense holding Atletico comfortably, the visitors appeared rattled. But with just a minute of the opening period remaining, the game was turned on its head. Tiago, once of Chelsea, picked out Juanfran at the far post and when he crossed the ball into the penalty area, Lopez was on hand to steer the ball home. Mourinho's defense, such an integral part of his side's success, appeared brittle for the first time in the competition and it never really recovered. Within minutes of the restart, Schwarzer was forced to produce a fine save to deny Turan after the Atletico midfielder had found space inside the penalty area. While Schwarzer performed heroics at one end, Thibaut Courtois, on loan from Chelsea, did similar at the other. John Terry's powerful header looked certain to find the net but Courtois produced an astonishing stop to deny the Chelsea captain. That save appeared to change the momentum of the contest and slowly but surely, Atletico began to turn the screw . With an hour of the game gone, Atletico finally struck and grabbed the initiative. Diego Costa, a man constantly linked with a move to Chelsea, was fouled inside the penalty area by Samuel Eto'o. The Spain striker, who endured a nervous wait to take the spot kick after the ball failed to settle on the spot, fired home emphatically to put his side within touching distance of glory. An eerie silence engulfed Stamford Bridge and but for a few thousand Spaniards clad in red and white, a sense of hopelessness began to emanate. Chelsea, to its credit, refused to give up the fight and came perilously close to equalizing within five minutes. Willian's exquisite free kick caused panic in the Atletico defense and Luiz sent a header crashing against the post when the ball seemed destined for the net. Chelsea, by now beginning to look ragged and forlorn, strained every sinew in an attempt to gain some sort of foothold to launch a comeback. But as the home side pushed forward, Atletico countered and in doing so, swiftly put the tie beyond Chelsea's reach. Once again, a wonderful switch of play caught Chelsea sleeping and after sending a powerful header against the crossbar from Juanfran's cross, Arda tucked away the rebound from his own effort. That strike sent Simeone down the touchline dancing a jig of delight a la Mourinho all those years ago. It is a jig he will hope to dance again in Lisbon with the whole world watching."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Despite Chelsea's defensive tactics and an initial strike by Fernando Torres, Atletico Madrid, under Diego Simeone's management, secured a 3-1 victory.

As a treat for her 90th birthday, Mrs Martin's daughter Ruth Reeves, 66, took her back to visit Sheerness, Kent, where she grew up, last week. The great-grandmother-of-five was stunned when she spotted a CD called 'Songs of Sheppey' by her first love - 'Les Hogan'. Mrs Martin recognised the name as she browsed gifts in the Blue Town Heritage Centre on April 23 but could not put her finger on why. But the penny only dropped two days later when the grandmother-of-four saw the familiar name again on a book of poetry in Minster Abbey, Kent, called 'Beyond the Skies.' Curious Mrs Martin then tracked her former sweetheart down through his book publisher.

'I was a member of Trinity Church and the vicar said I must join the youth club, so I did and that is where I met Beryl. 'I took her to the pictures a few times. We were good friends.'

In the latest violence, suspected militants killed at least 25 Egyptian soldiers with rocket-propelled grenades in the Sinai Peninsula. Russia's Federal Aviation Agency has ordered airlines to prepare plans to airlift Russian tourists from Egypt, the Moscow Times reported. Russia's largest airline, Aeroflot, said it was ready to begin evacuating passengers from the country as soon as it was instructed to do so. Late last week France also announced that it had a plan to evacuate its citizens under review. Travel advice hardens . Russia was among other governments that had already hardened their travel advice on Egypt following the killing last week of more than 500 people in Cairo and other cities in protests against the military overthrow of the government of Mohamed Morsi. Having advised its citizens against traveling to Egypt, on Thursday Russia barred tour operators from selling vacations to the country. Germany extended its advice against travel to the country to include the Red Sea beach resorts around Hurghada and Sharm El-Sheikh -- areas that have been largely immune from the unrest of recent months and that foreign governments have tended to advise were safe. Last week the government of Hong Kong also raised its travel warning, to \"black,\" advising against all travel. On Wednesday night, following the day of violence in Egypt in which hundreds of people died as security forces cleared pro-Morsi sit-ins, vacationers in Hurghada had letters posted through their hotel bedroom doors telling them to stay within the hotel grounds and that all excursions had been canceled, the TravelMole website reported. U.S. and British travel advisories on Egypt remain basically unchanged. The U.S. State Department continues to urge its citizens to leave Egypt, if they can. Any remaining in the country should monitor local media for updates on the unrest, it says. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against travel to Egypt, except the Red Sea resorts. The FCO has for some time advised against travel to the lawless Sinai Peninsula, where the recent grenade attack on Egyptian soldiers took place, except for the resort areas. Compensation . Government travel advisories are important not only for travelers' safety but because they affect what compensation they can claim. Following the German government's announcement, the tour operator TUI Germany said it was cancelling all trips to Egypt until September 15 and that travelers already in its resorts could stay for the remainder of their holiday or leave early. In Britain, a travel journalist specializing in the Middle East, Matthew Teller, told the Guardian: \"What the FCO does or doesn't say rules the roost in terms of what tour operators can and can't offer clients.\" Travelers were unlikely to be able to change their plans if they were booked to travel in an area, such as Sharm el-Sheikh and other Red Sea resorts, that the government deemed safe, he said. Cancellations . Other large travel firms were altering or canceling their Egypt travel programs, in addition to TUI. Thomas Cook said it had canceled all excursions from Red Sea resorts to Cairo, Luxor and sights including Moses Mountain and St Catherine's Monastery on the Sinai Peninsula. Kuoni, the UK-based operator, has also canceled all Egyptian excursions for 30 days. British Airways has changed its flight schedules to Cairo to avoid the dusk-to-dawn curfew the government has imposed as part of its state of emergency, although tour operators are still being allowed to operate overnight transfers to Sharm el-Sheikh. \"We are also offering customers the option of rebooking to a later date, or to another destination,\" a BA spokesman said. Most tourists fly to the Red Sea resorts directly. Easyjet, which runs flights to Sharm el-Sheikh, said it was allowing some passengers with flights booked to Egypt within the next few days to change their destination. The cruise operators MSC, Costa and Holland America Line have also reportedly canceled their Egypt-bound ships. Tourism vital . The latest violence in months of unrest in Egypt can only do further damage to the country's vital tourism industry, which normally employs around 10% of the workforce and brought in $10 billion in 2012. As chaos has increasingly gripped the country, beginning with anti-government protests in 2011 that led to the overthrow of the Hosni Mubarak regime, tourist numbers have fallen by almost one-third -- from 14 million in 2010 to 10.5 million last year.

But up until now, there has been very little direct evidence of a supernova's dust\u2010making capabilities. The little evidence astronomers did have could not account for the massive amount of dust detected in young, distant galaxies. Now new images of the famed Supernova 1987A have, for the first time, captured the remains of the exploding star brimming with freshly formed dust. This artist's illustration shows Supernova 1987A, based on real data with the cold, inner regions of the exploded star's remnants (in red) where tremendous  amounts of dust were detected and imaged. This inner region is contrasted with the outer shell (lacy white and blue circles), where the blast wave from the supernova is colliding with the envelope of gas ejected  from the star prior to its powerful detonation . If enough of this dust makes the perilous transition into interstellar space, it could explain how many galaxies acquired their dusty, dusky appearance. \u2018We have found a remarkably large dust mass concentrated in the central part of the ejecta from a relatively young and nearby supernova,\u2019 said Remy Indebetouw, an astronomer at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Charlottesville. \u2018This is the first time we've been able to really image where the dust has formed, which is important in understanding the evolution of galaxies.\u2019 An international team of astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope to observe the glowing remains of Supernova 1987A. This image shows the remnant of Supernova 1987A  in light of very different wavelengths. The ALMA Telescope data (in red) shows newly formed dust in the centre of the remnant as Hubble (in green) and Chandra (in blue) data show the expanding shock wave . In February of 1987 astronomers observing the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby dwarf galaxy, noticed the sudden appearance of what looked like a new star. In fact they weren\u2019t watching the beginnings of a star but the end of one and the brightest supernova seen from Earth in the four centuries since the telescope was invented. By the next morning news of the discovery had spread across the globe and southern hemisphere stargazers began watching the aftermath of this enormous stellar explosion, known as a supernova. In the two and a half decades since then, the remnant of Supernova 1987A has continued to be a focus for researchers around the world, providing a wealth of information about one of the Universe\u2019s most extreme events. Located more than 160,000 light years away, the light of the catastrophic explosion only reached Earth in February 1987. Before it exploded, the star generated huge amounts of gas, including a thick, dense, clumpy ring more than a light year across. Astronomers predicted that as the gas cooled after the explosion, large amounts of dust would form as atoms of oxygen, carbon, and silicon bonded together in the cold central regions of the remnant. However, earlier observations of SN 1987A with infrared telescopes, made during the first 500 days after the explosion, detected only a small amount of hot dust. Using, the research team was able to image the far more abundant cold dust, which glows brightly in millimetre and submillimetre light. The astronomers estimate that the remnant now contains about 25 per cent the mass of the sun in newly formed dust. They also found that significant amounts of carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide have formed. \u2018SN 1987A is a special place since it hasn't mixed with the surrounding environment, so what we see there was made there,\u2019 said Dr Indebetouw. \u2018The new ALMA results, which are the first of their kind, reveal a supernova remnant chock full of material that simply did not exist a few decades ago.\u2019 Supernovae, however, can both create and destroy dust grains. As the shockwave from the initial explosion radiated out into space, it produced bright glowing rings of material, as seen in earlier observations with the Hubble Telescope. After hitting this envelope of gas, which . was sloughed off by the progenitor red giant star as it neared the end . of its life, a portion of this powerful explosion rebounded back towards . the centre of the remnant. Last year, a team of astronomers led by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) produced incredible high resolution radio images of the expanding SN 1987A remnant at millimetre wavelengths. In this image contours of different wavelengths of radio emissions and a Hubble space telescope image of Supernova 1987A combined to provide a unique view of its death throes . Cosmic dust consists of tiny particles of solid material floating around in the space between the stars. Unlike the dust you find in your house, it is more like smoke with small particles varying from collections of just a few molecules to grains of 0.1 mm in size. D . It helps stars form, and it is also the raw material from which planets like the Earth are created. Supernovae are thought to be a main source of that dust - especially in the early universe. But . up until now, there has been very little direct evidence of a . supernova's dust\u2010making capabilities, and could not account for the . massive amount of dust detected in young, distant galaxies. \u2018At some point, this rebound shockwave will slam into these billowing clumps of freshly minted dust,\u2019 said Dr Indebetouw. \u2018It's likely that some fraction of the dust will be blasted apart at that point. It's hard to predict exactly how much \u2014 maybe only a little, possibly a half or two thirds.\u2019 If a good fraction survives and makes it into interstellar space, it could account for the copious dust astronomers detect in the early universe. \u2018Really early galaxies are incredibly dusty and this dust plays a major role in the evolution of galaxies,\u2019 added Mikako Matsuura of University College London, UK. \u2018Today we know dust can be created in several ways, but in the early universe most of it must have come from supernovae. We finally have direct evidence to support that theory.\u2019 In 1987 astronomers observing the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby dwarf galaxy, noticed the sudden appearance of what looked like a new star.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\nLilongwe, Malawi (CNN) -- Despite a majestic lake stretching through its eastern border that gives way to beautiful beaches, Malawi is the African country less-traveled. But it's the place to be if you want to enjoy a natural paradise without everybody else. Though it hasn't become a booming destination like Tanzania, Kenya or South Africa, Malawi has numerous attractions. Named one of the top 10 places to go in 2014 by Lonely Planet, Malawi is one of the lesser known destinations on the travel guide's annual list, which includes Brazil, Sweden and the Seychelles. The country is touted for its wildlife and beaches. But there's more to Malawi than animal parks, warm sands and Madonna's adoptions. 1. The locals are friendly . Called the \"Warm Heart of Africa,\" in the native language, Malawi locals exude friendliness. It's common for strangers to wave and greet visitors as if they know them. And it's easy to make them smile with a \"moni\" (pronounced mo-nee, not money), which means hello in Chichewa, the local language, and \"Zikomo\" (thank you). Curious kids often come by to say hi and see what you're up to. The refrain I heard repeatedly was, \"Welcome. You are welcome.\" Although overt friendliness often arouses suspicion in the world traveler, especially when someone's trying to sell you tchotckes, there's hardly any hawking or selling of tacky souvenirs in Malawi -- the people are genuinely friendly. Founded in 1964, Malawi has never experienced a civil war. 2. It's not crowded . You can enjoy the pristine views of massive Lake Malawi -- known locally as Lake Nyasa, it's the ninth largest lake in the world -- without having your perfect day wrecked by a bunch of vacationers blasting horrible music. Instead, you'll hear restaurants jamming 1990s pop music such as the Backstreet Boys -- can't win them all. Another perk: you won't have to jostle for reservations at hotels, restaurants or game parks. Most of the travelers you'll likely encounter in Malawi are tobacco businessmen or NGO workers -- nary a tourist in sight. Even the capital of Lilongwe has the relaxed vibe of a garden. There are few cars and you can walk to places without feeling overwhelmed or fearful of getting run over. (The country's commercial capital of Blantyre is much busier.) You can go from the high life of the Kumbali Country Lodge, where Madonna stays, or sleep in more budget accommodations. 3. Lake Malawi is spectacular . Although Malawi is landlocked, its giant, freshwater lake is its life blood. The sunny beaches of Lake Malawi are golden and the waters are nearly empty except for a few boats. Lake Malawi is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's home to the largest number of fish species of any lake in the world, thought to be between 500 and 1,000, according to UNESCO. It's perfect for freshwater snorkeling and diving in clear water. The lake draws in a variety of bird species, as well as hippos, warthogs, baboons and occasional elephants. Not bad company to enjoy the water with (maybe not the hippos). 4. Rehabilitated game parks and natural reserves . Tour companies offer safaris in parks and reserves that include eco-friendly trips, mountain biking, horseback riding and traditional housing stays. One of the best known parks is Majete Wildlife Reserve, which became a target for poaching that continued into the 1990s. By the 2000s, thanks to a partnership between the government and a non-profit organization, the park was repopulated and rehabilitated. The Big Five (elephant, rhino, lion, leopard, buffalo) can be viewed here. \"Malawi is not a wildlife destination, it's not Masai Mara, but that's changing,\" says Rob McConaghy of Ulendo, a travel group operating in Malawi. \"Majete National Park is run as a private park and has reintroduced so much game, you can see the Big Five now.\" 5. Easygoing vibe . Malawi is, in large part, a place of peace and quiet, without the traffic jams and hassles of city life. The country is largely rural; only 15.7% of the population live in urban areas. Clear skies and bright stars make it thrilling for star gazers. The trend is toward self-drive holidays -- visitors rent cars and drive themselves through the country. \"As a country, people perceive Malawi being safe, stable and peaceful,\" says McConaghy. \"It gives an impression of a nice, warm friendly country to travel in.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Malawi, a less-traveled African paradise, was a top 10 Lonely Planet destination in 2014. The country's friendly locals, uncrowded attractions, and the biodiversity of Lake Malawi, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, contribute to its appeal.

Falcon's Fury stands at 335ft high (102 metres) with riders dropping 60 mph straight down, face first. It is the tallest freestanding rollercoaster structure in North America. Riders plunge down in a six-second free fall . Tom described the ride as 'awesome'. Jeff Hornick, director of design and engineering at Busch Gardens, said: 'It's a different kind of thrill ride than a roller coaster. 'It's really polarizing. You're either really going to want to ride it or not want to ride it at all.' Park officials say it's the tallest, free-standing drop tower in North America and the only one in the world to feature forward tilting seats. Tom was joined on the ride, opened in May, by his best friend Sophie Lee, who starred alongside him in TV show Tom Daley Goes Global . Hornick says guests can see downtown Tampa and even St. Petersburg, some 30 miles away from the top of the ride. Once riders get to the top of the tower, a computer program determines how long it stays at the peak before the gut-wrenching plunge. Hornick said the wait time at the top will be randomised, anywhere from one to five seconds. During the drop, riders will experience an estimated G-force of 3.5gs. Falcon's Fury is the centerpiece of a newly designed section in the park called Pantopia . Engineers had to drive 105 steel support beams as deep as 205ft into the ground before fusing them together with a concrete cap to make it secure. A 4ft-thick base also secures the steel tower to the foundation. Falcon's Fury is the centerpiece of a newly designed section in the park called Pantopia that includes new retail and food areas. The park wanted more of a scary, thrill ride to debut this year following a few years of new family friendly rides and stage shows. 'Drop towers have been popular at theme parks for many years, but what you see with Falcon's Fury is the industry's relentless drive for innovation,' said Jeremy Schoolfield, editor-in-chief of Funworld Magazine. Busch Gardens wanted more of a scary, thrill ride to debut this year following a few years of new family friendly rides and stage shows . 'Ride designers are always looking for new twists on classic attractions, and Fury's pivoting seats certainly fit that bill. 'Putting riders in a facedown position as they drop toward the ground is definitely a new take on this type of ride.' There are taller drop towers in the U.S., but they are integrated with other rides or buildings. Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Magic Mountain in California has a 400-foot drop and the Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey will have a 415-foot drop when it's constructed later this year. Both of those are attached to other rides.

In its latest bout of saber-rattling, North Korea on Friday warned of the possibility of \"strong physical counter-measures\" against South Korea after the United Nations imposed tougher sanctions against the North earlier this week. The threat against South Korea came a day after the North said it would carry out a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches as part of a new phase of confrontation with the United States. The statement Friday from North Korea's Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said it would take action against South Korea if it \"takes a direct part\" in the U.N. sanctions. U.N. Security Council slams North Korea . The South Korean Unification Ministry declined to comment specifically on the new threats from Pyongyang. It reiterated its stance that North Korea should refrain from further provocations. \"Now is a moment when I think all parties in the six-party process, in particular here, North Korea, should turn their attention to how to peacefully and diplomatically address challenges that concern them,\" U.S. envoy Glyn Davies said from Beijing. The two Koreas have technically still been at war since the all-out conflict between them in the 1950s. Smaller scale clashes have occurred since then, most recently in November 2010 when North Korea shelled a South Korean island, killing several people. South Korea and the United States are often the focus of menacing language from Pyongyang, but the latest U.N. sanctions, a response to a long-range rocket launched last month by the North, appear to have prompted a ratcheting up of the threats. Opinion: For the U.N. and North Korea -- Game on . A displeased Chinese editorial . At the same time, North Korea's strong words and vow to conduct a third nuclear test -- previous ones took place in 2006 and 2009 -- appear to be testing the patience of its main ally, China, which voted in favor of the U.N. sanctions this week. An editorial published Friday in the English-language edition of the state-run Chinese newspaper Global Times struck a displeased tone over Pyongyang's comments a day earlier. \"China's role and position are clear when discussing the North Korea issue in the U.N. Security Council,\" the editorial said. \"If North Korea engages in further nuclear tests, China will not hesitate to reduce its assistance to North Korea.\" That prospect carries weight, since North Korea's impoverished economy relies heavily on China to stay afloat. Global Times, whose editorial line often but not always reflects official Chinese policy, made it clear, though, that Beijing isn't about to cut Pyongyang loose. Timeline: North Korea's rocket-fueled obsession . \"If the U.S., Japan and South Korea promote extreme U.N. sanctions on North Korea, China will resolutely stop them and force them to amend these draft resolutions,\" the editorial said. Global Times noted that Beijing had put \"a lot of effort into amendments\" to the resolution approved by the Security Council this week. \"It seems that North Korea does not appreciate China's efforts,\" it said. \"It criticized China without explicitly naming it in its statement yesterday.\" The newspaper was referring to a passage in the controversial North Korean statement Thursday that said that \"big countries, which are obliged to take the lead in building a fair world order, are abandoning without hesitation even elementary principle, under the influence of the U.S. arbitrary and high-handed practices.\" The Global Times editorial also suggested that North Korea shouldn't rank too highly among China's priorities. \"China hopes for a stable peninsula, but it's not the end of the world if there's trouble there,\" it said, referring to the Korean peninsula that comprises North and South Korea. \"This should be the baseline of China's position.\" The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Thursday had urged North Korea and the West to \"keep calm, remain cautious and refrain from any action that might escalate the situation in the region.\" How dangerous is North Korea's nuke capability? U.S. concerned but prepared . U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said Thursday there are no \"outward indications\" that North Korea is about to conduct a nuclear test, but he admitted it would be hard to determine that in advance. \"They have the capability, frankly, to conduct these tests in a way that makes it very difficult to determine whether or not they are doing it,\" he said in a Pentagon press conference. \"We are very concerned with North Korea's continuing provocative behavior,\" Panetta said, but he added that the United States is \"fully prepared\" to deal with any provocations.

Authorities didn't divulge details Friday about what led to the charge. But Peterson's lawyer said the \"charged conduct involves using a switch to spank his son\" -- explaining that his client did so while doling out discipline \"much like \"he experienced as a child growing up in east Texas.\" Rusty Hardin said \"Adrian never intended to harm his son and deeply regrets the unintentional injury.\" Rather, Hardin characterized the former NFL MVP as \"a loving father who used his judgment as a parent to discipline his son.\" Peterson will travel to Houston and will then \"post bond as soon as it can be arranged,\" according to Hardin. \"(Peterson) will continue to insist on his innocence of any intended wrongdoing,\" the lawyer said. Hardin claims that his client has \"cooperated fully with authorities and voluntarily testified before the grand jury for several hours.\" \"Adrian will address the charges with the same respect and responsiveness he has brought to this inquiry from its beginning,\" the lawyer said. Right after news broke of the indictment, the Vikings released a statement saying they were \"in the process of gathering information regarding the legal situation.\" The team came back a short time later to announce that its offensive catalyst has been deactivated for Sunday's game against the New England Patriots. According to Texas law, a person can be convicted of an injury to a child offense if they are proven to have caused bodily or mental injury \"intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or with criminal negligence\" or causing such harm by omission. A child, by this definition, must be 14 years old or younger. Peterson's indictment prompted a flurry of reaction on Twitter. Some defended him and criticized authorities for pressing charges, saying that such forms of discipline are common and acceptable. \"Adrian Peterson was indicted in TX for swatting his son with a switch! Who knew that was illegal, cuz my mama would b in jail!\" tweeted comedian D.L. Hughley. Others came down hard on the Vikings star, including one man who was \"sickened.\" \"Anyone who defends this is a coward,\" one person tweeted. 2-year-old son allegedly killed by another man . The alleged criminal offense took place in Montgomery County, which is north of Houston. The 29-year-old Peterson grew up in Palestine, Texas, which is 150 miles north of Houston and 100 miles southeast of Dallas. A running back for the Vikings since 2007, he rushed for 75 yards in his team's season-opening 34-6 rout of the St. Louis Rams. In 2012, he was named the league's most valuable player when he ran for 2,097 yards, just nine yards short of the single-season mark, the NFL said. For all his exploits on the field, Peterson has dealt with heartache and headaches. That includes the death of his brother in 2007, a day before he participated in the NFL's skill testing event for potential draft picks. And last year, Peterson's 2-year-old son died after allegedly being abused by another man. Authorities in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, found that child unresponsive, and later determined he'd suffered injuries to his head consistent with abuse. Joseph Robert Patterson, the boyfriend of the boy's mother, was arrested and eventually charged with murder. Patterson has denied the charge and said the boy choked on strawberry fruit snacks, the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, reported. News of Peterson's indictment casts another shadow over the NFL, which is reeling from the fallout over then-Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Ric allegedly punching his then-fiancee Janay Palmer in a casino elevator. A New Jersey grand jury indicted Rice for third-degree aggravated assault; he pleaded not guilty and entered a pretrial intervention program for first-time offenders that could clear him if he successfully completes the requirements.

The charge, adding to NFL's woes after Ray Rice's assault case, stems from Peterson disciplining his son with a switch.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\nImagine this:  You've toiled at a company for years and followed all the rules.  You're productive, diligent, and respected by your peers.  In short, you're a model employee.  But the latest round of raises that have consumed the office leave you thinking that your male colleagues -- despite having the same job title -- make more than you. You begin to suspect you're the victim of gender discrimination.  So, you decide it's time to \"lean in\" and secure the equal pay you deserve -- 77 cents on the dollar, the nation's going rate, just won't cut it. But when you take this information to your boss you're told that the company's pay practices are secret and you can be fired for discussing them. Throughout America, countless women find themselves between a rock and a hard place.   They suspect they're being denied equal pay, but have no way of confirming it.  Or worse, they don't know they're being shortchanged because company policies prevent them from discussing their wages. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 was passed to prohibit wage discrimination on the basis of sex and sought to ensure that women earn equal pay for equal work.  Its purpose was clear: Eliminate the gender wage gap, which hurts women and families.  But 50 years later, pay discrimination is alive and well.   Gag rules that require employees to keep their pay secret perpetuate this inequity. It's time for our wages to get out from behind the secrecy paywall. A majority of private sector workplaces in America  prohibit or discourage employees from discussing their wages with co-workers.  As a result, employees who mention what they earn are threatened with retaliation, including harassment, demotion, or termination. Women who believe they're the victims of unequal pay face an impossible choice: Jeopardize their economic livelihood or suffer the indignity and economic consequences of discrimination.  Low-wage women workers -- many of whom live paycheck to paycheck and are seen as replaceable by their employers -- are especially likely to choose silence and live with pay discrimination rather than risk their jobs. Still others will have no clue that they are being paid less. Pay secrecy policies can keep women in the dark for years.  Take Lilly Ledbetter, who worked as a supervisor at a Goodyear plant in Gadsden, Alabama, for  nearly two decades without knowing that she had been denied equal pay.  Had it not been for an anonymous note, she would never have learned that she was earning substantially less than her male colleagues.  Pay secrecy facilitated Goodyear's discrimination. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has exacerbated the problem.  For decades, plaintiffs were typically afforded discovery, the opportunity to secure testimony and documents from their employer, before resolution of their claims.  But in two deeply divided decisions, the Supreme Court recently abandoned that practice and now requires plaintiffs to provide more detailed information about the alleged discrimination before discovery. This higher burden is nearly insurmountable for women alleging unequal pay.  Because of pay secrecy, their complaints often begin with a strong hunch that can only be verified through corporate records and sworn statements.  Denying them access to this basic information is tantamount to locking them out of the courthouse. Unsurprisingly, workplaces that have abandoned punitive pay secrecy, like the federal government and many unionized workplaces, have been particularly effective in reducing the gender wage gap.  Female federal workers are paid 89 cents, and unionized female workers 88 cents, for every dollar paid to men. Economists have posited that more transparent workplaces will lead to greater worker satisfaction and productivity, while closed pay practices will lead to lower motivation and mistrust of management.  Permitting workers to discuss their wages would also make managers more accountable. The Paycheck Fairness Act,  reintroduced in Congress, would prohibit retaliation against workers who discuss their wages.  The legislation has been blocked, but if passed, would finally close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act. It would permit workers to compare notes and determine whether they're being paid fairly, without fear of retribution. If the legislation continues to stall, President Obama can and should act.  He can sign an executive order requiring federal contractors to abandon punitive pay secrecy and protect nearly 22% of the American workforce.  Those refusing to comply would lose the government as a client. And let's not let states off the hook.  State laws can provide important protections against employer retaliation.  In August, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed a law banning retaliation against workers who inquire about salary. New Jersey  joins states like Vermont, Colorado, Michigan and California in outlining explicit protections for workers seeking equal pay. Justice Louis Brandeis famously said the best remedy for social and industrial disease was publicity and sunlight its most effective disinfectant. Fifty years after the Equal Pay Act, pay secrecy still masks discrimination.  There is only one way to fight this darkness: light.

Lord Tebbit suggested sales of junk food would be higher in areas where food banks are most popular . People use food banks to get basic items free and spend their remaining cash on junk food, Lord Tebbit claimed yesterday. The former Cabinet minister said there was a \u2018near infinite demand\u2019 for anything free. The Tory peer was speaking in a House of Lords debate about food banks \u2013 which Labour claim are booming because Coalition austerity policies leave many people unable to make ends meet. But Lord Tebbit suggested more people were using them because the number of banks has increased and they would prefer not to pay for food. It follows research showing the number of families claiming they are going hungry has fallen over the past five years \u2013 as the number of food banks has risen. The peer said: \u2018There is always a near infinite demand for valuable goods that are given away free. \u2018One can even notice it in the catering departments of this building. If food is given away at prices grossly below the markets more is used.\u2019 He invited environment minister Lord de Mauley to \u2018initiate some research into the sales of junk food in areas where\u00a0 people are living for their basic food on the food banks\u2019. The minister declined. Earlier this month Tory welfare minister Lord Freud said the demand for food banks was difficult to understand. \u2018Clearly nobody goes to a food bank willingly,\u2019 he added. \u2018However, it is very hard to know why people go to them.\u2019 The intervention came after a series of peers in the House of Lords had called on the Government to tackle the scale of food bank usage in the UK. Lord Palmer, an independent crossbench peer, said it was a \u2018scandal in today\u2019s society that food banks have to exist at all\u2019. Labour peers\u2019 leader Baroness Royall . of Blaisdon said food banks in the South West gave aid to more than . 40,000 adults and 20,000 children last year. She . described it as down to \u2018desperate pressing demand due to a cost of . living crisis\u2019 and called for Lord de Mauley to visit one. Lord de Mauley said he had visited a food bank and they were run by \u2018wonderful people and donated to by hugely generous folk\u2019. The Government has repeatedly questioned whether food banks are responding to growing need . \u2018They perform a very valuable service distributing food to people who really need it and they tend to operate at a local level,\u2019 he said. \u2018Britain has a great tradition of charitable giving and I think it would be a bad day when we started to interfere with that.\u2019 Only 8.1 per cent of Britons admitted to being unable to afford food in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 . Last . year Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove sparked outrage when he . claimed families become so poor they are forced to turn to food banks . because of their own \u2018decisions\u2019.

The number of food banks has increased over the past few years, with charities claiming that more than half a million people across the country have visited them.

A type of mineral 1.2 miles (2km) up the side of the canyon wall suggests that a huge glacier once passed through. While the idea of a glacier is controversial, the scientists say such a theory is the best explanation for their latest findings. Research led by Dr Selby Cull from Bryn Mawr College in Philadelphia suggests that part of Valles Marineris may have played host to an ancient glacier. Evidence comes from a mineral called jarosite found half way up the cliff wall (shown), which may have been the top of an ancient glacier that has long since disappeared . The research was led by Dr Selby Cull from the Department of Geology at Bryn Mawr College in Philadelphia. Evidence for the glacier comes in the form of the mineral jarosite being spotted in the wall, a sulphate that forms in highly acidic water with low temperatures - such as the top of a glacier on Mars. While evidence for glaciers on Mars has been spotted before, this is one of the first times evidence for one has been found in Valles Marineris. Named after the Mariner 9 Mars orbiter of 1971/1972, Valles Marineris is one of the largest systems of canyons in the solar system. At more than 2,500 miles (4,000 km) long, 120 miles (200 km) wide and up to x miles (7 km) deep it is among the largest canyon in the solar system. It is located on the Martian equator and stretches for a quarter of the planet\u2019s circumference. If it was located on Earth it would stretch across the entire US. One of its largest sections is the Ius Chasma, which is about 938km long, in which this latest discovery was made. Several theories for its formation have been proposed, including water erosion and a tectonic \u2018crack\u2019 in the Martian crust. The canyon itself is thought to have been formed by tectonic stresses, but Dr Cull tells MailOnline the best explanation for the discovery of jarosite here is that a glacier once filled half the canyon. The jarosite was found in a thin layer 330ft (100 metres) along part of the cliff wall, suggesting it was once the boundary of the top of an ancient glacier. \u2018The canyon wall starts at about zero metres elevation and descends to about -4,000 metres [2.5 miles],\u2019 she explains. \u2018We see the jarosite at -1,900 to -2,000 metres [1.18 to 1.24 miles], so about half-way down the canyon wall.\u2019 She continued: \u2018We found [jarosite] in a few places on Mars before, but the exciting thing here is we found it half way up a 3-mile [4.8km] high cliff face in the North Marineris. \u2018All previous jarosite deposits have been found in low-lying deposit areas, places where water would cool.\u2019 Jarosite usually forms in wet and acidic locations like rivers and groundwater, but Dr Cull explains that couldn\u2019t have happened here. 'It would have required half the valley to be filled with water, which would have left huge indicators and evidence that there had been water there, and there\u2019s no evidence,' she says. \u2018So we think the only viable way you see jarosite is if there was a glacier.\u2019 If true, this would be among the first mineralogical evidence for glaciers in the Ius Chasma - one of the largest portions of Valles Marineris. The mineral known as jarosite must have been desposited by highly acidic water at low temperature - and a glacier is the best explanation. Dr Cull says it could not have been a regular water flow such as a river as it would have had to fill half the deep canyon (Ius Chasma shown in image) The discovery was made using instruments on Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (left) and Esa's Mars Express (right) spacecraft. Further observations in future will be used to verify the findings . On average, Mars lies 141.6 million miles (227.9 million km) from the sun. With a diameter of 4,222 miles (6,795km), it\u2019s around half the size of the Earth and has an average temperature of -65\u00b0C (-85\u00b0F). The gravity there is much weaker than on Earth - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours. The atmosphere is also desperately thin - one per cent of Earth\u2019s pressure - and 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide. It boasts the solar system\u2019s biggest mountain \u2013 Olympus Mons, a dead volcano. This measures 335 miles (540 km) across and rises to a height of 88,000ft (26,800 metres), which is almost three times higher than Everest. Mars has two natural satellites - the moons Deimos and Phobos. The planet's red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface. Mars has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps. If they melted, the resulting liquid would cover the whole planet in water 36ft (11 metres) deep, according to Nasa. The team used data from two spacecraft, Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Esa's Mars Express, to make the findings. Dr Cull admits the theory that this canyon played host to a glacier remains controversial in the scientific community. But she says other explanations for this feature just don\u2019t make sense. One possibility was that this jarosite came from a water table but, as it is not near the surface, Dr Cull says this would require the water table to be slanted, \u2018which is a very strange thing for a water table to do.\u2019 She continues: \u2018If it was a glacier, it would be the top point of the glacier.' The mineral jarosite would form at the top of the glacier, where the ice melts, and be deposited on the cliff wall. One other theory is that this jarosite was deposited by an acid fog. Acid fog is essentially water vapour that is highly enriched in sulphur, which can be released during volcanic emissions. However, with no volcanic vents nearby, this theory looks unlikely. \u2018We are continuing to map Ius Chasma, and will map the surrounding wall surfaces to see if we can find this same mineral elsewhere,\u2019 Dr Cull adds. \u2018It\u2019s very exciting.\u2019 Named after the Mariner 9 Mars orbiter of 1971/1972, Valles Marineris is one of the largest systems of canyons in the solar system.

But that doesn't make it one of the friendliest. We have committed the cardinal subway sin: not 'validating' our tickets (by inserting them into a stamping machine on the platform). The punishment? An 8,000 Forints (\u00a320) fine. Budapest can only get better. Thankfully it does. A Danube delight: Budapest sits prettily on the banks of western Europe's longest river . The Hungarian capital - which divides into the hilly Buda on the Danube's western bank and the flatter, more commercial Pest on the eastern bank - has plenty of architectural splendours and cultural treasures, plus indulgent food and a lively nightlife. The city's cheap prices - around \u00a32 for a pint - attract stag do parties, but fortunately the local bars don't seem to specifically target these groups. We decide to see the main sights by bike and join a cycling tour run by Budapest Bike Breeze called Wheels And Meals. Moments after meeting - and with barely a glance each way - our energetic guide, Adam, leads us full pelt into Budapest's busiest square - Erzsebet Ter. We race around central Pest, stopping every five minutes for Adam to divulge titbits. For example, the Opera House is reminiscent of the Vienna State Opera (though smaller, so as not to outshine the seat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and the magnificent Neo-Gothic Parliament was inspired by Westminster. Now confident whizzing two-wheeled through the city, we speed along the riverfront. Scenes of Hungarian life: Local men focus on the serious pursuit of chess (and try desperately not to drop any pieces) at Budapest's Szechenyi Baths (left); St Stephen's Basilica, on the Pest side of the river (right) The sun is glistening on the Danube, cruise boats are pootling past... when I suddenly fly off my bike and crash to the ground. My boyfriend had somehow managed to wedge his handlebars under mine, thus careering me into the kerb. More embarrassed than injured, we cross the river to the medieval town of Buda, a Unesco World heritage site. Behind the fairytale-like Matthias Church - used as a cattle shed by the invading Turks - is Fisherman's Bastion, whose turrets provide the best views of Pest (and one of the settings for Lord Of The Rings). After a big bowl of goulash soup at the charmingly low-key Drum Cafe, we are back in our saddles. The final hours of our tour take in the wide boulevards of Varosliget district, Heroes' Square and the bizarre Vajdahunyad castle - with its mix of Baroque, Renaissance, Gothic and Romanesque styles. A scene from a different era: The city's famous Hotel Astoria Cafe looks like a refugee from another century . Afterwards, we collapse into leather armchairs for coffee and cakes at the city's legendary Gerbeaud Cukraszda caf\u00e9. Hungarians have a reputation for being stand-offish, but with a little persistence, seemingly frosty locals quickly warm up and keenly offer recommendations about their city. Understandably, however, they don't readily discuss life under communist rule. And you will need plenty of energy to tackle the House Of Terror - a museum which commemorates victims of that communist dictatorship, and those of the preceding Nazi years. With all of the explanatory text on the walls in Hungarian, an English audio guide is crucial. Twenty-five minutes' drive away lies another reminder of Hungary's soviet history: Memento Park, the unusual home for a collection of redundant communist statues, which were torn down after the regime collapsed in 1989. Looking from the past to the future: The historic Buda district of the city gazes across at more modern Pest . Here, avoid a guide and do your own background reading instead. The only guide on offer was softly spoken with a thick Hungarian accent and had an infuriating habit of talking as she walked away from the group towards the next statue. Combined with the noisy gravel crunching under 20 tourists' feet and endless overhead planes, the tour was virtually inaudible. More subtle reminders of the nation's difficult history are the abandoned Stock Exchange and National Ballet buildings, plus other crumbling structures now reincarnated as sprawling bars known as 'ruin pubs'. At the end of a frantic weekend, we forgo these watering holes, instead treating ourselves to a soak in the 21 different pools at the Szechenyi Turkish baths.

A mother-of-three has claimed that fathers are as 'useful as t*ts on a bull' following the arrival of a baby because newborns 'don't want dad'. Milli Hill, 40, from Somerset, has stirred up controversy with her comments - written in a column for Best Daily - in response to the news Labour plan to extend paternity leave to four weeks. She writes: 'This time of nurturing a tiny life is mainly (not 'just', but 'mainly'), for mums, and dads who have visions of bonding in this time are likely to end up feeling disappointed, left out and about as useful as t*ts on a bull.' She added: 'Whilst a woman can perform brain surgery or lead a multi-national, I'm afraid to break it to you that there is something a man can't do \u2013 and that's be a mother. 'As I discovered when I realised that my breast-pump was the worst twenty quid I ever spent: no matter what technology you employ or how good your intent, to a baby this is meaningless. 'A small breastfed baby doesn't want a plastic teat and quite often, they don't want dad either. They just want you. 'More time for dads in the early weeks will be largely wasted, because, no matter what breast-pump manufacturers or Westminster policy makers might try to tell you, the so-called \"Paternity Month\" is actually a \"Babymoon\", an epic and life-changing love-in, and it belongs uniquely to mother and child.' Milli's comments sparked a furious reaction on Twitter as parents responded to her views. BeautifulBairns tweeted that Milli was 'utterly wrong' and Phyllida Warmington pointed out: 'I do think a dads presence in the early days in invaluable for practical/emotional support for the mother.' Parenting blogger Tom Briggs, pictured, thinks fathers can play an important role in their child's first days . Katherine Woodbury tweeted: 'My husband and I would have done ANYTHING for more time together. Not all births/PN are straightforward.' Jonathan, 39, a father-of-two, from Hertfordshire, said he was outraged by Milli's comments. He told MailOnline: 'She's made me angry as she generalises and assumes the early days of having a baby are the same for all parents. In fact, childbirth and the days that follow are a unique experience and different for everyone.' Jonathan said that Milli fails to consider how mothers may need the support of their partner if they are recovering from a caesarean section, have other children to attend to, or are simply overwhelmed by becoming a new mother. His own wife had C-sections to deliver both their children and he said she needed him more than ever afterwards. He said she would have struggled if he had not been able to take an extra week holiday following his two-week paternity leave. Fathers argued that they can still bond with their babies with skin-on-skin contact (photo posed by models) Milli's article prompted reaction on social media including this tweet from Katherine Woodbury, left, who said mothers need their partner if a birth was not straightforward, and 'King Of Dads said they were irked, right . He said: 'Particularly after our second child was born, I was needed at home to help look after our two-year-old. 'I wanted to be there to get to know my children and to support my wife, even if that just meant making her a cup of tea.' He added he could bond with his newborns by skin-on-skin contact even if he couldn't feed them. Parenting blogger Tom Briggs, who runs the website\u00a0diaryofthedad.co.uk, agrees. He said: 'I'd say that it's essential that dads are around from birth - although there are things that we obviously can't do, such as breastfeeding, there's lots that we can do to support our partners and, just as importantly, bond with our children. 'If you take into consideration the fact that we're already at a disadvantage due to biological reasons, it's even more important that we're about in the first few weeks to bond with them and I don't think she has considered dads' feelings. 'The first few weeks of being a parent is certainly not something that's exclusive to mother and child. Parenting is a shared privilege and responsibility from the word go.' Speaking to MailOnline today, Milli said she was sorry if her article had offended parents. She said: 'I'm aware that the article has sparked controversy and I am extremely sorry if I have offended fathers - this was not my intention. 'I do wish I had written more about the importance of fathers but the focus of my article was motherhood and the point I wished to make was that, in particular in the early weeks, there is a mother-baby relationship underway which is very intense and special. Milli believes the most important person to a newborn is their mother and the 'babymoon' belongs uniquely to them, meaning fathers can feel left out (file photo) 'Fathers can of course - and do - support mums by taking care of the house, shopping etc and this is fantastic. But the fundamental bonding time that is taking place is largely between mum and baby and I don't think we should be afraid of saying this. 'I think that it would be great if dads could have more flexible time off after birth - I understand in Australia for example they can take the paternity leave at any time in the first year which makes a lot more sense. 'I'm just not convinced that, if we are saying that dads can only have four weeks off, that weeks two to four are the best time for them to take this leave.' Acknowledging Jonathan's point that mothers may need extra support after a caesarean birth or if they are struggling with post natal depression, or feeling overwhelmed, she said: 'Mothers are still going to struggle if dad has four weeks off and then returns to work. 'What is needed for these women - and ALL women - is better support: better preparation for motherhood, better birth experiences, better follow-up from midwives (and this means more midwives) and better support networks around them.' Fathers are especially needed when a couple has more than one child following a new arrival (file photo) Milli wrote her thought-provoking piece in response to\u00a0Labour leader Ed Miliband's announcement that his party would increase paternity pay to \u00a3260-a-week, the equivalent of the minimum wage, so more working fathers can afford to take time off. The father-of-two believes more dads want to play a hands-on role in childcare but are 'frustrated by out-dated laws and entitlements'. Jonathan admits he would have been unlikely to take four weeks paternity leave had it been available when his children were born because it would have meant they had less money coming in. But he thinks it's important fathers have the option. 'The choice should be there. Fathers spending more time with their children can only be a good thing,' he said. 'Many fathers won't take a month off because of finances and the pressure from colleagues to return to work. We need a cultural change so a father taking a month off after his child is born isn't unusual.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Milli Hill's comments on paternity leave, arguing that newborns mainly need their mothers, have sparked controversy.

Bulgarian international Dimitar Berbatov now plays for AS Monaco and scored the second goal in the French Ligue 1 side's shock 3-1 win in the last 16, first leg tie Wednesday. On a night of upsets, Hakan Calhanoglu's sublime second half strike gave Bayer Leverkusen a 1-0 home leg win over last season's finalists Atletico Madrid. Spanish title holder Atletico also had Tiago sent off for a second yellow card late in the game and saw an equalizing effort from substitute Fernando Torres chalked off because it was ruled the ball had gone out of play before he scored. Tiago had been denied by home keeper Bernd Leno in the best chance of the match for the visitors. Its coach Diego Simeone summed up the match but still believes his team has a fighting chance of progressing. \"We each had a clear chance, they took theirs and we didn't. It could have been a worse result,\" he said. English Premier League Arsenal was a strong favorite to progress when the draw for the knockout stage was made, but Monaco absorbed early pressure before going ahead just before halftime from a counterattack. Joao Moutinho found Geoffrey Kondogbia, whose fierce shot took a slight deflection off Per Mertesacker and flew past David Ospina in the Gunners goal. German international Mertesacker was at fault for the second just after the break as he was caught out of position and allowed  Anthony Martial to find Berbatov. The striker, who played for Manchester United and Fulham after leaving Tottenham, controlled the pass instantly before firing an unstoppable shot high into the net. Trailing 2-0 Arsenal desperately sought a reply and both Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck were guilty of glaring misses in front of goal. Monaco also remained a threat on the break and Berbatov and the excellent Moutinho combined to set up Martial for a chance which Ospina blocked. Arsenal was given late hope when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored in injury time with a curling strike from just outside the penalty area. But its chances of going through took a nosedive when Oxlade-Chamberlain turned from hero to culprit when he lost the ball on the halfway line. Winger Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco, who had come on as a late substitute for Berbatov, raced clear and scored with an emphatic strike. It left it a desperately disappointing night for Arsenal and its manager Arsene Wenger, who forged his reputation as manager of Monaco before coming to the English Premier League. And prospects for the second leg scarcely look any better, with Monaco having an excellent defensive record in the Champions League and holding three away goals. \"We are confident in our ability and we deserved to win,\" Berbatov told Sky Sports. \"We wanted to win more than them and were fighting all over the pitch,\" added the 34-year-old veteran. Wenger admitted that his team face an uphill battle to reach the quarterfinals with the handicap of a two-goal deficit. \"The task is massive now, the third goal makes it even more difficult but we will have a go.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "AS Monaco, with Dimitar Berbatov, beat Arsenal 3-1 in the Champions League last 16's first leg.

Harry's day had started more than six hours earlier with an appearance at a coaching session run by Inspire Suffolk, a charity that aims to help under-privileged children. Asked to join in, the prince obliged with alacrity but typically, pulled out all the stops to win a penalty shoot out against a group of excited Suffolk school children. Lights, camera... Prince Harry looked on suave form, despite the miserable weather, and stopped to pose for a photo with one young fan - and his flock of sheep . Royal inspection: Prince Harry cuddles up to one of the sheep being paraded around the ring during the Suffolk Show near Ipswich . Cosy chat: Prince Harry stops for a chat with one slightly overwhelmed young fan who stood proudly waiting to greet the prince with his prize-winning sheep .

After inspecting the livestock, Prince Harry then continued on to the food tents, where he met children busily preparing pizzas . Cooking lesson: The prince beamed as he listened to instructions from the class teacher - perhaps a handy hint for future use at Kensington Palace . Grinning from between the goal posts, the prince took his goal-keeping duties seriously, ensuring that not one of the children lined up against him managed to score their penalty. Despite his antics, nothing could dampen the children's enthusiasm, with his pint-sized opponents describing the royal visitor as a 'funny' chap who 'kept making lots of jokes'. Harry, who . is fresh from a successful three-day tour of Estonia and Italy, . impressed local children with his talent for touch rugby and even took . part in a game of football, although soon found himself on the receiving . end of a powerful tackle. 'He tackled me and won the ball but I managed to tackle him back,' revealed nine-year-old Aryon Tandel, from Ipswich. 'He was taking it quite seriously.' So that's how it's done! Prince Harry and a new young friend discuss the perfect toppings for a pizza - in this case mozarella, tomatoes, mushrooms and herbs .

Prince Harry uses his body to block the pint-sized goal during a penalty shootout in which not one got past him . Limbering up: The prince prepares for the first penalty while taking part in a shoot out during a visit to a coaching session for children near Ipswich in Suffolk . Not getting past me! The prince concentrates intently as a ball booted by one of the young players comes whizzing towards his nose . Got it! Prince Harry stretches out a long leg and hooks the incoming ball away from his goal, knocking it safely into a far flung corner of the field . Ducking and diving: Prince Harry seemed to be enjoying himself during his stint in goal - during which not one ball slipped past him . Another young fan, Brandon Norman, eight, from Ipswich, managed to score a goal against Harry's team - much to his delight. 'He gave me a tap around the ear and said well done,' said the delighted boy. The prince - who met the children during a . visit to Inspire Suffolk, a community project in Ipswich - is the vice patron . of the Rugby Football Union, and also took part in a game of rugby - which he took just as seriously as he did the football. 'He was funny and making lots of jokes,' revealed one nine-year-old opponent, George Hill from Ipswich. 'He told me I had to stay behind the ball and joked that if I went in . front again he would slap me!' Equally . impressed was 11-year-old Jake Katz Roberts from Islington in north . London, who was one of the few who managed to evade one of the prince's . lunging tackles. 'He told me: \"That's the last time you're going to skin me,\" revealed the young rugby player, adding: 'Harry was really fun and got stuck in.' Near miss: The royal flinches as a flying ball comes flying straight towards his head but (right) ends up sighing with relief after catching the ball . Nervous?

And while the disease typically dies on surfaces within hours, research has discovered it can survive for more than seven weeks under certain conditions. During tests, the UK\u2019s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) found that the Zaire strain will live on samples stored on glass at low temperatures for as long as 50 days. The left-hand charts plot survival rates of Zaire strain of Ebola (Zebov) and Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Marv) on glass (a) and plastic (b) at 4\u00b0 (39\u00b0F) over 14 days. The right-hand charts reveal the survival rate under the same conditions over 50 days. Both viruses survived for 26 days, and Ebola was extracted after 50 days . The tests were initially carried out by researchers from DSTL\u00a0before the current outbreak, in 2010, but the strain investigated is one of five that is still infecting people globally. The findings are also quoted in advice from the Public Agency of Health in Canada. Ebola was discovered in 1976 and is a member of the Filoviridae family. This family includes the Zaire ebolavirus (Zebov), which was first identified in 1976 and is the most virulent; Sudan ebolavirus, (Sebov); Tai Forest ebolavirus; Ebola-Reston (Rebov), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bebov) - the most recent species, discovered in 2008. For their 2010 paper, \u2018The survival of filoviruses in liquids, on solid substrates and in a dynamic aerosol\u2019, the UK\u2019s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL)  tested two particular filoviruses on a variety of surfaces. These were the Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Marv), and Zaire ebolavirus (Zebov). Each was placed into guinea pig tissue samples and tested for their ability to survive in different liquids and on different surfaces at different temperatures, over a 50-day period. When stored at 4\u00b0 (39\u00b0F), by day 26, viruses from three of the samples were successfully extracted; Zebov on the glass sample, and Marv on both glass and plastic. By day 50, the only sample from which the virus could be recovered was the Zebov from tissue on glass. For their 2010 paper, \u2018The survival of filoviruses in liquids, on solid substrates and in a dynamic aerosol\u2019, Sophie Smither and her colleagues tested two particular filoviruses on a variety of surfaces. These were the Lake Victoria marburgvirus (Marv), and Zebov. Each was placed into guinea pig tissue samples and tested for their ability to survive in different liquids, and on different surfaces at different temperatures, over a 50-day period.

By day 50, the only sample from which the virus could be recovered was the Zebov from tissue on glass. \u2018This study has demonstrated that \ufb01loviruses are able to survive and remain infectious, for extended periods when suspended within liquid and dried onto surfaces,\u2019 explained the researchers. \u2018Data from this study extend the knowledge on the survival of filoviruses under different conditions and provide a basis with which to inform risk assessments and manage exposure.\u2019 The researchers do stress that these tests were carried out in a controlled lab environment, and not in the real world, but published their findings to highlight the survival rates. Last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its Ebola guidelines following the rise in infections. Ebola (pictured) was discovered in 1976 and is a member of the Filoviridae family. This family includes the Zaire ebolavirus (Zebov), which was first identified in 1976 and is the most virulent; Sudan ebolavirus, (Sebov); Tai Forest ebolavirus; Ebola-Reston (Rebov), and Bundibugyo ebolavirus (Bebov) The centre explained that Ebola is not spread through the air, water, or food and a person infected with Ebola can\u2019t spread the disease until symptoms appear. The time from exposure to when signs or symptoms of the disease appear, known as the incubation period, is two to 21 days, but the average time is eight to 10 days. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention advises: . \u2022 DO wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. \u2022 Do NOT touch the blood or body fluids (like urine, feces, saliva, vomit, sweat, and semen) of people who are sick. \u2022 Do NOT handle items that may have come in contact with a sick person\u2019s blood or body fluids, like clothes, bedding, needles,or medical equipment. \u2022 Do NOT touch the body of someone who has died of Ebola. Ebola is spread through direct contact, through broken skin or through\u00a0eyes, nose, or mouth, via blood and body fluids of a person who is sick with Ebola, or objects, such as needles, that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with Ebola. Signs of Ebola include fever and symptoms like severe headache, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or unexplained bleeding or bruising. Dr Tom Fletcher of the Royal Army Medical Corps, who has treated victims in Guinea and Sierra Leone, says: \u2018The initial symptoms are quite non-specific and similar to a flu-like illness. 'They include fever, headache and lethargy. This progresses to severe diarrhoea and vomiting.\u2019 Officials have emphasised there is no risk of transmission from people who have been exposed to the virus, but are not yet showing symptoms. But, specialists at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta found that the virus is present on a patient\u2019s skin after symptoms develop, underlining how contagious the disease is once symptoms set in. According to the CDC, the virus can survive for a few hours on dry surfaces like doorknobs and countertops and can survive for several days in puddles or other collections of body fluid. However, bleach solutions, including household bleach, can kill it. Ebola is only spread through direct contact, through broken skin or through eyes, nose, or mouth, via blood and body fluids of a person who is sick with Ebola, or objects, such as needles, that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with Ebola. It can be killed using bleach . There is no FDA-approved vaccine available for Ebola, but experimental vaccines and treatments for Ebola are under development. The CDC advises people wash their hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser, to protect themselves. It warns to not touch the blood or body fluids, including urine, faeces, saliva, vomit, sweat, and semen of people who are sick. Ebola was once thought to originated in gorillas, because human outbreaks began after people ate gorilla meat. But scientists now believe that bats are the natural reservoir for the virus, and that apes and humans catch it from eating food that bats have drooled or defecated on, or by coming in contact with surfaces covered in infected bat droppings and then touching their eyes or mouths. The current outbreak seems to have started in a village near Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, Guinea, where bat hunting is common, according to Doctors Without Borders.

(AP Photo/Ron Edmonds, File) First trip: President Barack Obama is seen here with Prince Charles, center, and former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, right, at the 65 anniversary D-Day celebration in 2009 . France's President Nicolas Sarkozy (second from left) speaks with U.S. President Barack Obama, as they walk in front of Britain's Prince Charles (left), Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper (third from left) and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown (second from right) at Colleville-sur-Mer cemetery  before a ceremony to mark the 65th anniversary of D-Day on June 6, 2009 . Before him, presidents acknowledged the D-Day invasion with words or statements, but none made a pilgrimage to the site, not even Dwight Eisenhower, who had been the Supreme Allied Commander who ordered the invasion. Here is a sampling of how presidents observed the key D-Day anniversaries. DWIGHT EISENHOWER, 10th anniversary, 1954 . Issued a statement that reflected the Cold War chasm of the day: 'We see peoples, once bitter enemies, burying their antagonisms and joining together to meet the problems of the postwar world. If all those nations which were members of the Grand Alliance have not maintained in time of peace the spirit of that wartime union, if some of the peoples who were our comrades-in-arms have been kept apart from us, that is cause for profound regret, but not for despair.' Eisenhower did go to Normandy after his presidency, for the 20th anniversary observance. Former President Bill Clinton was in Normandy in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of the invasion of France . Former President George W. Bush, whose father is a World War II hero, went to Normandy for the 60th anniversary commemoration in 2004 . LYNDON JOHNSON, 20th anniversary, 1964 . Johnson, in Washington pushing for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, delivered remarks to members of a D-Day delegation, headed by Gen. Omar Bradley: 'Your country remembers and will never forget, the resolve born on that D-Day, that, so long as we are able, and other men are willing to stand together, we shall not permit the light of freedom to be extinguished on any continent again. ... So let all the world know that when this nation has stood 2,000 years we shall not have forgotten the lands where our sons lie buried, nor the cause for which our sons died. Where we have commitments to the cause of freedom, we shall honor them \u2014 today, tomorrow and always.' RICHARD NIXON, 30th anniversary, 1974 . Nixon, in the throes of the Watergate investigation and with impeachment hearings underway, sent General Bradley once again to the ceremonies. Five years earlier, Nixon had issued a proclamation on the 25th anniversary calling the Normandy assault 'a historical landmark in the history of freedom.' He also met at the White House with former war correspondents who were on their way to France for the 25th anniversary observance. Preparations and atmosphere for the Normandy D-Day landings 70th anniversary are seen in Arromanches Le Bain, France . 91-year-old U.S. veteran Edward Tierney from Brock Berry, Connecticut, who landed on June 14, 1944 is seen here signing an autograph for two young reenactors . RONALD REAGAN, 40TH anniversary, 1984 . Reagan spoke at the top of the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc, the Atlantic Ocean spread behind him and with 62 gray-haired surviving Rangers seated before him. 'They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing. Soon, one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five came here. After two days of fighting, only 90 could still bear arms. 'Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the men who put them there.' BILL CLINTON, 50th anniversary, 1994 . Clinton attended the 50th anniversary, delivering his remarks at the U.S. Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France. His comments offer an ironic reference point to the Europe that Obama faces as he arrives in Normandy on Friday. 'Fifty years later, what a different world we live in. Germany, Japan and Italy, liberated by our victory, now stand among our closest allies and the staunchest defenders of freedom. Russia, decimated during the war and frozen afterward in communism and cold war, has been reborn in democracy. 'And as freedom rings from Prague to Kiev, the liberation of this continent is nearly complete. Now the question falls to our generation: How will we build upon the sacrifice of D-Day's heroes? Like the soldiers of Omaha Beach, we cannot stand still. We cannot stay safe by doing so. Avoiding today's problems would be our own generation's appeasements. For just as freedom has a price, it also has a purpose, and its name is progress.' American veteran Frederick Carrier reads the names of soldiers who died landing on Utah Beach at Saint Marie du Mont . GEORGE W. BUSH, 60th anniversary, 2004 . Bush went to Normandy in 2002 to observe Memorial Day. He returned for the 60th anniversary, speaking at the U.S. cemetery and accompanied by French President Jacques Chirac. 'All who are buried and named in this place are held in the loving memory of America. We pray in the peace of this cemetery that they have reached the far shore of God's mercy. And we still look with pride on the men of D-Day, on those who served and went on. It is a strange turn of history that called on young men from the prairie towns and city streets of America to cross an ocean and throw back the marching, mechanized evils of fascism.' BARACK OBAMA, 65th anniversary, 2009 . Obama recalled that his grandfather, a 26-year-old supply sergeant stationed near the English Channel, crossed the channel six weeks after D-Day and followed allied forces across France. 'At an hour of maximum danger, amid the bleakest of circumstances, men who thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do something extraordinary. ... That is the story of Normandy \u2014 but also the story of America; of the Minutemen who gathered on a green in Lexington; of the Union boys from Maine who repelled a charge at Gettysburg; of the men who gave their last full measure of devotion at Inchon and Khe San; of all the young men and women whose valor and goodness still carry forward this legacy of service and sacrifice.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Obama, unique in attending two D-Day anniversaries in Normandy, continued a tradition involving Reagan, Eisenhower, Clinton, and Bush.

And in theory, any carbon-based liquid fuel could be engineered from the process.

So, if you're just staring at your walls, drowning in fear that the great Tom Hanks may never release a digital typewriter app for your iPad, then this one is for you. Because it finally exists. I'm just not exactly sure why. But, the new Hanx Writer app definitely looks, acts, and sounds just like a real typewriter, all nestled within the technological convenience of your amazing, space-age digital tablet. The one you bought to replace your laptop. Which you bought to replace your desktop. Which we all bought to replace our typewriters when we realized we were living in the '80s and didn't have to deal with this crap anymore. Speaking of which, did you know the decline of typewriters can directly be traced to the rise of the British pop music duo, Wham!. Coincidence? Yes. Totally. Completely. It's just that I sort of got sucked into an Internet information wormhole, and that was my major takeaway. Typewriters went out. Wham! came in. Serious journalism. Anyway, I really don't mean to be critical of anyone's interest in outdated typewriters. Or even modern, pretend digital typewriters. After all, both are great if you enjoy that warm, old-world feel of seemingly irreversible mistakes. \"Dave, you misspelled seven words.\" \"Whatever. It's not like it's the Torah.\" \"No, it's your resume.\" As for me, it's just too much trouble. I'm simply not hipster enough to fully appreciate a device that somehow makes it more difficult to write 700 words about not wearing pants. That kind of art requires only the very best modern technology. And a weird childhood. But long-form writing really isn't the point of the Hanx Writer, for it serves a completely different purpose. Digital nostalgia. And it's a hit. As I'm writing this on Thursday night, the Hanx Writer sits proudly as the No. 1 free iPad app in the iTunes store. Behold! The awesome power of Tom Hanks! He managed to take something from your parents' garage, and put it right on your iPad. But what I really find funny is the iTunes category: Productivity. Sorry, Mr. Hanks. I do appreciate the inventiveness of your app and your passion for the medium, however let's not kid ourselves. It's anything but productive. Unless, of course, your goal for the day is to make multiple spelling and punctuation mistakes. In which case, it\" s f&9#ing greatgdzfg!.; . To be fair, it does have a few necessary conveniences, like a setting which allows you to use \"modern delete.\" It also provides for copy-paste. So, it's sort of a combination of old and new. Users can enjoy the feeling of a typewriter while still processing words digitally. The idea is that what you make will feel to you, and look to your reader, like something more personal than an e-mail or a text message. And Hanks argues that kind of personalization shines best through a typewriter. Even a digital one. The Oscar-winning actor is actually a huge aficionado of typewriters. A year ago, he even wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about why he loves them so much. Amazingly, Hanks says he uses a manual typewriter almost every day. He wrote: \"Everything you type on a typewriter sounds grand, the words forming in mini-explosions of SHOOK SHOOK SHOOK. A thank-you note resonates with the same heft as a literary masterpiece.\" Maybe so. \"Sarah, thanks for being my beautiful maid of honor on such a special day for me and Brad. I'm sorry you threw up in the hotel lobby.\" And maybe not. Now, for what it's worth, this column was crafted (ha!) over the span of two days using two different computers. During that time, I paused to read more of Hanks' op-ed. And, despite my earlier cynicism, I admit that I now better understand the appeal. Dammit, Tom Hanks. Why do you have to be so charming? So, yeah, I'm sort of sold on the idea that an old typewriter might tap into your creativity in a different way. Which is why they put a lot of thought into making this app. Pulling from Hanks' vast personal collection, the app's developer, Hitcents, created several totally original vintage-style typewriter choices. One of these comes standard with the app. The others are available for purchase. And each types with a completely different style. With the help of Hanks, they literally studied the ink patterns of these old typewriters, and digitally recreated the typefaces within the app. Thus, if you're not working on anything too serious as a final draft, and if you want to explore your creativity and communication in a different, perhaps even more personal, way, the Hanx Writer might just be the app for you. Maybe so. \"Sarah, we just got a bill from the hotel.\" And maybe not. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.

Youk Chhang runs the Documentation Center of Cambodia, which has documented 20,000 mass graves. He was 13 when the Khmer Rouge came to power. Separated from his family, forced into slave labor, beaten nearly to death for stealing rice for his pregnant sister, he saw the horrors firsthand. His mother lost a daughter and four siblings; 30 years later she still searches for them, hoping they survived. Chhang survived by eating whatever he could find. After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, it took him months to walk home to his family. Eventually, he fled to safety in the United States. \"Food was ... more important than God,\" Chhang said. \"I always wish to have a bowl of rice. And one good night's sleep. That's all I wanted. I would do anything for it.\"  Watch Youk Chhang talk about what he ate, how he survived \u00bb . But the ghosts of the genocide brought Chhang back to Cambodia. And for more than a decade, he has run the Documentation Center of Cambodia. \"DC-Cam,\" as it is known, is the world's largest repository of information about the Cambodian genocide. It holds hundreds of thousands of documents, photos and films as well as interviews with both survivors and former Khmer Rouge members. Chhang said he believes the Khmer Rouge kept such careful records as a measure of their success -- a trophy of sorts. \"At each time when they kill a person, they document it so that they can measure their success one step forward,\" Chhang said. \"If they kill two, then two step forward. If they kill five, then five step forward. So to them, it's a golden file. But I mean, to us it's crime against humanity.\" DC-Cam has located and mapped nearly 200 prisons and 20,000 mass graves across the country. For Chhang and DC-Cam, the work is critical to preserving memory and promoting justice.  Watch as Chhang takes CNN's Christiane Amanpour into DC-Cam's secured vault \u00bb . Today in Cambodia, a tribunal is under way to try five of the surviving leaders of the Khmer Rouge -- 30 years after their alleged crimes. DC-Cam is providing much of the evidence for use in the trial, evidence that makes plain the facts of the genocide, the scope of the losses and the personal and national grief. Chhang said he hopes the tribunal will help Cambodians move forward -- and help heal the nation he loves. But even now, the way forward is difficult. Chhang has dedicated a lifetime of work, research, preservation and advocacy to his mother, whose bravery and sacrifice inspired him. Even though his mother survived and they shared much of the same pain and many of the same losses, the two do not talk about what happened. Some in Cambodia are anxious to forget and forgive. Others are angry and searching for justice. Many, like Chhang, said that only by knowing, exploring and exposing the truth will Cambodia be able to rectify its past -- and secure a healthy future."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Youk Chhang, a survivor of the Khmer Rouge's reign, runs DC-Cam, documenting 20,000 mass graves.

Arriving to the US a young, idealistic student, Lawal has carved a name for himself in one of the most competitive industries in the world: Oil. Now head of a multi-billion dollar empire, his Houston-based company, CAMAC, is one of the largest black-owned businesses in the U.S., generating over $2 billion dollars a year. Founded nearly 25 years ago, Lawal built CAMAC (which stands for Cameroon-American) from a small agriculture business into a global oil company. But it's taken a lot of hard work, determination and guts to get him to the top. Born and raised in Ibadan, Nigeria in 1954, Lawal became interested in America and its civil rights movement during his teens. After finally persuading his father, a local politician, to send him to university in America, Lawal headed to Georgia and then Houston, where he attended the Texas Southern University. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering in 1976, Lawal, like many of his classmates, started out as a graduate in the energy industry. First as a chemist for Dresser Industries (now Halliburton) and then as a chemical engineer with Shell Oil Refining Co. During this time he met his wife, Eileen through a mutual friend and had his three children. Now married and settled, it wasn't long before the innovative young Nigerian started to implement his business ideas. In 1986 he established CAMAC, a company trading agricultural commodities such as sugar, tobacco and rice. In the early 90s he made the leap into the energy sector after the Nigerian government started to develop its energy market. With his knowledge of Nigeria and his Houston address, Lawal was ideally positioned to attract major oil companies. In 1991 CAMAC made a deal with the oil giant Conoco, agreeing to jointly operate and share production from any Nigerian discoveries. This turned out to be Lawal's big break. With his political contacts, local market knowledge and now with the backing of a major oil firm, Lawal's Houston-based company became an instant player in the energy industry. As Lawal told CNN: \"That partnership I believe was the cornerstone of the CAMAC that you know today. Subsequently with that credibility and the advantage of partnering with Conoco, we were also able to partner with BP and also with Statoil of Norway and currently we have made a partnership with Eni, the largest Italian company, which is one of the top five oil companies in the world.\" Now CAMAC has offices in London, Johannesburg, Lagos and Port Harcourt, Nigeria and is involved in oil exploration, refining and trading. He was awarded the USAfrica Business Person of the Year in 1997 and in 2002 CAMAC was named the largest African-American owned company on the Black Enterprise 100s list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Kase Lawal, a Nigerian-born entrepreneur, founded CAMAC, initially an agricultural commodities trading company.

The female mind has always been a complete mystery to most men and their enigmatic thoughts and actions almost impossible to decode - until now. Finally the closely-held secret of whether a woman fancies someone has been exposed and experts have found it is all in the eyes. A new study looked at how and where women glance after a man makes initial eye contact and found this shows him all he needs to know about his chances of romance. Great news! Life coach Ali Campbell says that if a woman looks down and sweeps the floor with her eyes, left, or looks to the side and then back it is a sure sign she fancies a man . What happens in the 45 seconds after . meeting makes it crystal clear if love is in the air or whether the . hapless male suitor will get the cold shoulder, experts have said. About turn: A woman looking sideways was often thought to be a rejection but research has found that in fact she is attracted to you . Life coach Ali Campbell says in his book 'More than Just Sex' that the look men want to see is her looking down and then moving her eyes in a sweeping motion across the floor because it almost certainly means that she is attracted to you. This glance means that she is checking her internal emotions, in short, she likes you but is working out how much. 'It's the . holy grail of looks,' he said. 'If a guy can pick up on that he has a sure-fire way to work out if she is interested.' And in a complete reversal the . disinterested, shy or bashful look sideways a woman often gives is not . the brush-off most men thought it was. It is in fact the opposite. If a woman looks away for up to 45 . seconds and then stares you . straight in the eye it is another sure sign that she is interested . because she is thinking hard about whether you are a suitable partner. 'Most guys have the idea that if they make eye contact and she looks away she is not interested. But she will look away, that's inevitable. That's what happens when we think to ourselves and also consider our feelings,' Mr Campbell told MailOnline. 'I have interviewed literally hundreds of women and too many men concentrate on having the right car, the right watch, the right whatever. But it is rubbish, all the women I spoke to told me they are just interested in what men are like inside. 'What I am doing for guys is to make sure they know there is someone out there who is interested in you. The important thing is to show who you really are.' But of course with good news there is . bad and this book has also given men the clearest indications yet about . whether they have no chance of love with someone they like. If . after the man makes eye contact she instantly looks over his head or . stares straight back at him it is almost certainly curtains. Forget it: An aggressive stare, left, or looking up or over a man's head is not good news and experts say a man is best to turn his attention elsewhere . These two 'aggressive' reactions mean the man should back off quickly and turn his attentions elsewhere to avoid further embarrassment. 'You do not want her to stare you out or look over your head. That's a bad sign,' he said. Mr Campbell's study has also found women . give off other signals that men should look out for on a date or when . they meet someone for the first time. Secret: The book has revealed a whole new world to men which they can use to know if a date is going well or not .

A big-shot Hollywood producer who for decades was working as an Israeli spy and arms dealer has defended his actions and said it was 'exciting' being his country's 'James Bond.' Arnon Milchan, 68, who's famous for smash hit movies including 'Fight Club' and 'Pretty Woman,' spoke openly for the first time about his espionage work in an Israeli TV special that aired Monday night. The program reveals Milchan, at the special request of his friend Shimon Peres, who is now the country's president' set up and operated some 30 companies in 17 countries that helped Israel obtain parts and plans for its nuclear project in the 1980s. He brokered deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the show. 'I did it for my country and I'm proud of it,' Milchan said of his work for Israel's now-defunct spy unit Bureau of Scientific Relations. 'Do you know what it was like to be a 20-something guy whose country decided to let him be James Bond? Wow! The action! That was exciting.' The film tycoon spoke to Israeli investigative journalist Ilana Dayan for the season premiere of her current affairs show, Uvda. Milchan was born in 1944 in what was then Palestine but was a successful young businessman in the United States when Peres, then in the defense department, recruited him to help following the 1973 Yom Kippur War.

Israeli spy officials used bank . accounts set up by Milchan to buy up helicopters and missiles and other . defense equipment from around the world, Dayan said. Milchan, the multi-billionaire . chairman of New Regency Productions, explains in the program how he also convinced a .

When the FBI discovered one of his . companies was used to ship nuclear triggers to Israel without proper . licenses in 1985, an executive who was involved was indicted. But charges against Milchan were dropped by the Reagan administration. 'I didn't know Israel ordered the triggers,' Milchan told the program. 'I didn't even know what triggers were.'

Lamine Diack, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, has called for Russian law to be respected ahead of his sport's world championships, which begin in Moscow on Saturday. Russian President Vladimir Putin last month signed into effect a law which bars the public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear. It has been condemned by Russian and international rights groups as highly discriminatory. \"I don't feel there is a problem whatsoever,\" Diack, a member of the International Olympic Committee, told reporters. \"Russia has their laws. Each athlete can have their own private life, so we won't call upon people about this and that. \"This law has to be respected. We are here for the World Championships and have no problem whatsoever and I'm not worried at all.\" The new laws have led to calls for the 2014 Winter Olympics, set to be held in the city of Sochi, to be taken away from Russia. A 320,000-signature petition protesting the country's stance on gay rights ahead of the Games was presented to Olympic bosses in Switzerland on Wednesday. Responding to the petition, International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Jacques Rogge reaffirmed the Olympic movement's commitment to freedom of expression. \"The Olympic charter is clear. A sport is a human right and it should be available to all, regardless of race, sex or sexual orientation,\" said Rogge in a statement. \" As far as the freedom of expression is concerned, of course, this is something that is important.\" According to the IOC's statement, the Russian government has confirmed the new legislation will not apply to athletes and tourists during the Games. \"This legislation has just been passed into law and it remains to be seen whether and how it will be implemented, particularly as regards the Games in Sochi. \"As a sporting organization, what we can do is to continue to work to ensure that the Games can take place without discrimination against athletes, officials, spectators and the media. \"To that end, the IOC has received assurances from the highest level of government in Russia that the legislation will not affect those attending or taking part in the Games.\" Rogge's words were welcomed by All Out, the gay rights group which delivered the petition to the IOC's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. \"This is the strongest and most direct statement we have received from the IOC,\"All Out co-founder and executive director Andre Banks said in a statement. \"It shows the IOC is listening to the global outcry against these laws and demanding real answers, not propaganda, from the Russian government. \"When he mentions the importance of freedom of expression, Rogge is right. Fundamental freedoms are eroded for all Russians -- gay and straight -- under these laws. \"Pierre de Coubertin created the Games with the dream of 'changing the world through sport'. In that spirit, we are calling for the IOC to clearly denounce the anti-gay law and do everything in its power to see that it is removed before the Olympics.\" Russia's sports minister Vitaly Mutko, speaking at the same press conference as Diack, urged journalists to \"calm down\" before defending the new law. \"In addition to this law, we have a constitution that guarantees all rights to private life,\" insisted Mutko. \"This law is not intended to deprive any people of any religion, of any race, of any sexual orientation, but to ban the promotion of non-traditional relations among the younger generations. \"All sports athletes and organizations should be relaxed. All their rights will be protected. \"You have to respect the laws of the country you are coming to. This is a sports festival and we only have to talk about it.\" U.S. President Barack Obama spoke out on the issue on Tuesday's Jay Leno show, condemning the laws as against the spirit of the Olympics. \"I've been very clear that when it comes to universal rights, when it comes to people's basic freedoms, that whether you are discriminating on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, you are violating the basic morality that I think should transcend every country,\" said Obama. Obama this week canceled a one-on-one meeting with Putin which had been scheduled for September. The reason given by the White House was Russia's decision to grant asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden and \"lack of progress on issues such as missile defense and arms control,\" while also mentioning human rights issues. World Sport Presents: An uneven playing field . In June Obama visited Diack's native Senegal, where homosexuality is illegal. Obama called for all African citizens to be treated equally, but Senegal's president Macky Sall insisted the country is \"not ready\" to decriminalize homosexuality. British broadcaster Stephen Fry penned an open letter to his country's prime minister David Cameron, International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge and London 2012 chief Sebastian Coe calling for the Games to be taken away from Russia. There has been a groundswell of international concern over the anti-gay propaganda law and its potential impact on visitors to Russia for the Games. Protests have ranged from a number of bars around the world announcing a boycott of Russian vodka to calls from some quarters for a boycott of the Games themselves. However, some gay athletes insist the Games must go ahead in Sochi. \"I'm fully against a boycott,\" New Zealand speed skater Blake Skjellerup told CNN. \"The Olympics have been very important to me and I know that a lot of people like myself have worked very hard for these Games. \"It's very important for the world to show up in Sochi and be united in this issue, to bring light to and start a conversation about what is going on.\" U.S. figure skater Johnny Weir, who is married to a Russian-American man, says the flamboyant nature of his sport means that he can make a stance in Sochi. \"I'm quite well known in Russia so my sheer presence is a big statement against this anti-propaganda law,\" he told CNN. Former Olympic diving champion Greg Louganis says it is difficult to balance the sporting desires of athletes with the need to make a political point against the Russian law. \"Boycotts hurt the wrong people, they hurt the athletes, but we can't ignore what's going on in Sochi,\" said the American, who missed the 1980 Moscow Olympics due to a boycott and was also affected by Eastern European retaliation in snubbing the 1984 Los Angeles Games. \"It's a birthright to pursue love and not be incarcerated for loving and wanting to find love,\" he told CNN."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Russia's anti-gay laws have sparked controversy over the 2014 Winter Olympics.

Officer Troy Spencer wrote in his police report that he checked the four lap bars in Theisen's cart several times and found three bars could not be pulled up. But, the fourth bar, where Thiesen was sitting, came unlocked. \u2018It appeared that the lap bar on Seat #1 locking mechanism was stripped.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\n(CNN) -- Jockeys may rely on real live horsepower to help them reach the winning post, but they still train like athletes. When you are riding half a ton of flesh at 40 mph you have to be able to hold your horse. The riders, as well as their runners, follow a strict fitness regime -- and the result is a proven formula for a well-balanced and healthy body. \"Fitness has changed massively from the days when jockeys were just turning up at the races and were drinking,\" flat racing jockey Martin Lane told CNN. \"Now we're at the peak of our fitness. It's definitely not just sitting on a horse!\" In the English town of Newmarket, ex-jockey Richard Perham runs a boot camp for jockeys at the British Racing School. Any budding jockey hoping to gain a license to ride from the British Horseracing Authority now has to pass a fitness assessment laid out by Perham. Getting race fit starts by building the key muscles used to guide the world's speediest steeds to the finish. The legs, lower body and core are the three areas of the body on which jockeys focus in training. Upper body strength is also crucial when it comes to controlling the horse. \"If you looked at a jockey without clothes on, there aren't many who have an ounce of fat underneath the skin,\" Perham told CNN. \"It's literally muscle and bone. Jockeys are incredibly well-toned athletes in the same way that Olympic champions Jessica Ennis or Mo Farah are.\" Racing fit . Jockey training is not for the faint of heart, or those who like a lie-in. Lane trains six days a week -- and only allows himself a rest on Sunday mornings. \"I'm up around half past five or six most mornings,\" the 27-year-old explained. \"I'd then spend two and a half hours riding out. \"Then I'll have a cycle -- I ride 150 miles each week. The aerobic fitness from the cycling is what gets you through the season. \"Before the season starts, I'm at the gym with a personal trainer three mornings a week working on basic strength and a bit of boxing thrown in there as well. \"In the afternoons I go racing, and race riding keeps you pretty fit too.\" Jockeys can also top up their conditioning at the British Racing School's training suite in Newmarket. Here resident fitness coach Yariv Kam, a former basketball player, oversees bleep tests, squats (at the wall and standing on wobble cushions), timed sit-ups, push and pull band exercises and the dreaded plank. All these exercises in some way replicate the crouched racing stance adopted by jockeys -- the so-called \"Martini glass\" position. This precarious pose also asks the riders to summon balancing skills, and this is tested on the \"equisizer\" -- a cross between a rocking horse and a bucking bronco. Complete with a swishing tail and cozy blanket, the equisizer is a lifesize, legless horse which simulates the forwards and backwards rhythm that jolts jockeys during the races. It is used, along with other simulators like Perham's own Rideaway device, to help jockeys stay balanced -- and stay on the horse. \"Balance and fitness are equally important for jockeys but balance must come first,\" explained Perham. \"In the same way that in yoga you need to hold those positions for a period of time, a jockey also needs core stability to maintain his balance.\" One meal a day . Maintaining equilibrium is also important for jockeys when it comes to their weight. They are put under enormous pressure to meet weight requirements. In the U.S. and Great Britain, the minimum riding weight is 53 kg for the leaner flat racing jockeys and 61.5 kg for jump jockeys. The majority are naturally slim and slight, so their fitness regimes do not tend to be focused on weight loss, although the amount of intensive training and riding does help keep off the pounds. \"I'm lucky that I can literally eat whatever I want and I won't get any heavier than 53 kg,\" explained Lane, who started riding when he was 12. \"But some of the other guys struggle with one meal a day. Mentally, it's a big task not to be eating.\" The British Racing School also helps jockeys maintain a balanced diet by offering advice from nutritionists. There is also a jockey cook book which includes calorie-counted recipes such as Mexican beans and rice, and spicy sausage hot pot. Not just about the horse . But, in the same way that motorsport drivers rely on the horsepower of their car engines, aren't jockeys mainly relying on real horsepower to win races? Perham concedes that the work level is split 90% to 10% in favor of the horse. But Lane, who has ridden more than 350 winners, believes jockeys can lose races if they are not physically fit. \"People say, 'It's the horse, you just have to sit there,' but we have proved that fitness definitely comes into it,\" he reasoned. \"It may only be 10% us but if we're only 50% fit then the jockey can only commit 5% of the work during a race. \"If we're not as fit as we can be then we're definitely affecting the horse.\" As an example, he cited last weekend's Shergar Cup, a team event held at Britain's Ascot racecourse where jockeys compete for international teams. \"The English and European jockeys were so much fitter than the jockeys from the rest of the world. You could see at the finish they weren't as strong.\" To show how hard it is to train like a jockey, Perham put World Sport anchor Alex Thomas through his physical tests for CNN's Winning Post show. At the British Racing School, Thomas was unseated on his first ride on the equisizer. He also found he was no match for a professional jockey like Lane. In Perham's fitness assessment, Thomas managed to last 40 seconds in the sit-up test compared to the jockey average of 240 seconds, and while the average rider could stay in the stomach-clenching plank pose for 180 seconds, the journalist managed a third of that time. \"I knew it was going to be hard but I didn't think it would be that tough,\" Thomas grimaced at the end of his grueling physical. \"Safe to say, I won't be applying for my racing license anytime soon!\" All-round fitness . Not everyone has the lean and light physique that is a prerequisite for becoming a jockey, but getting race fit can help anyone become a fitness thoroughbred. \"The tools we use are all based around gym exercises that people do,\" explained Perham. \"The simulator that I've designed is based around preparing jockeys but it's also very, very easily adaptable as a piece of gym equipment, similar to a rowing machine or a cross trainer. It's an all-round fitness tool.\" While following such a training regime might not ultimately help you ride a winner in the Grand National or Breeders' Cup, Lane agrees that the principles of the program have benefits for anyone wanting to get fit. \"It's good for an all-round level of fitness,\" he added. \"Being fit makes everyday life so much easier.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jockeys undergo rigorous training at Richard Perham's boot camp, focusing on key muscles, maintaining strict weight requirements, and following a balanced diet.

'Insider attacks' by Afghan security forces have been on the rise in recent years and have led to the deaths of 142 people. Western troops and civilians training Afghan security forces have faced lethal assaults from Afghans in uniform who turn their guns on their counterparts.

Thursday's attack came after a surge in violence by the Taliban insurgency over the past year.

Most NATO combat troops pulled out of Afghanistan last year but a small contingent of about 12,000 remains in the country, including roughly 10,600 American forces.

Thailand's immigration bureau revoked the visa of Mikhail Pletnev because it believes he poses threats to the country, according to Maj. Gen. Pansak Kasemsan. The development means that even if the charges against Pletnev are eventually dropped, he will be deported from the country. Although the revocation of the visa is already in place, an exception allows him to enter the country while his case is pending. Pletnev was arrested and charged July 6 with raping the teenage boy in the Thai beach town of Pattaya, where he owns a house. The crime carries a maximum prison term of 20 years. The judge released him on a $9,000 bail until the criminal charges against him are resolved, with the provision that he return to the seaside town of Pattaya every 12 days to renew the conditions of the bail. That means Pletnev can travel abroad as long as he continues to make his court dates. Pletnev was in Thailand on Monday and is due back in the country on July 30.

Poor rewards: 60 per cent of travellers think they need to take too many flights before they can redeem Air Miles. British Airways' rewards scheme is largely used only by business flyers .

Support for shops: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles wants to help shoppers and motorists by relaxing parking charges . Drivers could be granted a \u2018grace period\u2019 to park outside the shops for a few minutes without paying, under plans being considered by Eric Pickles. The Local Government secretary said he wanted to end the \u2018war on the motorist\u2019 which is putting people off shopping in their town centres. He said parking charges had become \u2018ridiculously high\u2019 and drivers were being used as \u2018cash cows\u2019 by local councils. Mr Pickles said: \u2018We are looking at more ways to curb ridiculously high parking charges and over-zealous traffic wardens who pounce on those simply popping into their local shop for a pint of milk or to buy a paper. \u2018This overly aggressive stance towards the motorist is not good for the high street. Councils should be supporting their local high streets and wider economy, not using drivers as cash cows.\u2019 Sources in his department said the plans under consideration include limits on how much councils can levy, and \u2018grace periods\u2019 on parking spaces for quick trips to town centres. A few councils already allow drivers to park free for up to 30 minutes near their local shops, but it is understood similar schemes will be implemented more widely. Mr Pickles warned two years ago that town centres had become \u2018ghost towns\u2019 as people were put off shopping there by aggressive parking rules and instead turning to out-of-town supermarkets. His comments chime with the Mary Portas review, an independent report commissioned by the Government into the future of the high street, which stressed that cheap or free parking was key to the local economy. The Department for Communities and Local Government can only issue guidelines to councils, but Mr Pickles said: \u2018We are offering guidance about being reasonable. By and large councils obey guidance.\u2019 Opportunistic: The Local Government secretary said he wanted to end the \u00bfwar on the motorist\u00bf which is putting people off shopping in town . Whitehall planning rules brought in by Labour in 2001 restricted the number of parking spaces in new developments which triggered an increase in parking restrictions. Councils were discouraged from setting lower parking charges to attract more shoppers into town centres. But the Government say this unfairly penalised drivers and instead drove them away. Between 2000 and 2007, average parking charges jumped 40 per cent from 86p for two hours to \u00a31.21. Research has shown that a relatively small increase in the parking charges can result in dramatic fall-offs in visitors to shops. An AA spokesperson said: \u2018It is well documented that when you have high parking charges somewhere people don\u2019t go there, and that has an impact on business and trade. \u2018Some town centres will give you 30 minutes free, so you can go into the bank or drop off a prescription and we think other authorities should see the merit of that. \u2018If it is well controlled, there will be quick turnover of spaces. People say it creates traffic, but you have balance that with the impact on the local economy to get people in to the shops. \u2018They could also follow the example of some other European and build large underground car parks where appropriate. You cannot punish people with pricing. Parking problems: Mr Pickles criticised high parking charges and over-zealous traffic wardens . \u2018Fuel prices are already having a big impact on people using their cars, so any extra charges drive people into out of town shops where parking is free.\u2019 But Peter Box of the Local Government Association said the Government\u2019s own figures show parking charges rose by just 1.25 per cent - less than inflation - over the past two years. He said: \u2018Claims councils are hiking up parking charges to make money off motorists are not borne out by the facts. \u2018Regulating parking is essential to keep traffic flowing, pedestrians and motorists safe, roads clear for emergency services and business deliveries, and ensuring people can park near their homes or local shops. \u2018What works in one town or city might not in another, depending on factors such as population, weight of traffic, road layout, number of car parks and who runs them.

From legendary entertainer Josephine Baker to internationally acclaimed artist Henry Ossawa Tanner to World War I's ragtime-and-jazz-playing \"Harlem Hellfighters,\" Paris has embraced African-American culture like few other places. Because of that legendary embrace -- one that black folks in the States had heard about since the 1800s -- Paris loomed large in their imaginations. To many who didn't always feel welcome in their native country, the city sounded like a place where they could emotionally exhale. \"It's always been about freedom for us,\" says Marcus Bruce, the Benjamin E. Mays Professor of Religious Studies at Bates College and author of \"Henry Ossawa Tanner: A Spiritual Biography.\" He's now researching a book on African-Americans at the worldwide Paris Exposition of 1900 and exploring their Parisian lives in the 19th and 20th centuries. Legendary Harlem-born author James Baldwin, who left for Paris in 1948, said \"African-Americans discover in Paris the terms by which they can define themselves. It's the freedom to work beyond the assumptions of what we can and can't do as African-Americans. It's a different rhythm and pace. We can imagine ourselves in new ways in that space.\" 10 fabulous free finds in Paris . That's where these treks through African-American history come in. Walking the Spirit Tours . Julia Browne launched Walking the Spirit Tours in 1994, and it became the first company to focus specifically on black American history in Paris. Back then, she says, \"I'd contact travel agents in the States and they would say, 'Why would people want to do that?'\" Times have changed for Browne, who is based near Toronto and frequently travels to France to lead tours. For example, Browne's \"Writers, Artists & Intellectuals\" tour traipses through the lively Latin Quarter and chic Saint-Germain-des-Pres. Her guests get to peek inside the Parisian caf\u00e9 where Richard Wright wrote and see the urban landscapes that inspired Boston-born painter Lois Mailou Jones. \"The Entertainers\" tour strolls still-vibrant Montmartre, the quartier where both Josephine Baker and Ada \"Bricktop\" Smith once owned clubs. Snapshots: City of Light -- and love . While 85% of Walking the Spirit tour-goers are African-American, \"We do a lot of school groups from Switzerland, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey and more and more French schools and organizations. It's professors in European universities who are teaching black studies,\" says Browne. \"For African-Americans or black Europeans, it creates a tremendous sense of pride and belonging. \"Paris is not just a foreign city,\" says Browne, a certified France specialist who also offers black history tours elsewhere in France. Browne has hired a 20-something Walking the Spirit tour guide who moved to Paris from the States to pursue a singing career, and her experience in the city \"brings it up to date. People enjoy hearing the real, on-the-ground stories from her.\" A new DVD vividly captures much of what Browne's tours bring to life. In \"When African Americans Came to Paris,\" Browne, award-winning documentarian Joanne Burke, and writer/cameraman David Burke feature six short videos that offer a fascinating, early 20th century look at black Americans in Paris. Walking the Spirit Tours operate year-round, with prices ranging from $60 to $70 per adult, with children up to age 15 half-price. Black Paris Tours . Oakland, California, native and former broadcast journalist Ricki Stevenson fulfilled a lifelong dream of moving to the City of Light, and in 1997 launched Black Paris Tours. Her talk show host roots are obvious as she recounts the experiences of now legendary black American expatriates for guests. With the historic Arc de Triomphe on the famed boulevard Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es as the backdrop for her tour's start, Stevenson uses laminated photos and sketches as props that help bring this brand of American history to light. \"I can do five tours in one week and they won't be the same. It really depends on the people,\" says Stevenson, who like Browne frequently gets university groups from around the world. Her tours also have attracted American celebrities and politicians, including R&B star Brian McKnight and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown. \"It really depends on the level of interest, the level of understanding. I've had professors of African-American history on the same day, and it was just magic.\" As she's done for years, Stevenson punctuates her historical soundtrack with a primer on Parisian protocol: \"How to be polite, what to expect, so that they get into being French for a minute.\" She advises her guests to always greet store owners and clerks with a friendly bonjour or bonsoir when entering and au revoir when leaving; to keep their voices low when on trains and buses and in restaurants. \"They may come as tourists, but I want them to leave as travelers who don't just pick up souvenirs. I try to make that correlation so they understand where they are, what the culture is. \"Having been a travel reporter for six years and traveling all over the world, I want to see where people go to shop. Take me to the 'hood. I want to see us (black Parisians) as much as possible.\" Since spring 2012, one of Black Paris Tours' four guides functions as a \"nightlife coordinator\" for guests who want to experience Paris after dark. This French-speaking guide arranges evenings on the town for guests, handles plans for dining, entertainment and transportation -- and will accompany them on these adventures. Black Paris Tours operate Monday-Friday except during late December and January. Adult tour prices range from \u20ac70 (about $94) for a two-thirds day tour to \u20ac100 (about $134) for a full-day walking-bus tour (doesn't include \u20ac10 lunch). Children from age 5 to 15 are \u20ac30 each. Discounts are available for groups of eight or more. Entr\u00e9e to Black Paris . When Houston native Dr. Monique Y. Wells began leading tours in Paris more than 10 years ago, most of her guests were university study-abroad groups. She still gets them, but Entr\u00e9e to Black Paris now has expanded to offer 12 different African-American history walks, including \"Black History in and Around the Luxembourg Garden\" and \"Montparnasse -- The Artists' World.\" Wells' company specializes in private, guided tours, and her most popular is \"Black Paris After World War II,\" which Wells says offers \"a lot of talk about the entire African-American diaspora experience.\" \"It's important for African-Americans to see there are other race struggles going on in the world,\" says Wells, whose e-book \"Black Paris Profiles,\" shares the stories of 24 black American and Afro-Caribbean folks who reinvented their lives here. \"And for people who are not black and taking the tours -- if they are Americans -- to see just how much the African-American presence has brought to Paris. The Paris they know would not be the same, and it's important for them to understand that.\" Wells mentions jazz, first introduced to France by black Americans. Not only has this music led to a French-grown jazz culture, but \"so much art from the 20th century has been influenced by jazz.\" Culinary contributions also figure into Entr\u00e9e's year-round tours. \"When I moved here, you could not find sweet potatoes on mainstream menus,\" says Wells, a co-author of \"Food for the Soul: A Texas Expatriate Nurtures Her Culinary Roots in Paris.\" Now, she says, this African-American Southern food staple is everywhere -- and served thinly sliced and fried as a bite-sized hors d'oeuvre or soup garnish. Passionate about helping tourists explore French culture through food, Wells this month will start joining Jacksonville, Florida-based Chef Amadeus for \"The Southern Passion Lounge in Paris,\" an Internet radio show. Broadcast the third Thursday of each month at 1 p.m. ET, they'll transport listeners to Parisian eateries through food, wine and music -- and also will spotlight French restaurants and chefs in the States.

Worryingly for the Government, the figures showed there had actually been a decline in the number of children involved in sport across all age groups over the past five years. A report published in The Daily Telegraph claimed 25 per cent of girls aged between five and 10 had not participated in a sport in the past month - an increase of 17 per cent on the figure five years ago. One in seven boys of the same age had not participated either. And the number of children doing gymnastics, playing rounders or going swimming has also fallen away.

International tourism to Mexico has increased 2.1% in the first five months of 2011 compared to 2010, and it remains the top destination for Americans traveling abroad. Statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce show that fewer Americans are traveling abroad, but a bigger percentage of those who do are going to Mexico. Mexico also reported double-digit increases in the percentage of visitors from Russia, Brazil and China, among others. \"The data doesn't lie,\" Mexico's deputy secretary for tourism, Ricardo Anaya, told CNN. \"Tourists keep choosing Mexico.\" The unrelenting battles between rival drug cartels and police and cartels have provided nearly unlimited fodder for those who write off Mexico as a dangerous destination. The truth, Anaya said, is that the violence is limited to certain geographic areas that can be avoided by tourists. The border area, for example, where much violence has been recorded, is 1,200 miles from the resort town of Cancun -- that's like avoiding travel to Houston because of problems in New York, he said. According to surveys by Mexican tourism authorities, 98% of those who do visit Mexico say they will come back, and 99% recommend it to others. Opinion: Why you should go to Mexico . Much of the growth has been fueled by new programs to incentivize tourists from emerging economies, such as the so-called BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China. For starters, Mexico began allowing holders of U.S. visas to enter Mexico, opening up the possibility of tourists to the United States extending their trips south of the border. Also, Brazilians, Russians and Ukrainian visitors can gain travel permission to Mexico on the Internet, with no need for a visa. Finally, for travelers from other countries, visas to Mexico in many cases can be obtained through a travel agent, erasing the need for trips to embassies. In 2011 to date, Mexico has seen a 40.9% increase in Brazilian tourists, a 58.1% increase from Russia and 32.8% increase from China, according to Mexico's tourism ministry. For U.S. travelers specifically, the Commerce Department's most recent data -- for 2009 -- shows that 31.7% of all U.S. international tourists go to Mexico. From 2002 to 2009, while U.S. tourism to Canada fell by more than 27%, tourism to Mexico from the U.S. increased by 5.1%. This happened even though the overall number of Americans traveling abroad decreased, from a peak of 64 million in 2007 to 61.4 million in 2009. When Kendra Young, a high school teacher in Texas, told her friends that she and her husband's family were going to Cozumel for a yearly retreat, she was met with skepticism. Are you worried, they would ask? Are you still going? \"I think people see all of Mexico as one entity,\" she told CNN. It was the third straight year that she traveled to the same resort, and security was not a concern for her. Young is pregnant, and she was more worried about food-borne or water-borne illness. She was aware of several State Department travel warnings to Mexico's cartel hot spots, but she also knew that the area she was traveling to was not affected. Her group planned to stay on the resort, where they felt safest, but on the advice of resort staff they trusted from the previous trips, they ventured into the city without worries. \"Unfortunately, there are the headline-grabbing things -- the drugs, the violence -- but I don't think that's indicative of what's happening in the entire country,\" Young said. Anaya pointed out that Americans are not unaware of the violence -- 80% of Americans who travel to Mexico go to six places, none of which have had travel alerts. The destinations are Cozumel, Riviera Maya, Cancun, Puerto Vallarta/Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico City and Los Cabos, he said. Some beach destinations, like Acapulco, have been the scene of some of the drug cartel bloodshed, but still managed to increase its tourism 3% in the first five months of 2011 compared to last year, thanks to national, rather than international, tourism. But some pitfalls of tourism in Mexico persist. Tucson, Arizona, resident Denise Hermosillo and a couple of friends made the six-hour trek last week from her home to Bahia de Kino in the state of Sonora, Mexico. This area is not under a travel warning, but is not among the top destinations for American tourists. \"I was scared out of my mind to go there,\" Hermosillo said. Friends of hers who are in the military are not allowed to cross the border and urged her not to do the same. But she wanted to go to the beach to write for a book she is working on, and Bahia de Kino is the closest one. On the first day of her vacation, her group was pulled over by a police officer, who promptly asked for $100 in exchange to letting them go. In the moment she was frightened, all those stories about bloody ends in Mexico rushing to her mind. But she negotiated the bribe down to $20 and her group was allowed to continue on their journey. \"It was pretty pathetic, I thought. What are you going to do with 20 bucks?\" she said. Still, she was unable to relax during her vacation. Would she go back? She doesn't know. Would she recommend Mexico to a friend? Maybe, but only if you are traveling with someone who could act as a guide."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Despite drug violence, Mexico's tourism increased 2.1% in 2011, led by Americans.

Archaeologists more accustomed to unearthing coins and jewels during digs have discovered a 2,000-year old wooden toilet seat. While the artefact is less glamorous, it is perfectly preserved and incredibly rare because it is thought to be the only seat of its kind used by the Romans to have survived. The toilet seat was discovered at Vindolanda fort on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland and could have been used by soldiers stationed at the border whose job it was to keep the barbarians at bay. Archaeologists used to unearthing treasure such as coins and jewels have discovered a 2,000-year old wooden toilet seat. It is thought to be the only set made of wood that has survived since Roman times . Dr Andrew Birley, director of excavations at the fort, has previously dug up gold and silver or artefacts which relate to the military might of the Roman army, as well as everyday items like letters, shoes and babies' booties. He made the discovery himself in a muddy trench which was previously filled with historic rubbish and thinks the wood survived because mud was packed tightly around it, providing oxygen-free conditions. There are many examples of stone and marble toilet benches from across the Roman Empire but this is believed to be the only surviving wooden seat - perhaps preferred to a cold stone material given the chilly northern location loathed by many Roman soldiers. Dr Andrew Birley discovered the toilet seat in a muddy trench (pictured) which was previously filled with historic rubbish and thinks the wood survived because mud was packed tightly around it . The toilet seat was discovered at Vindolanda fort (pictured) on Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland and was likely used by soldiers stationed at the border whose job it was to keep the barbarians at bay . Vinolanda was a Roman fort south of Hadrian's Wall in northern England. It guarded the Roman road from the River Tyne to Solway Firth. Wooden tablets were discovered there which are considered the most important examples of military and private correspondence found anywhere in the Roman Empire. The garrison was home to auxiliary infantry and cavalry units - not parts of Roman legions. Roman boots, shoes, armours, jewellery, coins and tablets have all been found there. In 2006, a richly-decorated silver brooch featuring the figure of Mars was found. It belonged to Quintus Sollonius, a Gaul, whose name was inscribed on the brooch. It was dumped near the fort which predates Hadrian's Wall, which was constructed from the early second century. \u2018There is always great excitement when you find something that has never been seen before and this discovery is wonderful,\u2019 Dr Birley said. \u2018We know a lot about Roman toilets from previous excavations at the site and from the wider Roman world which have included many fabulous Roman latrines but never before have we had the pleasure of seeing a surviving and perfectly preserved wooden seat. \u2018As soon as we started to uncover it there was no doubt at all on what we had found. It is made from a very well worked piece of wood and looks pretty comfortable. \u2018Now we need to find the toilet that went with it as Roman loos are fascinating places to excavate - their drains often contain astonishing artefacts. \u2018Let's face it, if you drop something down a Roman latrine you are unlikely to attempt to fish it out unless you are pretty brave or foolhardy.\u2019 The toilet seat will go on show at the fort\u2019s museum once it has been preserved.

A social media filter that can identify risky comments or photos and urge people to reconsider what they post could stop sporting stars from being embroiled in online scandals. The real-time monitoring technology has been developed for sporting clubs in a bid to stop players from posting 'inappropriate stuff' on social media that can often tarnish a sport's brand. Former Cronulla Sharks player Todd Carney was the latest NRL player to be disgraced after he was sacked earlier this month when a photo of him urinating in his mouth was published on social media. Former NRL player Todd Carney is the most recent sportsperson to court controversy on social media after an image of him 'bubbling' was published on Twitter earlier this month . Sydney-based company, Kudos Knowledge, developed the filter to pick up risky information on Facebook and Twitter and has the potential to alert a third party like a sport club administrator. The technology will focus on the 'indiscretion' of sport stars but will also be implemented at high schools to try and stamp out online bullying. It will undergo its first trial at Sydney's Matraville Sports High School next month. Moderating tools can recognise risky posts that contain blacklisted words or phrases or if it is posted at a particular time of day, for example 1am to 5am. The Facebook or Twitter post is then automatically stalled while an alert is sent to the person about its offensive nature and asks them to reconsider posting it. Costly: NRL player Josh Dugan's career was almost prematurely ended when after a long string of trouble, he told a Canberra Raiders fan to kill himself on Instagram last year . The post can then be deleted, modified or the warning can be ignored. 'There's an optimistic hope that it will shift behaviours so players think about what they're posting on social media,' Carlton Taya, the director of Kudos Knowledge, told Daily Mail Australia. 'Hopefully this will be a solution that deals with inappropriate stuff being put out there by sporting players.' The Brisbane Broncos famously dropped contract negotiations with NRL player Josh Dugan last year after he told a Canberra Raiders fan on social media to kill himself. West Tigers captain Robbie Farah was also forced to apologise to former Prime Minister Julia Gillard in 2012 after one of his deleted tweets resurfaced, which said Ms Gillard should be given a noose for her 50th birthday. West Tiger player Robbie Farah posted on Twitter in 2012 that then-prime minister Julia Gillard should be given a noose for her 50th birthday . Mr Taya said his company had been in talks with sporting clubs for the past six months about implementing the technology. 'We saw a need for clubs who are concerned about damage to their brand. You think about it, the sporting clubs are very positive about it,' he said. 'There\u2019s no big brother there looking at you, it\u2019s just monitoring and moderating.' Developers are also working on an image function where skin-coloured pixels could flag nudity, or the shapes of weapons could be identified. This could then be used to target Instagram posts and apps like Snapchat. In 2013, George Burgess joined the list of NRL players who have had explicit material of themselves posted on Twitter . The Rabbitohs player had two naked photos posted on social media, but no action was taken against him by his club or the NRL . The technology already has risky key words programmed to help moderate, but sporting clubs or schools would be able to determine exactly what should be filtered. 'Bullying has now become the number one issue in schools. So it\u2019s more about teaching students about what they should or should not be posting,' Mr Taya said. 'If a user is being called a particular name online, that keyword could be loaded into the system and then any post referencing that particular word would be filtered or blocked. 'You can keep loading in more keywords, depending on what the bullies are saying or the victims are experiencing.' The technology, which developers say is teaching a computer to understand the mean behind human actions, took 2.5 years of research and development. Josh Bootsma used social media to inappropriately message a 15-year-old fan and sent explicit Snapchat messages . The list of Australian athletes and sportspeople who have courted controversy on social media is long and diverse. In June AFL player Josh Bootsma sent a string of lurid messages to a young fan just 15 minutes after connecting with her on social media - propositioning her for sex and sending explicit Snapchat messages. As a result, the 21-year-old was later sacked by his club Carlton. English-born South Sydney Rabbitohs NRL player George Burgess was at the centre of a naked selfie scandal, when two photos of him completely naked made it onto Twitter last June, although he escaped unscathed with no action taken against him by his club or the NRL.

The swimmers were on an Olympic team camp in California before the 2012 London Olympics when the photo was taken.

As punishment, both swimmers were sent home from the London Olympics by the Australian Olympic Committee as soon as their swimming events finished and they were also banned from using social media during the games. Swimming's former pinup girl Stephanie Rice also faced intense public backlash after calling the South African rugby team 'f*****s' on Twitter in September 2010. The tweet was made on the back of a rugby union game, which saw the Wallabies beat South Africa's Sprigboks. 'Suck on that f*****s. Probs the best game I've ever seen!! Well done boys,' she posted.

'Shortly before 5am on Sunday, 29 December 2013 the defendant made a telephone call to his father-in-law Gabby Gabriel. 'He said that he had argued and fought with Shamin but there were no serious injuries. 'Mr Gabriel, getting a call like that, perhaps like any father would, caught a taxi to Northolt, arriving at 6.40am. 'He found the defendant in the hallway and noted two things - that all the internal doors were closed and that a mobile phone had been smashed into pieces in the hallway.' Ms Gabriel's father found her in a pool of blood in the kitchen of her home in Northolt, west London . He added: 'The defendant told Mr Gabriel that . Shamin had been talking to another man and was always being praised for . her beauty by other men. 'He said that he had lost consciousness and control, that he was very sorry about what he had done and what had happened to Shamin. 'Otunga opened the kitchen door and Mr Gabriel saw that his daughter was lying on the floor. She had been stabbed many times and the kitchen was covered in blood.'

Tories accused church leaders of playing politics last night for using their Easter messages to attack the Government over poverty and \u2018sinful\u2019 cuts. In his sermon, the Archbishop of Canterbury highlighted the plight of struggling families \u2018left broken and weeping\u2019 by hunger and debt. He told the congregation at Canterbury Cathedral: \u2018In this country, even as the economy improves there is weeping in broken families, in people ashamed to seek help from food banks, or frightened by debt.\u2019 The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said in his sermon: 'Even as the economy improves there is weeping in broken families' And the Bishop of Truro the Right Reverend Tim Thornton spoke of the \u2018sinful consequences\u2019 of the squeeze on local authority budgets. The bishop, who sits on a committee looking at food banks, told Radio 5 Live: \u2018Politicians have to decide how to allocate resources. And in allocating some resources, you are then inevitably taking away from other people. Enfield Southgate MP David Burrowes said last night: 'Of course church leaders can comment on politics, but they should get an appropriate balance' \u2018I am not saying it\u2019s a sin. I am saying that some of these policies lead to effects and consequences which have sinful elements in them.\u2019 The bishops\u2019 comments come amid growing unease over the use of political messages by figures in the Church of England. Last week saw a letter signed by 600 church leaders, including 36 Anglican bishops, calling on the Government to tackle what it called a \u2018national crisis\u2019 of hunger and poverty. The letter cited the rise of food banks as evidence that \u2018unfair and harsh benefits sanctions\u2019 were causing people to go hungry. But the claims contradict findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showing food poverty in Britain has reduced. Many argue there will always be an almost unlimited demand for food that is given away for free and that it does not necessarily mean people are going hungry. Last night Enfield Southgate MP David Burrowes, chairman of the Conservative Christian Fellowship, said: \u2018I don\u2019t remember church leaders in years gone by talking about the huge debt mountain this Government inherited, or talking positively about the number of people now back in work. \u2018Of course church leaders can comment on politics, but they should get an appropriate balance.

Signatories include authors Philip Pullman and Sir Terry Pratchett, broadcasters Dan Snow and Nick Ross, philosopher AC Grayling, and human rights activist Peter Tatchell. Last week the Prime Minister wrote in the Church Times of his own faith and his desire to infuse politics with Christian ideals and values. But the letter says: \u2018Repeated surveys, polls, and studies show most of us as individuals are not Christian in our beliefs or our religious identities...\u00a0 To constantly claim otherwise fosters alienation and division in our society.\u2019 'It cheapens the message of Easter if you engage in party politics.\u2019 Fellow Tory Douglas Carswell, the MP for Clacton, said: \u2018You can\u2019t criticise debt from the pulpit and then have a go at a Government that is trying to do something about it.\u2019 Archbishop Welby left himself open to accusations of hypocrisy after it emerged yesterday that the Church of England still has financial interests in Wonga.

The Prime Minister leans his head to one side as he listens to Foreign Secretary William Hague addressing delegates . Mr Cameron, who was sat next to Mr Hague's wife Ffion, is under pressure to reassure his grassroots activists without appearing to abandon the political centre ground. He is to present himself as the heir to Margaret Thatcher, vowing he is \u2018not for turning\u2019 on the need to tackle Britain\u2019s debt. And the Prime Minister will go further, claiming to have done more to reform schools, pensions and the EU than the Iron Lady. Making clear his determination to . stick his economic plan, Mr Cameron said today: 'I want us to be the . party that actually levels with the British public and talks very . plainly and straightly about what needs to be done. 'The . fact is we have to find those spending reductions, and if we want to . avoid cuts in things like hospitals and school and the services that we . all rely on, we have to look at things like the welfare budget, where . we\u2019re still spending, as a country, \u00a380bn on working-age welfare. Positive: The Prime Minister manages a smile as he sits next to William Hague's wife Ffion on the first day of the Conservative party conference . Crucial week: David Cameron, pictured with William Hague's wife Ffion, is under pressure to reassure Tory activists without appearing to abandon the political centre ground . 'That\u2019s not the pensions, not the disability benefits, but working age welfare,' he told BBC One's Marr Show. But Mr Cameron risks a row with his . Liberal Democrat coalition partners, after publicly ruling out their . idea of a mansion tax as an attack on people who work hard to buy their . own own. The Lib Dems want an levy on all homes worth more than \u00a32million. But Mr Cameron today said: 'I don't . actually believe we should be a country where if you work hard, you . save, you buy yourself a house, you try and pay down the mortgage, you . save and invest into that house - I don't want to be a country that . comes after you every year with a massive great tax. 'So that is not going to happen. But we have put extra taxes where people buy expensive properties. 'We will always be fair and seen to be fair,' he told the BBC. In . a series of interviews today, the PM has admitted he must \u2018raise his . game\u2019 in order to avoid a repeat of the bungling u-turns which have seen . his personal ratings, and those of his party, nosedive. Samantha and David Cameron arrived at the ICC Birmingham today for the start of the Conservative conference where the Prime Minister unveiled a raft of policies aimed at boosting his opinion poll ratings . David Cameron told BBC One's Marr Show that he would would rule out the Liberal Democrat's mansion tax . An . Opinium/Observer poll today put Labour on 41 per cent, up to points, . with Tories on 30 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on nine. But . Mr Cameron will us the conference to insist he will not be diverted . from his austerity plans, demanding billions of pounds of public . spending cuts, in an echo of Mrs Thatcher\u2019s famous \u2018the lady\u2019s not for . turning\u2019 promise at the Tory conference in 1980. David Cameron and his ministers will use the Tory conference to unveil a raft of policies in an attempt to boost the party's opinion poll ratings. They include: . Ministers are buoyed by improving economic figures, but are anxious about being seen to publicly predict 'green shoots' of recovery. George Osborne, the chancellor, said he thought the economy was 'healing'. Today, Mr Cameron said he could not predict the next set of economic figures, but was confident that the economy was being rebalanced. But others are more publicly optimistic. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond claimed that the public would see real economic improvement by 2014, provided the Euro remained stable. 'You won't find anybody, hardly anybody in the business community or in the financial community, who thinks that the economy is doing right now what the data tell us it is doing,' Mr Hammond told The Observer. Both the Conservatives and Liberal . Democrats have made clear that their election prospects in 2015 will . depend on the state of the economy. He admits he must do more to \u2018explain\u2019 what the government is doing. \u2018You spend a lot of time governing and deciding, and you don\u2019t spend enough time explaining. \u2018And I think conference week is a real opportunity to get out there and explain.\u2019 But he makes clear there will be no deviation from the need for tough decisions on the economy. Mr Cameron said: \u2018I think the British public are extremely fair minded. \u2018I . think they know that Britain faces difficult circumstances, they know . the hole that we\u2019re in is quite a deep one, they know it takes time to . get out,\u2019 he told the Sunday Telegraph. \u2018Of course, there are things that . we\u2019ve done that they don\u2019t like, of course there are things they wish we . had done differently. That\u2019s in the nature of things But, the public . know this is difficult and tough, and it\u2019s a five year parliament, and . my sense is that they\u2019ll judge us at the end of it rather than half way . through it. \u2018We\u2019ve got a lot to prove and there\u2019s no doubt that the mountain in front of us has got steeper and more difficult to climb.\u2019 David Cameron used interviews today to insist he will not be diverted from his 'austerity' economic plan but promised help for homeowners and commuters . The sun shone on the first day of the Tory conference, as senior ministers struck a more upbeat tone on the state of the economy . The conference theme \u2018Britain can deliver\u2019 will focus on the economy and try to present a more upbeat vision of the future. As . delegates gather in Birmingham, the PM brushed aside claims he had . failed to take tough decisions and boasted that he had been bolder than . Mrs Thatcher. 'So have we dithered over educational reform? Mrs Thatcher never reformed public sector pensions. We have done that. \u2018Mrs Thatcher never vetoed a European treaty. I have done that. \u2018Capping welfare payments \u2014 no government has ever done that,\u2019 he told The Sun. 'If we just wanted to be popular, we would not have targeted the deficit.' Strategists . hope that taking a tough line with Brussels will recreate the opinion . poll boost enjoyed by the Conservatives after Mr Cameron vetoed a new . treaty in December last year. The . PM today said he would block 'outrageous' attempts to increase the . overall EU budget in looming talks on spending for 2014 to 2020. 'If it comes to saying 'no' to a deal that isn't right for Britain, I'll say 'no',' he told The Sunday Telegraph. David Cameron claimed today that he had been bolder than Margaret Thatcher as he promised to block 'outrageous' EU demands for an even bigger budget . And he set out a 'bold thinking' idea which would split the EU budgets into one for the 17 eurozone nations and another for the 10 - including Britain - outside the single currency. In one of the most eye-catching announcements, Mr Cameron said the government would cap rises in rail fares. Train companies were going to be . allowed to raise the average price of regulated fares - which include . season tickets - by RPI inflation plus three per cent in January 2013 . and then again in January 2014. But . Mr Cameron said that the rise for the next two years will be limited to . RPI plus one per cent, or 4.2 per cent instead of the planned 6.2 per . cent. Some commuters will be over \u00a3200 better off over the two years. The PM insisted it was proof that he was not abandoning the political centre ground. 'Are the Conservatives deserting the common ground of British politics? Absolutely not. David Cameron announced that from January, season tickets will rise by 4.2 per cent, and not the planned 6.2 per cent . 'I think the common ground of British politics, right now, ought to be [doing] everything you can to fire up the engines of enterprise and aspiration to get the economy moving, while holding onto the things that people care about passionately, like the NHS. I think that is absolutely where we are.' But Mr Cameron ruled out cuts to benefits for wealthy pensioners. 'Let me be absolutely clear, . the promise that I made at the last election to Britain's pensioners . when I said we are not going to take away your winter fuel allowance, . your free TV licences, your free bus passes - that promise stands.' The Prime Minister also defended the decision to reduce the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p - seized on by Labour as a 'tax cut for millionaires'. 'The richest 10 per cent in our country are not only paying more in income tax, they are paying a greater percentage of the total income tax take than they ever did under Labour,' Mr Cameron said. But Labour's Michael Dugher renewed the attack on the Tories. 'David Cameron can't be a One Nation Prime Minister. He says one thing, but time and again does another,' Mr Dugher said. 'He says those at the top will need to pay more, but he is the man whose top priority is to cut taxes for millionaires, giving 8,000 people earning over \u00a31 million a tax break of \u00a340,000 this April.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Cameron, tired at the conference, pledged to tackle debt, reform sectors, cap rail fare rises, and maintain pensioner benefits.

Property developer Jonathan Liebmann is busy rejuvenating the South African city's industrial heart after years of urban decay, with his Maboneng Precinct, on the east side of Johannesburg's central business district. Maboneng -- meaning \"place of light\" in Sotho -- is now a mixed-zone neighborhood, full of shops, restaurants and residences, which comes alive at the weekend. And it could follow in the footsteps of London's trendy East End and the shabby-chic streets of Williamsburg in New York as Johannesburg's young middle class flood to the district. Read more: Africa's tech cities and mega dams . Liebmann said: \"The area has really transformed from being a rundown industrial area into being a new living and workspace for people looking for something alternative.\" Liebmann and his team own 35 properties in the area and have developed 10 of those buildings since 2008. \"It's paid off financially, but it will pay off more in the medium to long term,\" he added. The Maboneng Precinct's first project, called \"Arts on Main\" is a creative hub boasting an in-house restaurant, rooftop bar and an exhibition space as well as a studio for some of South Africa's most respected artists. Read more: Fast-food giants target Africa . Prices for an apartment in Maboneng range anywhere from 280,000 rand ($28,500) to 3 million rand ($305,000), and Liebmann said that since he started buying up properties in Johannesburg, prices have sky-rocketed. \"Initially buildings were being bought for 100 euros a square meter,\" he said. \"I think prices have tripled, but that still makes it very competitive when you compare it to the suburbs. There are still very good deals to be enjoyed.\" But for seemingly low prices by Western standards, Maboneng still remains an aspirational area for many of the city's 3.8 million inhabitants. Despite South Africa being the continent's largest economy, 23% of the population is below the poverty line. Liebmann said that Maboneng's continued development will have a positive impact on Johannesburg, known as the \"City of Gold,\" as other similar projects spring up around the city. \"There's always a knock-on effect,\" he said, \"it's all coming together now in total regeneration.\" Another company investing in Johannesburg real estate is Kempston Group. Originally a trucking company, today Kempston Group owns 100 commercial, industrial and farming properties around South Africa. Read more: Liberia: From warzone to holiday paradise? And the firm is now taking on a mammoth project to transform the notorious Ponte City skyscraper in the heart of Johannesburg. When it was built in the 1970s, Ponte City was a desirable place to live. But having loomed over the city for nearly four decades, it became a symbol of the urban decay as the abandoned building fell victim to crime, drugs and prostitution toward the end of the last century. When it was taken over in 2001, after years of neglect, five stories of discarded trash had to be removed as the building's rejuvenation took place. Kempston Group founder Tony Cotterell, who is overseeing the renovation, explained: \"We bought in large conveyer belts with earth-moving equipment and we started moving it out.\" The group has invested tens of millions of dollars into the project and has already finished renovating the residential floors. Cotterell says all of the 500 apartments currently in Ponte are occupied. \"What we're creating is an environment where people can feel safe,\" said Cotterell. \"It's a big change from where it was 15 years ago.

The increase, up from \u00a34.1million in 2012, means it now takes the head of a top company just two days to earn \u00a326,500 - the total amount the average British worker is paid in an entire year. The news comes as millions of Britons face hardship following years of pay freezes and pitiful rises below the rate of inflation, and further highlights the growing divide between the super-wealthy and those struggling to make ends meet. Sir Martin Sorrell of advertising giant WPP was the highest earning FTSE 100 executive last year, raking in \u00a329.8million in just 12 months, according to a study by investor research company Manifest. His taxable remuneration package, which includes base pay, pensions and long-term bonuses cashed in 2013, was almost three times higher than any other company boss. In second place was Donald Robert of financial investment firm Experian with \u00a310.1million, while Tidjane Thiam of life insurance and financial services multinational Prudential earned \u00a38.6million. In fact Sorrell's record-breaking pay was so high that nearly 30 per cent of WPP shareholders refused to back the package at a meeting last year.

When the figures are adjusted to strip out stock market performance related pay and leave only remuneration packages agreed in advance, the numbers are quite different. This data measure - known as Total Remuneration Awarded - suggests the average pay for a FTSE 100 executive actually fell by seven per cent last year, following a fall of five per cent in 2012. Despite this the research will make uncomfortable reading for campaigners who have long argued that executive pay is excessive.

For many years Ricky Naputi, who at his heaviest tipped the scales at more than 400 kilograms (900 pounds), battled with his food addiction, and at the time of his death hadn't walked on his own for more than 7 years. His wife Cheryl described looking after him as 'just like taking care of an overgrown baby', and Ricky fell in and out of a deep depression over the state his life was in. The couple live on the island of Guam, just a four hour flight from Brisbane - where 6 out of 10 people are classified as either overweight or obese. Scroll down for video . The world's fattest man, Ricky Naputi, was cared for by his wife Cheryl for many years . Cheryl was Ricky's primary caretaker, and said when they married she knew what she was in for and that she very well may outlive him, if he didn't get his health in check. 'When Ricky and I met he was already a big man. So when he asked me to marry him I knew what I was getting myself into', Cheryl said during a TLC documentary - which tracked the couple's life over Ricky's final years. From there the couple embarked on a difficult and challenging journey to try and get Ricky to lose weight - each doctor giving him the same ultimatum - lose weight, or your life. The man was confined to his bed, and Cheryl did everything for him from cooking his food to cleaning every inch of his huge body, and helping him go to the toilet. Ricky was so huge he was unable to do anything on his own, and became short of breath ever just from speaking . At his heaviest the man weighed in at over 400 kilograms, or 900 pounds . Ricky could barely speak without becoming short of breath, let alone stand up or move from the bed he was confined to. He often needed the assistance of an oxygen machine. But Cheryl and Ricky had dreams to start a family and have children, despite never having consummated their marriage due to Ricky's extreme obesity. In desperation, he reached out to a woman from Houston, Texas, named Angie Flores who lost more than 80 kilograms after undergoing gastric surgery and is now an advocate for others looking to change their lives in the same way. Ricky desperately needed surgery which reduces the size of the stomach by 80 percent, but could not undergo it until he lost at least 40 kilograms on his own first. He battled with severe depression and was confined to his bed for the last years of his life . He desperately needed gastric surgery to remove 80 percent of his stomach but had to lose weight before that could take place . From there the morbidly obese man's life over the next few years took a cyclical and repetitive nature which eventually lead to the breakdown of his marriage, and later, his death. First Dr Duc Vuong, originally a refugee from Vietnam who trained in America as a obesity specialist, took the trip to Guam with Angie to assess the state of Ricky and the possibility of Ricky undergoing surgery. Dr Vuong told Ricky he must shift some weight on his own before he can even consider any procedure, and also laid some of the responsibility on Cheryl as she is the one who cooks for him. She admitted she was not strong enough to resist his begging for food - and lots of it - and said despite being immobile her husband was in control. His wife Cheryl cooked for him and struggled to say no to her husband when he insisted on more food . During one visit he was so heavy he could not even stand on the scales on his own and needed to lean on furniture . 'When it comes to food and Ricky wants something he'll keep going on and on and on and on until I finally give it to him. It's very hard because I am his wife - can I control his eating habits, no I can't.' When Dr Vuong reached out to a clinic on the Island, the head of the facility Dr John Steel gave Ricky the same ultimatum. If he couldn't lose any weight on his own then he could not be helped, it was simply too dangerous to try and perform surgery. The possibility of moving Ricky to Houston for an operation slowly became more and more impossible as he failed to lose weight, and the next step was to reach out to a doctor in Australia. World leading obesity surgeon George Hopkins, from Brisbane Australia, also made the trip to Guam to discuss the possibility of performing the surgery closer to home for Ricky - but again gave the man the same conditions. During the programme, he said: 'It's hard being stuck here, I can't go nowhere I'm so depressed' In the end, Cheryl and Ricky's marriage broke down. Ricky took some pills and stopped breathing. He died aged 39 . When he delivered it Ricky and Cheryl broke down, and said they couldn't handle hearing that Ricky had to lose weight on his own any more as they believed they had done all they could. 'It's hard being stuck here, I can't go nowhere I'm so depressed. I'm stuck in this bed every single day. Every single day', Ricky said through tears earlier in the documentary. In the end, Cheryl and Ricky's marriage broke down and Ricky took 'some pills' and stopped breathing. An hour and a half of CPR by paramedics failed to revive him and he died aged 39. Ricky's story highlights the obesity epidemic sweeping the world - and shows although he was presented with many ways out he could not overcome his demons. He described his relationship with food as 'like a bad drug addicts battle with', and his official cause of death was determined to be morbid obesity following his death on November 10, 2012."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ricky Naputi, the world's heaviest man at over 400 kilograms, was bedridden for years.

Kepler-186f is special because it marks the first planet almost exactly the same size as Earth orbiting in the \u2018habitable zone\u2019 \u2013 the distance from a star in which we might expect liquid water, and perhaps life. What did not make the news, however, is that this discovery also slightly increases how much credence we give to the possibility of imminent human extinction. Last week, astronomers said they had discovered a planet called Kepler-186f, artist's impression pictured. Kepler-186f is special because it marks the first planet almost exactly the same size as Earth orbiting in the 'habitable zone' This because of a concept known as the Great Filter. The Great Filter is an argument that attempts to resolve the Fermi Paradox: why have we not found aliens, despite the existence of hundreds of billions of solar systems in our galactic neighbourhood in which life might evolve? As the namesake physicist Enrico Fermi noted, it seems rather extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has been detected - UFO conspiracy theorists notwithstanding. This apparent absence of thriving extraterrestrial civilisations suggests that at least one of the steps from humble planet to interstellar civilisation is exceedingly unlikely. This image of Kepler-186f based on what the astronomers expect it might look like. Plant life is yellow due to the manner in which it reflects light from the star but the water and clouds would probably be more orange . The Great Filter is an argument that attempts to resolve the Fermi Paradox. This paradox questions why have we not found aliens, despite the existence of hundreds of billions of exosolar systems in our galactic neighborhood in which life might evolve. Physicist Enrico Fermi believed it to extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has yet been detected. He claims there must be some kind of barrier that prevents the rise of intelligent, self-aware, technologically advanced, space-colonising civilisations. We can think of\u00a0 this barrier as a \u2018Great Filter\u2019. The absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct. The absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct. This bottleneck for the emergence of alien civilisations from any one of the many billions of planets is referred to as the Great Filter. What exactly is causing this bottleneck has been the subject of debate for more than 50 years. Explanations could include a paucity of Earth-like planets or self-replicating molecules. Other possibilities could be an improbable jump from simple prokaryotic life - cells without specialised parts - to more complex eukaryotic life. After all, this transition took well over a billion years on Earth. Proponents of this \u2018Rare Earth\u2019 hypothesis also argue that the evolution of complex life requires an exceedingly large number of perfect conditions. In addition to Earth being in the habitable zone of the sun, our star must be far enough away from the galactic centre to avoid destructive radiation, our gas giants must be massive enough to sweep asteroids from Earth\u2019s trajectory, and our unusually large moon stabilises the axial tilt that gives us different seasons. These are just a few prerequisites for complex life. The emergence of symbolic language, tools and intelligence could require other such \u2018perfect conditions\u2019 as well. Physicist Enrico Fermi noted that it seems extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has been detected - UFO conspiracy theorists notwithstanding . According to the Great Filter theory, discovering life on another planet in a solar system would suggest that the emergence of life is not that rare. If it happened independently twice in a solar system, it must have happened millions times across the galaxy. This would mean that the Great Filter is less likely to occur in the early life of planets and is therefore more likely still to come. If the Great Filter is still to arrive, it would mean that there is some great event - such as its possible demise - that would prevent humanity from travelling to other parts of the galaxy. While emergence of intelligent life could be rare, the silence could also be the result of intelligent life emerging frequently but subsequently failing to survive for long. Might every sufficiently advanced civilisation stumble across a suicidal technology or unsustainable trajectory? We know that a Great Filter prevents the emergence of prosperous interstellar civilisations, but we don\u2019t know whether or not it lies in humanity\u2019s past or awaits us in the future. For 200,000 years humanity has survived supervolcanoes, asteroid impacts, and naturally occurring pandemics. But our track record of survival is limited to just a few decades in the presence of nuclear weaponry. And we have no track record at all of surviving many of the radically novel technologies that are likely to arrive this century. Esteemed scientists such as Astronomer Royal Martin Rees at the Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk point to advances in biotechnology as being potentially catastrophic. While emergence of intelligent life could be rare, the silence could also be the result of intelligent life emerging frequently but subsequently failing to survive for long . Others such as Stephen Hawking, Max Tegmark and Stuart Russell, also with the Cambridge Centre, have expressed serious concern about the exotic but understudied possibility of machine superintelligence. Let\u2019s hope Kepler-186f is barren. When the Fermi Paradox was initially proposed, it was thought that planets themselves were rare. Since then, however, the tools of astronomy have revealed the existence of hundreds of exoplanets. That just seems to be the tip of the iceberg. But each new discovery of an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone, such as Kepler-186f, makes it less plausible that there are simply no planets aside from Earth that might support life. Kepler is a space observatory launched by Nasa to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. Data from Kepler could help humans find alien life . The Great Filter is thus more likely to be lurking in the path between habitable planet and flourishing civilisation. If Kepler-186f is teeming with intelligent life, then that would be really bad news for humanity. For that fact would push back the Great Filter\u2019s position further into the technological stages of a civilisation\u2019s development. We might then expect that catastrophe awaits both our extraterrestrial companions and ourselves. In the case of Kepler-186f, we still have many reasons to think intelligent life might not emerge. The atmosphere might be too thin to prevent freezing, or the planet might be tidally locked, causing a relatively static environment. Discovery of these hostile conditions should be cause for celebration. As philosopher Nick Bostrom once said: \u2018The silence of the night sky is golden \u2026 in the search for extraterrestrial life, no news is good news. It promises a potentially great future for humanity.\u2019 Andrew Snyder-Beattie works at the University of Oxford.

Details of the alleged horrific incident emerged in court this week during 74-year-old Clyde Berg's preliminary hearing on charges of corporal injury of a spouse and sexual penetration by force. His Swedish wife Ellena Berg, 37, was found bloodied and bound in the couple's San Jose home last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly husband outfitted her with the leash and chained her to the bed while sexually assaulting her with the golf club. Berg is not the father of her child. Wife: Ellena Berg, 37, was found bloodied and bound in her San Jose home last year when she was nine-months pregnant and told police her elderly husband chained her to the bed . She took the stand yesterday at Santa Clara County Hall of Justice to present her version of events to a judge who must now decide if there is enough evidence to hold Berg over for trial. The real estate magnate - who is worth $200 million - vehemently denies the charges and claims he's the victim of a scam to get around a restrictive prenuptial agreement. He faces 15 years to life in prison. During her testimony yesterday, Ellena shocked the court by refusing to answer to key questions - one about a night in 2010 when she was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and how her two previous pregnancies ended. The San Jose Mercury News reported that when the 37-year-old said, 'I refuse to answer that', in response to one of the questions, the judge's eyes widened. The Swedish native has claimed in a 43-page civil suit that the incident capped off ten years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of her husband. The divorce papers state that Clyde Berg wielded his considerable power against her like 'a weapon of mass destruction' and claim she lived in virtual isolation 'as a slave' in fear of his unpredictable physical and sexual abuse.

Police are 37 times more likely to stop and search a black person than a white person, latest research has shown. Human rights group, The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), investigated what are known as section 60 stops, where officers detain people without suspecting them of being involved in any particular crime. The researchers discovered that while overall use of the power had fallen, excessive use against ethnic minorities had continued or in some instances increased. Racial profiling: Black people are 37 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people (file picture) Three quarters of all Section 60 stops were carried out by the Metropolitan police, a total of 258,000 between 2008 and 2011. The next highest was Merseyside Police where officers conducted 40,940 Section 60s in the same time period. Some forces barely used the power at all. (File picture) Between 2008 and 2009 Metropolitan Police officers stopped 68 of every 1,000 black people in their area . According to the EHRC, between 2008 and 2009, Met officers stopped 68 of every 1,000 black people in their area. Although this fell by more than half between 2010 and 2011 to 32.8 per 1,000, in the rest of England the figure was just 1.2 per 1,000. However the highest rates of racial disproportionality were outside London with an officer in the West Midlands 28 times more likely to search a black person than a white person. Overall black people were found to be 37 times more likely to be stopped under Section 60 that white people. Asian people were 10 times more likely to be stopped. The effectiveness of the searches has also been called in to question as it was revealed that between 2008 and 2009 only 2.8 per cent of Section 60 searches resulted in an arrest falling to just 2.4 per cent between 2010 and 2011. In most cases police officers are required to have what is referred to as 'reasonable suspicion' that someone is involved in a crime before conducting a search. However the Section 60 power, which is part of the 1994 Public Order Act introduced as a response to the rise in illegal raves, gives an officer the power to stop and search a person simply because they might fear violence or disorder. Response: A spokesman for the Met defended its use of Section 60 searches saying: 'These powers are critical in our efforts to tackle knife, gun and gang crimes' A spokesman for EHRC told the Guardian newspaper: 'Black youths are still being disproportionally targetted and without a clear explanation as to why, many in the community will see this as racial profiling. 'Moreover, police data itself questions the effectiveness of this practise. Some forces are using 200 or 300 stops before arresting an individual over a weapon.' A spokesman for the Met defended its use of Section 60 searches saying: 'These powers are critical in our efforts to tackle knife, gun and gang crimes.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "EHRC research indicates that under Section 60 of the 1994 Public Order Act, black and Asian individuals are disproportionately stopped by police.

Rielle Hunter says the first time she slept with John Edwards was the 'most extraordinary night of her life.' Lurid details continue to emerge about the affair that annihilated the two-time presidential candidate's political career as Hunter's tell-all memoir slowly leaks to the public. The couple met in February 2006 at the Regency Hotel in New York City. Hours after Hunter approached the former North Carolina Senator, he called her up to his hotel room for a night of 'surrender' and 'zero sleep.' Scroll down for video . Together: John Edwards in pictured in New Orleans in this December 2006 photo with Rielle Hunter, who worked as a videographer for the campaign . First night: Hunter slept with Edwards within hours of meeting him at an event at the Regency Hotel in New York City in February 2006 . Hunter claims she wrote the book, 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me,' to publicly explanation the six-year romance to the couple's love child, Frances Quinn Hunter. However, the former campaign videographer seems to leave little to the imagination about her sex life. The book is due out June 26. An extensive interview with ABC News will air Friday on '20/20.' Hunter says she caught Edwards' eye at the hotel when she followed him out of a reception and said, 'You are so hot.' Hours later, she got a call from him inviting her to his room. She claims she went only because she thought she could give Edwards advice for his presidential campaign. But that all changed the moment she was alone behind closed doors with 'her Johnny.' 'The connection I felt when I walked in the door had only grown and the amount of energy between us was huge and unstoppable,' Hunter writes, according to an excerpt obtained by Radar Online. Speaking up: Rielle Hunter, with her daughter Quinn, speaks to Chris Cuomo for 20/20 . Shot at redemption: After his acquittal on campaign finance violations last month, John Edwards pledged to rebuild his public image . 'And then a moment came while we were talking when something in my heart clicked and I surrendered. I took off my teacher hat, let go of all my resistance to him and let him lead. And lead he did. He led me toward the most extraordinary night of my life. There was a lot of talk, a lot of laughter and zero sleep.' But Hunter says she didn't give in easily to sleeping with a married man -- it took Edwards telling her a story about having three other mistresses to get her into bed that first night they met. 'He told me that he had an entire hidden life that had gone on for decades and that he was currently involved with three different women. One lived in Los Angeles, one in Florida, and one in Chicago,' Hunter writes, according to Radar Online. 'Clearly, this behavior of his was not going to change overnight... I also told him that if I was going to help him, he couldn't lie to me. He needed to have one person in his life that was safe for him. He said that wasn't a problem, and when he said that, I felt a wave of total relief roll off of him. He needed this safe place. Somewhere in the midst of our talk, long after I realized how far off the rails his marriage was, and for how long it had been that way, something happened between us.' In the public eye: Hunter's affair with John Edwards which resulted in their daughter Quinn, cost the former senator his bid for the White House . Under siege: Elizabeth Edwards, pictured here three months before she died of cancer, is called abusive and 'venomous' by Hunter . But Edwards did lie to Hunter. He lied that night about the three other mistresses -- and used the lie to manipulate her for five years. He didn't come clean about his love life until 2011, she says. Edwards had two other mistresses, he said, but both those affairs ended before his 2004 bid to become Vice President. Hunter, 48, says she spent most of her 20s snorting cocaine as she pursued an acting career in New York. But she got past drug abuse before she turned 30 and replaced it, she claims, with a quest for 'spiritual growth.' The book contains a full-throated defense of her lover -- even as she is coy about the status of their relationship. Hunter . attacks Edwards' wife Elizabeth, who died in December 2010 of breast cancer, . calling her 'crazy,' 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels.' She says her abusive behavior toward John Edwards drove him into the arms of other women. Other accounts of the 2008 . presidential campaign, including 'Game Change' by journalists John . Heilemann and Mark Halperin back up Hunter's portrait of Elizabeth . Edwards as controlling and potentially abusive. He also blasts Andrew Young, John Edwards top aide, who helped hide the affair for several years. She . says it was Young's idea for Edwards and Hunter and lie and say . Hunter's baby, Quinn, belonged to him and not the presidential . candidate. Hunter . repeated the lie in an interview with the National Enquirer and . Edwards, famously, told ABC News during an August 2008 broadcast that . the baby was not his. He didn't publicly acknowledge his love child until 2010, when she was nearly two. Hunter's book is a window into the life of a political mistress. Tell-all: In an interview with ABC News, scheduled to air on Friday, Rielle Hunter describes her life as a political mistress . Major . New York publishers had said they were not interested in Hunter's book, . citing her negative image, so it is instead being released through a . Dallas-based boutique publisher, BenBella Books. She describes waiting for hours at hotel bars for her lover to swoop in off the campaign trail. They . often shared hurried dinners over take-out before short, passionate . romps. Then, Edwards had to leave and return to his cancer-stricken wife . and his life in the public eye. When Edwards faced the prospect of an . indictment that could put him behind bars, he calmly told Hunter he . would probably wind up in a low-security prison in Virginia more like a . country club than a jail. Disgraced: Former senator John Edwards was acquitted on one count of accepting illegal campaign funds and a mistrial was declared on the five other counts . She quickly responded that she and their daughter would move there to be near him if that happened. Federal prosecutors spent a year prosecuting Edwards, culminating in a six-week trial that ended last month. Jurors acquitted Edwards on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions and deadlocked on five other felony counts. The . judge declared a mistrial. Federal prosecutors then said in a court . order earlier this month that they wouldn't retry Edwards, and the . charges against him were dropped. Neither Edwards nor Hunter testified.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Thursday it expects to grant a permit to the Shiloh IV Wind Project, a 3,500-acre wind farm near Rio Vista, California, within 30 days that would allow for the deaths of five golden or bald eagles over a five-year period without the wind farm's operators being penalized. \"The permit, the first of its kind, requires the company to engage in conservation measures that protect the local population of golden eagles, while providing greater regulatory certainty for the company,\" the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said  in a statement. Shiloh, which is a subsidiary of EDF Renewable Energy, also produced what the federal service described as a conservation plan to help minimize the wind farm's impact, not only on eagles, but on bats and other migratory birds, as well. \"The Shiloh IV eagle permit sets a precedent for proactive and collaborative eagle conservation at wind farms in northern California,\" according to a statement from service director Dan Ashe.

He says the conditions of the permit are still unclear because the permit has not been issued yet. \"We don't like it when any bird is killed. We certainly don't like it when any eagle is killed,\" George told CNN Thursday. But the group has supported the permits as a way to work with the industry to help it minimize the number of bird deaths on wind farms. \"We think the permit process is one way to do that.\" He added \"we hope it provides conservation, but we don't know if it will.\" It's unclear exactly how many eagles, in addition to other birds, are killed by the powerful turbines on wind farms every year. Only a small percentage of farms actually count the birds that are killed by the power turbine blades. \"Farms aren't required to count the number of birds killed.... I've seen various numbers. I don't think we really know, but it's a lot,\" George said. Bald eagles, in particular, are protected under federal laws, even though they are no longer on the endangered species list. A wind farm could incur steep penalties in the event of eagle deaths. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the permits help protect wind farms from accidental eagle deaths.

There are more of you out there than you might think. Clark Howard: Before jumping at all the new car deals, think about the bigger picture of car ownership costs. CNW Marketing Research, a respected automotive marketing research firm, reports that 4 million used cars were purchased in the United States during the month of May alone. That's amazing when you consider that the market for new cars is 9 million in the United States over the course of an entire 12 months. Yet don't overlook the new car as a potential purchase just yet. New data from Comerica Bank's Auto Affordability Index shows that new cars are now the most affordable they've been since records started being kept in 1979. In fact, the average new car is now $1,700 cheaper than it was during the last quarter of 2008. And we've got more price cuts coming because of oversupply. As you probably know, I'm a used car guy, the self-proclaimed champion of driving a car until the wheels fall off. So I can't believe the advice that I am about to give ... but it's now possible to get a better deal on a brand new car than on a relatively new used car. Watch Clark Howard talk to a woman who learned what not to do when buying a used car \u00bb . It's really just a classic case of supply and demand. The used car market is up about 23 percent, and new car sales are down 34 percent, according to CNW. More new cars on dealer lots mean more deals for you. But realize this: It's just a temporary phenomenon. Do not take this blip on the radar as gospel for the future; in most instances, a used car will almost always be a better buy. Just not right now. When buying a new vehicle, you want to start by arranging your financing first. Go to your bank or credit union and prequalify for a car loan or apply online. This will tell you how much car you can afford and what type of monthly payment you will have to budget. Next, you want to get a price for the car you have in mind. In the past, I've talked about using CarsDirect.com to get a guaranteed quote. A car dealer then can do his or her best to beat that online quote and win your business. In some cases, the price from CarsDirect.com winds up being the best a consumer can get. But now there's a new kid on the block known as Zag.com. This service gives buyers instant guaranteed upfront prices from a network of certified dealers. It also offers an easy delivery process that helps you avoid \"the grind\" at a dealership. Do you know what \"the grind\" is? That's when you're at a dealer lot, and the sales representative says he or she will go talk to the manager about getting you the best deal. Instead they go watch TV for five minutes, and then come back and tell you that the manager couldn't help out with a good price -- despite their best efforts on your behalf. That's why sites such as Zag and CarsDirect are so appealing; they take you out of the car dealers' ballpark and put you on level playing ground. But before you jump at all the new car deals, take a moment to think about the bigger picture of car ownership costs. It's more than just the sticker price and the expense of gas. AAA reports that the true annual cost of owning and operating a car is $9,369. Ouch. That $9,369 takes into account somewhat hidden costs such as insurance, maintenance, interest on a car note, depreciation and other factors.

So it was no surprise that, when faced with rising energy costs, Saylor turned to technology. He tapped into an abundant and easily accessible energy source: manure from about 600 cows.  Watch how cow poo powers the farm \u00bb . \"It's a pretty simple process. There's not really a lot to it,\" Saylor said. \"Manure comes from the cows, and there's energy left in the manure.\" The process is known as anaerobic digestion, and here's how it works: . With the help of a mechanical scraper in the barn, manure drops into a 19,000-gallon tank. The slurry then moves into the digester, which is 16 feet deep and 70 feet in diameter. It's heated there for about 16 days while the bacteria break down the organic matter in order to produce methane gas. That gas is burned in two engine generators to make electricity.  See an interactive explaining the process \u00bb . Heat created by the generators keeps the digester hot, heats the buildings around the farm and helps provide hot water. The electricity is used to power this farm and a dozen neighboring homes, Saylor said. And there's still some left over, which he sells back to the grid. Overall, the poo power helps Saylor's bottom line. \"In savings, there's $200,000 a year, in either extra income from sale of electricity or cost offsets,\" he said. \"So you're talking about system project costs of over a million dollars to build the system but a payback of five years or less.\" Before he installed the system, the pungent smell from the cows could linger for three to four days, Saylor said. \"The farm used to get a lot of complaints from motorists, which is understandable. It used to stink a lot.\" Now, the digesters reduce 98 percent of all odor, although he admits that if the wind blows, you still \"get a whiff.\" The farm's leftover solid waste is sold to the community. \"We use it for bedding for the animals,\" according to Saylor. \"A lot of people like to get it for their gardens ... because it doesn't smell much.\" Farm-based digesters became popular in the United States during the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s. But the technology didn't catch on, possibly because of the high operational costs and declining energy prices, according to the Department of Agriculture. Although Saylor had been interested in digesters for years, his dream didn't become reality until 2006. That's when he received a $600,000 grant from Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection. But Saylor's work isn't done. He intends to make his farm entirely self-sufficient by using waste vegetable oil to make biodiesel fuel. He said his goal is to waste nothing. \"In a biodiesel system, all the waste products can either be used or fed back into the digester to make more gas,\" he said. \"I've always looked at new technologies and believed you kind of have to work with that stuff to stay with the future.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Shawn Saylor's Pennsylvania dairy farm uses anaerobic digestion to convert cow manure into electricity and solid waste, reducing odor by 98%.

Geared up: NHS paramedics are being issued with bullet-proof jackets like this one in case they have to respond with a Mumbai-style attack in Britain . Paramedics will be issued with bullet-proof jackets and trained to respond to a Mumbai-style terror attack, it emerged today. NHS volunteers are being trained to deal with the aftermath of a 'marauding terrorist gun attack' like the one which left 164 dead in the Indian city in 2008. Most will be trained to treat battlefield casualties over the next four years. However, body armour and initial guidance has already been given to small teams of ambulance and fire crews in key areas. The policy was mooted in a Home Office paper in the summer and confirmed for the first time by the Department of Health this weekend. 'The government has to prepare for the worst and we also need to be certain that lessons are learnt from previous terrorist attacks at home and abroad,' the department told The Sunday Times. 'Where specialist ambulance crews may be asked to respond to incidents involving firearms, it is necessary that they receive proper training and are provided with appropriate personal protective equipment.' The move, which according to one military source was designed to replicate protection given to the army, was applauded by former terrorism czar Lord Carlile as a 'very sensible precaution'. Worst-case scenario: A victim of a gun attack lies on a hospital bed at the St George's hospital in Mumbai, India, in November 2008. Indian medics had to treat the dying and injured in perilous conditions . Disaster zone: A policeman stands guard after shootings at a railway station in Mumbai. The response to the atrocities was far more like going into battle . It harks back to the days of the Troubles in Northern Ireland when bullet-proof jackets were used by ambulance staff at the height of the conflict. However, this is the first time the equipment has been given to medics on the mainland. The atrocities, which had been planned for a long time in advance, involved 10 co-ordinated bombing and shooting assaults by Islamists on hotels and restaurants in the country's largest city. Scotland Yard has been warning hotels, restaurants and financial companies about the possibility of copycat attacks in Britain. On the front line: Paramedics are afforded a reasonable amount of protection when dealing with dangerous incidents, but the government believes this should go a step further amid terror threats to Britain ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NHS paramedics and key ambulance, fire crews are being equipped with bullet-proof jackets and trained for Mumbai-style terror attacks, as per a Home Office paper.

Crusading: The Guantanamo comparison was made by lawyer Phil Shiner, pictured, a long-time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan . Listeners to BBC radio were assured that it was a scandal to compare with Guantanamo Bay and the American detention of terror suspects without time limit and without trial. Breathlessly, reporters revealed that they had been given documents showing 85 Afghans were in a British holding camp near Kabul. This might amount to unlawful detention and internment, they said. A little later a familiar name appeared in the BBC reports. The Guantanamo comparison was made by crusading lawyer Phil Shiner, a long-time scourge of alleged wrongdoing by the armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Indeed, it was Mr Shiner who led the case that ended with a 2010 High Court block on the transfer of detainees from Camp Bastion to the Afghan authorities, which compelled the British military to keep so many prisoners in detention in the first place. In January 2010 he wrote on the Guardian\u2019s website: \u2018My firm\u2019s next case focuses on the UK\u2019s detention policy in Afghanistan, where we routinely hand over Afghans to the Afghan authorities in full knowledge of the torture, summary executions and disappearances occurring within their facilities.\u2019 Mr Shiner, 56, was a Birmingham University graduate who became an articled clerk and then a solicitor in the city. He worked for a decade for legal firms, a council estate project, a law centre and the Barnardo\u2019s charity before founding his own firm in 1999. The father of five is also a visiting professor at London Metropolitan University, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, and was awarded the title \u2018Human Rights Lawyer of the Year\u2019 in 2004. He has repeatedly denied that he is an \u2018ambulance chaser\u2019 and calls the idea that he trawls for work\u2018 laughable\u2019. His firm, Public Interest Lawyers, made its name in Iraq, where Mr Shiner represented alleged victims of abuses by British troops, including relatives of Baha Mousa, who died in 2003 in British custody. Nearly \u00a33million has been paid in compensation to the family of Mr Mousa and other men. Mr Shiner sent a representative to Iraq to find and interview people who claimed to have been harmed by the British, and their claims were brought to the British courts. Public Interest Lawyers says it is currently acting for more than 130 former detainees who allege that they or their family members were unlawfully detained, ill-treated, or killed by UK forces in Iraq. Controversial: The detention facility at Camp Bastion, where the BBC said up to 90 Afghans are held . The firm\u2019s interests are, however, not exclusively abroad.

But they shouldn't be. The collapse of the Iraqi government's troops in Mosul and other northern cities in the face of Sunni militant resistance has been the predictable culmination of a long deterioration, brought on by the government's politicization of its security forces. The politicization of the Iraqi military . For more than five years, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his ministers have presided over the packing of the Iraqi military and police with Shiite loyalists -- in both the general officer ranks and the rank and file -- while sidelining many effective commanders who led Iraqi troops in the battlefield gains of 2007-2010, a period during which al Qaeda in Iraq (the forerunner of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) was brought to the brink of extinction. Al-Maliki's \"Shiafication\" of the Iraqi security forces has been less about the security of Iraq than the security of Baghdad and his regime. Even before the end of the U.S.-led \"surge\" in 2008, al-Maliki began a concerted effort to replace effective Sunni and Kurdish commanders and intelligence officers in the key mixed-sect areas of Baghdad, Diyala and Salaheddin provinces to ensure that Iraqi units focused on fighting Sunni insurgents while leaving loyal Shiite militias alone -- and to alleviate al-Maliki's irrational fears of a military coup against his government. In 2008, al-Maliki began replacing effective Kurdish commanders and soldiers in Mosul and Tal Afar with Shiite loyalists from Baghdad and the Prime Minister's Dawa Party, and even Shiite militia members from the south. A number of nonloyalist commanders were forced to resign in the face of trumped up charges or reassigned to desk jobs and replaced with al-Maliki loyalists. The moves were made to marginalize Sunnis and Kurds in the north and entrench al-Maliki's regime and the Dawa Party ahead of provincial and national elections in 2009, 2010 and 2013. The dismantling of the 'Awakening' It's no accident that there exists today virtually no Sunni popular resistance to ISIS, but rather the result of a conscious al-Maliki government policy to marginalize the Sunni tribal \"Awakening\" that deployed more than 90,000 Sunni fighters against al Qaeda in 2007-2008. These 90,000 \"Sons of Iraq\" made a significant contribution to the reported 90% drop in sectarian violence in 2007-2008,  assisting the Iraqi security forces and the United States in securing territory from Mosul to the Sunni enclaves of Baghdad and the surrounding Baghdad \"belts.\" As the situation stabilized, the Iraqi government agreed to a plan to integrate vetted Sunni members of the Sons of Iraq into the Iraqi army and police to make those forces more representative of the overall Iraqi population. But this integration never happened. Al-Maliki was comfortable touting his support for the Sons of Iraq in non-Shiite areas such as Anbar and Nineveh provinces, but he refused to absorb Sunnis into the ranks of the security forces along Shiite-Sunni fault lines in central Iraq. In areas with (or near) Shiite populations, al-Maliki saw the U.S.-backed Sons of Iraq as a threat, and he systematically set out to dismantle the program over the next four years. As this process played out, we saw its effects firsthand in our interactions with Iraqi government officials and tribal leaders in Baghdad, where it was clear the Sons of Iraq were under increasing pressure from both the government and al Qaeda. By 2013, the Sons of Iraq were virtually nonexistent, with thousands of their sidelined former members either neutral or aligned with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in its war against the Iraqi government. The disappearance of the Sons of Iraq meant that few Sunnis in western and northern Iraq had a stake in the defense of their own communities. The vast system of security forces and Sunni tribal auxiliaries that had made the Sunni provinces of Iraq hostile territory for al Qaeda was dismantled. The militant gains in Mosul and other cities of the north and Anbar are the direct result of the removal of the Iraqi security forces commanders and local Sons of Iraq leaders who had turned the tide against al Qaeda in 2007-2008. Those commanders who had a reason to secure and hold territory in the north were replaced with al-Maliki loyalists from Baghdad who, when the bullets began to fly, had no interest in dying for Sunni and Kurdish territory. And when the commanders left the battlefield this week, their troops melted away as well. What can be done? The problem will only get worse in the coming months. Now that the Iraqi government's weakness in Sunni territories has been exposed, other Sunni extremist groups are joining forces with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  to exploit the opening. The Baathist-affiliated Naqshbandi Army and the Salafist Ansar al-Sunna Army are reportedly taking part in the offensive as well, and they are drawing support from a Sunni population that believes itself persecuted and disenfranchised by al-Maliki's government and threatened by Shiite militias that are his political allies. For six months, Shiite militants have been allowed or encouraged by the government to conduct sectarian cleansing in mixed areas around Baghdad, particularly in Diyala province between Baghdad and the Iranian border. These events contributed to the motivation of Sunnis who have taken up arms or acquiesced in the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria's offensive. Even as the ISIS tide rolls southward down the Tigris, there is probably little danger of Baghdad and other Shiite areas falling into Sunni insurgent hands. The Shiite troops unwilling to fight to hold onto Mosul will be far more motivated to fight to protect Shiite territories in central and southern Iraq and to defend the sectarian fault line. This is their home territory, where they have the advantage of local knowledge, and where they have successfully fought the Sunni insurgency for years. In the north, however, al-Maliki now has two military options. He can reconsolidate his shattered forces along sectarian fault lines to defend Shiite territories in central Iraq, ceding Sunni areas to the insurgency, or he can regroup his security forces at their bases north of Baghdad and mount expeditions to conduct \"cordon and search\" operations in Sunni areas lost to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. If al-Maliki chooses to regroup and move on Sunni population centers controlled by the ISIS, we are likely to see Shiite troops unfamiliar with Sunni neighborhoods employing heavy-handed tactics, bluntly targeting Sunni military-age males (12-60) not affiliated with the insurgency and further inflaming sectarian tensions as they do so -- reminiscent of the situation in many parts of Iraq in 2005-2006. The problem at its core is not just a matter of security, but politics. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and its allies would not have had the opportunity to seize ground in the Sunni Arab-dominated provinces of Salaheddin, Nineveh and Anbar if there had been more inclusive and sincere political outreach to the mainstream Sunni Arab community. In the end, the solution to the ISIS threat is a fundamental change in Iraq's political discourse, which has become dominated by one sect and one man, and the inclusion of mainstream Sunni Arabs and Kurds as full partners in the state. If al-Maliki truly wishes to restore government control to the Sunni provinces, he must reach out to Sunni and Kurdish leaders and ask for their help, and he must re-enlist former Sons of Iraq leaders, purged military commanders and Kurdish Peshmerga to help regain the territory they once helped the Iraqi government defend. But these are steps a-Maliki has shown himself unwilling and unlikely to take. At this point, al-Maliki does not have what it takes to address Iraq's problem -- because he is the problem."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The solution to the ISIS threat is inclusive political outreach to the mainstream Sunni Arab community.

Police continue to question a man arrested on suspicion of her abduction but said they urgently need help from the public to trace his movements during the crucial hours after April was snatched from a street Monday. Mark Bridger, 46, remains in police custody and will be questioned again Thursday, said Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan, of Dyfed-Powys Police. A team of officers is working around the clock to try to piece together Bridger's movements between Monday evening and his arrest Tuesday afternoon, Bevan said, using forensic analysis and witness statements. But, he said, more help is still needed from people who may have seen or spoken with Bridger at that time. \"We are appealing for anyone who has had contact with Mark; we don't have the complete picture yet,\" Bevan said. British Prime Minister David Cameron added his voice Thursday to the plea for information made by April's family, an unusual intervention by the country's leader in an ongoing police search. \"My heart goes out to April Jones's family. I appeal for anyone who saw or heard anything to talk to the police,\" he said via his official Twitter feed.

Tiger Woods looks on pensively during the second round of the\u00a0Waste Management Phoenix Open . The 14-time major winner struggled in Phoenix on the back-nine, shooting his equal worst nine-hole 44 . Woods, who struggled last year after having back surgery in March and took four months off from August to fully recover, expected to be a little rusty. But he had not planned on propping up the 132-man field, especially after comments before the tournament about feeling as good as ever under the direction of new swing consultant Chris Como. The 39-year-old hit a triple bogey, two double bogeys, six bogeys and just two birdies to close on 13-over-par. It was so bad that all he could do was try to laugh it off. \u2018I\u2019m just doing this so I don\u2019t get fined,\u2019 Woods joked in reference to Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch\u2019s infamous line at a Super Bowl media day this week. \u2018We all have days like this.

But even on bad days like this you just have to keep fighting.\u2019 Woods plays a difficult shot on his knee (left) and reacts after playing a stray shot (right) in Phoenix . Woods put most of the blame on adapting to changes in his swing. He said: \u2018I was caught between patterns, old pattern, new pattern.

The Little Rock Police Department arrested Arron Lewis, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, after an arrest warrant issued Sunday said he was charged with kidnapping. The warrant provided no other details, but Lt. Carl Minden with the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office said Lewis was a suspect in the disappearance of Beverly Carter. Carter went to show a home in the small community of Scott on Thursday. She then vanished. Pulaski County Sheriff Doc Holladay told reporters Monday morning that his investigators were questioning Lewis. When asked whether the suspect was talking, Holladay said: \"We will have to see how cooperative he is as the day progresses.\" Police haven't said how they linked Lewis to Carter or how they tracked him down, but they say Lewis left a hospital Sunday without notifying police while he was a person of interest in her disappearance. Suspect was in wreck . Lewis, who was on parole, was in a traffic accident Sunday, and police arrived to find his automobile on top of a concrete culvert, according to an accident report from the sheriff's office. Lewis told police that a vehicle, which he couldn't describe, had run him off the road. But a witness told police that he was behind Lewis before the accident, and \"Lewis was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to the crash,\" the report says. Another witness told police that \"the Lewis vehicle was going 'so fast' prior to the curve and she further stated that she observed the Lewis vehicle 'fishtail' around the curve, going into the ditch,\" according to the report. Paramedics took Lewis to Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock. A deputy followed the ambulance to the hospital to issue Lewis a citation for careless driving as well as not wearing his seat belt, because there was evidence Lewis hit the windshield during the crash, the report says. At that time, Lewis was a person of interest in the Carter investigation, but he was not under arrest, Minden said. \"While at the hospital and undergoing tests, Mr. Lewis left the hospital. He was not under the guard of law enforcement at that time due to not having any criminal charges at that point,\" the lieutenant said in a statement. The warrant charging him with kidnapping was issued later Sunday, he said. Dozens of volunteers -- as many as 200, according to authorities -- spent their Sunday searching for the missing woman in the Little Rock area. They resumed their search Monday in two areas in the southern part of the county, the sheriff said. \"At this point we don't know where she is,\" Holladay said. The search has focused on an area of flat farmland and swamp around the Arkansas River, Minden said. The Sheriff's Office has asked all owners of large tracts of land in the Scott area to search their properties. Official: Agent's cell phone used . The mysterious disappearance of the 49-year-old resonated among fellow real estate agents, who posted their fears on a Facebook page set up for sharing information about her case. Carter's last phone call to her husband came Thursday afternoon, telling him the address where she would be. When hours went by with no further word from her, Carl Carter says he \"knew something was wrong.\" Before calling authorities, Carl Carter went to the address of the home Beverly Carter was showing and saw her brown Cadillac parked there, the sheriff's office said. Noticing the property was open, the husband entered and searched for his wife without success, according to the Sheriff's Office. There has been activity on her cell phone since she disappeared, Minden said. Later he explained to HLN's Nancy Grace that included text messages, but he declined to elaborate on the nature of the texts. Beverly Carter, who according to her employer's website has been married for 34 years and has four grandchildren, was last seen wearing a black sleeveless shirt and red capris. \"I feel like I'm in a fog, or a horrible nightmare from which I can't awaken,\" Beverly Carter's son, also named Carl, wrote on a Facebook post. \"She needs us, and we must continue to pray (and) brainstorm ways to find her.\" The elder Carl Carter told CNN affiliate KARK-TV that \"I would just like to have my wife back.\" The social media hashtag #FindBeverly has gained steam, and the Facebook page about her disappearance was followed by more than 28,000 people as of Monday afternoon. Police say Lewis' Monday arrest isn't his first run-in with police. In addition to any charges he may face in Carter's disappearance, he has a criminal history in northwest Arkansas that includes felony theft of property, obstruction of government operations, failure to appear and unlawful removal of a theft device, Minden said in a statement. He's also faced charges from the Kansas City police and the Utah Department of Corrections, he said.

A violinist who killed herself days after testifying against her 'predatory' former choirmaster told her husband she felt she had been the one on trial, an inquest was told. Frances Andrade, 48, died at her home in Guildford, Surrey in January last year, just a week after giving evidence in court about historic sexual abuse by music teacher Michael Brewer. Woking Coroner's Court heard the mother-of-four had spiralled into 'incredible despair' after a friend reported Brewer to Surrey Police the previous January and she was asked to give a statement. Brewer, who taught at the prestigious Chetham's School of Music in Manchester before going on to direct the World Youth Choir, was later stripped of his OBE for services to music after being jailed for six years for five counts of indecent assault.\u00a0 His ex-wife, Hilary Kay Brewer, was also jailed for sexual abuse. Frances Andrade, 48, (L&R) killed herself after testifying against her former abuser, teacher Michael Brewer . The abuse happened when Mrs Andrade was a teenage pupil at Chethams School of Music, pictured . Mrs Andrade was just 14 and 15 when the abuse happened, but only came forward when she confided in a friend at a dinner party in 2011 and was alarmed that Brewer was still teaching. The court heard she was prescribed anti-depressants after talking to police, and had twice tried to take her own life in December 2012 and January 2013. Her husband, Levine Andrade, 59, found his wife, known as Fran, dead at 8am on January 24 last year. He said: 'She fell into incredible despair, the truth hit home. It was not something she wanted to report to the police. 'It brought back horrible memories from her past. 'Life took a real downturn after the court proceedings - that was when she was at her complete lowest. 'Apart from the trial bringing it all back up, she felt the defence barrister seemed to be attacking her personally. 'It got her completely down and she felt completely defenceless. I think she felt she was not prepared enough for the trial. She was not expecting to be attacked personally and have to answer so many direct questions in public. 'The words she used were: she felt as if she were the one on trial.' Brewer and his ex-wife, Hilary Kay Brewer, known as Kay, were jailed after being convicted of sexual abuse . The court also heard Mrs Andrade had met Brewer on two occasions since the abuse, and even asked him to hand himself in. Mr Andrade said his wife's mood changed after being asked to give a video interview for Surrey Police about the abuse she suffered, saying: 'She had very, very low mood swings and stayed in bed for days on end. She did not want to see anyone or speak to anyone.' He said she would come downstairs to make herself food, go back to bed, while he took on caring for the children and teaching as well. 'It was very out of character, she loved the children, absolutely adored them,' he said. 'It got harder and harder towards the last few months. She did not want to speak to anybody.' 'She had very, very low mood swings and stayed in bed for days on end.\u00a0 She did not want to see anyone or speak to anyone.' Levine Andrade on his wife, Frances . On the morning of her death, Mr Andrade, himself a musician and teacher, went to offer his wife a cup of tea and noticed she was cold. After phoning for an ambulance, one of the couple's sons attempted CPR but when paramedics arrived they pronounced her dead. Mr Andrade was also asked if there were any other issues that could have caused his wife's anxiety but said while family finances were a 'problem', it was only because they had used their savings to pay the children's school fees. Mrs Andrade, who was adopted, had also traced her birth mother to Canada but found out she had two forms of cancer. Mr Andrade said: 'She felt helpless that she was far away and could not do anything.' In April this year, a serious case review by Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board said Mrs Andrade's death 'could and should' have been prevented, and mental health services failed to recognise she was vulnerable as she made repeated suicide bids. Her death led to calls for the court system to improve how sexual abuse victims are treated. The inquest continues and is scheduled to run into next week.

Then at night she\u2019d be so loving and would curl up close to me on my bed. That\u2019s the thing I miss most, our snuggle time.\u2019 Mourning: Nicole Green, 38, is grieving for her cat Poppy, 15, who was diagnosed with dementia last December . Nicole, who is married to James, 31, a fireman, and has three children, Macey, 14, Archie, seven, and George, eight weeks, admits that she wells up when she reminisces about her pet. But Poppy isn\u2019t dead. She is one of more than 1.3\u2009million British cats and dogs with dementia, which has a devastating effect on their lives \u2014 and those of their owners. \u2018Every night it takes me two or three hours to try to settle her to sleep because she\u2019s so distressed and doesn\u2019t know where she is,\u2019 says Nicole. \u2018She\u2019ll miaow loudly and pace up and down for ages before she sleeps. \u2018In the morning I\u2019ll come downstairs and whereas before she used to jump off the table and come purring around my legs, now she simply doesn\u2019t respond. She just stares blankly back at me and it\u2019s obvious she has no idea who I am. It breaks my heart. \u2018She never used to have toilet accidents but now it happens most nights. Sometimes when the back door opens she will wander outside and I feel a huge sense of panic because if she gets lost, she won\u2019t be able to find her way home again. She can\u2019t even find her bowl.\u2019 Snuggle time: Nicole cuddling Poppy (left) and Poppy as a kitten (right) Recent research from the University of Edinburgh found that half of all cats over the age of 15 and a third of those aged 11 to 14 suffer from dementia. Another study found that 41\u2009per cent of dogs aged 14 and over and 23\u2009per cent of those aged 12 and over also suffer. Although most studies so far have focused on cats and dogs, owners are reporting behaviour similar to dementia in a variety of animals, including rabbits, guinea pigs and even parrots. If your pet is eight or older, and you answer yes to one or more of these questions, consult your vet: . Does your pet pace or wander aimlessly, finding it hard to settle? Does it stare blankly as if unaware of surroundings? Does it fail to recognise or respond to familiar people such as family and friends? Does it get lost or confused in the home or garden? Is it forgetful \u2014 for example, forgetting to go to the toilet or repeatedly seeking attention? Does it vocalise repeatedly or for no reason? The irony is that the disease is actually a result of domestic animals living beyond their natural life expectancy, as loving owners pay out for expensive food, medication and surgery to keep their pets alive. \u2018The main form of dementia in animals is called Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome, which is a degenerative brain disease remarkably similar to Alzheimer\u2019s in humans,\u2019 explains Jon Bowen, Honorary Lecturer in Small Animal Behaviour at the Royal Veterinary College, London. \u2018As with humans, areas of the brain stop working properly which leads to problems with learning, memory, sleep patterns, social interaction\u00a0 and continence.\u2019 Bowen believes that, just as humans are increasingly suffering from dementia due to our rising life expectancy, our pets are being stricken by the disease because they are living longer than ever. The average dog now lives to the age of 12 and a cat to 14. So, to some extent, animal-loving owners are responsible for the rise in dementia. \u2018Years ago we weren\u2019t seeing pets live until 17 or 18 years of age and nowadays we do,\u2019 says Mr Bowen. \u2018Their brains aren\u2019t evolved to live so long \u2014 they wear out.\u2019 The rise is so sudden that animal insurer Petplan recently revealed claims for vet appointments regarding dementia have increased by 23\u2009per cent for dogs and 48\u2009per cent for cats over the last three years. Michael Davies, Associate Professor in Small Animal Clinical Practice at the University of Nottingham, says \u2014 as with humans \u2014 experts are still in the dark as to why some animals are afflicted and not others. \u2018Loss of cognitive function with age in dogs and cats is associated with similar structural changes in the brain to people \u2014 an accumulation of a protein called amyloid in the brain tissue. \u2018The amyloid accumulates within the nerve cells in the brain, altering how it functions.\u2019 Heartache: Nicole says the affect of dementia on your pet, and your life as an owner, can be devastating . Nicole found out that Poppy had dementia . last December. Vets usually diagnose the condition after hearing about . the change in the pet\u2019s behaviour, and undertaking a full physical . examination and a range of tests. Loving friend: As Poppy is not in pain Nicole and her family plan to make her comfortable until the end . Putting down a pet with serious dementia may be an option, particularly if they are in physical pain or injuring themselves. However, it is not always the kinder option, as senile pets can live perfectly comfortable lives. \u2018Some days Poppy doesn\u2019t even remember what she likes eating any more,\u2019 says Nicole. \u2018A few weeks ago she left a bowl of her favourite cat food and went into the living room and lapped baked beans off my son\u2019s plate. She never liked them before. She also gets disorientated and walks round and round the garden like she\u2019s trying to get her bearings. \u2018Three months ago Poppy managed to squeeze through a gap in the fence and I found her wondering in the grounds of the local hospital looking lost. \u2018We were told that there\u2019s no medication we can give her.

It helps that we also have Darcie, a three-year-old schnoodle (a cross between a schnauzer and a poodle), and she encourages Zoe to get up and play. She even helps guide her round the house.\u2019 Elderly pets: Zoe is one of 300,00 dogs in the UK who suffer from the condition, with 41 per cent of dogs aged over 14 suffering and 23 per cent of those aged 12 and over .

I knew it\u00a0 was dementia.\u2019 Surprisingly, despite the rise in pet dementia, it often goes under-reported by vets. Symptoms: Alison recognised Toffee was suffering from dementia because he started displaying similar behavior to Alison's mother, a dementia sufferer . \u2018We may be detecting only about one in eight cases because signs of dementia just aren\u2019t visible in a consultation,\u2019 says Jon Bowen. \u2018We rely on owners to spot the signs and tell us.

Mr Cameron and other world leaders will go to the Elysee Palace first, before joining the rally. Mr Cameron's decision to attend the rally on Sunday comes after security chiefs warned that Britain was also being targeted by al-Qaeda terrorists. MI5 chief Andrew Parker said the terror group was plotting spectacular 'mass casualty' attacks on the UK. Following the warning, the Chancellor George Osborne said he had handed the security services a new \u00a3100million anti-terror fund to track British lone-wolf extremists. Mr Osborne said the cash had been handed over 'in the last few weeks' amid growing fears over the number of radicals returning from Iraq and Syria to wreak terror in Britain. He said the Government would provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need to prevent a terrorist atrocity in Britain. But Mr Parker, the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable that an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later. Warning:\u00a0Andrew Parker (pictured), the director-general of MI5, said it was almost inevitable an attack in Britain would succeed sooner or later . The Chancellor pledged to provide MI5 and MI6 with 'all the resources and all the legislation' they need . He said al-Qaeda was directing British-based fanatics from overseas to carry out attacks on airlines or a Mumbai-style gun and bomb atrocities. In a rare public speech, Mr Parker warned: 'Although we and our partners try our utmost, we know that we cannot hope to stop everything.' Mr Parker's speech, only his second since taking charge in April 2013, warned that the UK was facing a string of 'complex and ambitious plots' against the likes of transport networks and major landmarks. In response to the attack on the Paris-based satirical magazine on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said the threat to the UK was 'severe' \u2013 but insisted security chiefs would get whatever they needed. He said: 'It's clearly a big challenge for all countries including Britain and we face a terrorist threat. We have a severe terrorist threat; that is our national state of readiness. 'We have put a huge amount of planning and effort, from the police, from the security services, from the Government into anticipating what might try and happen, stopping some of these attacks and of course we have been successfully doing that over the last year. 'In the last few weeks we have put extra money, over a hundred million pounds into specifically monitoring people who are going to conflicts in Syria and Iraq. 'These sort of self-starting terrorists who get their ideas off the internet and then go and want to perpetrate horrendous crimes, so we are putting a huge effort in. 'As the director general of MI5 said over the last 24 hours, that is the threat we face and we face a threat from more complex plots.' Armed British police patrol St Pancras station in London, where the Eurostar train runs to Paris . Fanatics wish to emulate 'crude' attacks carried out overseas in recent months. Chillingly, tactics could include a 'hit-and-run' on a crowded public place using a lorry, van or car. Unlike gun or bomb plots, which involves buying weapons or equipment, such an attack would be hard for the security services to detect. At least three plots which would have involved 'certain deaths' in Britain have been foiled in recent months, Mr Parker said. Officials are also keeping tabs on up to 600 British extremists who have travelled to Syria \u2013 about 300 of who are now back home. Mr Osborne promised that the security services would get 'all the resources and all the legislation' necessary to prevent a terrorist attack in the UK. 'We have got to be vigilant, we have got to have the resources there and my commitment is very clear. This is the national priority. We will put the resources in, whatever the security services need they will get because they do a heroic job on our behalf. 'They often don't get praise, they don't often appear on sofas like this to talk about their work but they are absolutely in the front line with the police dealing with this threat and they will get the support they need and indeed in the last few weeks they have got that support.' 'Our national threat level is severe and that means we assess independently, it is not the politicians who make this assessment but the experts make this assessment, that an attack is highly likely. 'So, we have to be ready for that. We don't have specific intelligence that an attack is imminent or else we would increase the threat level, but we think it is highly likely and we have to be prepared. We have had terrible incidents on our streets.' Mr Osborne's remarks came amid warnings that amid warnings that the threat to Britain was now 'as serious as it has ever been' and the security services needed more powers to monitor fanatics. Former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, the chairman of the joint intelligence committee, said the security services must have the power to intercept communications between suspected terrorists in order to prevent future attacks. He said: 'What is emerging in Paris is that the two individuals responsible for the terrible massacre at Charlie Hebdo, may have been linked to Al Qaida in Yemen. 'Now they must have ben communicating with people in the Yemen over the last few days, over the last few weeks. 'The highly important objective is to enable the intelligence agencies in Britain, France and other democracies to be able to get hold of these communications to try and prevent incidents of this kind.'

There is also growing concern about the threat posed by ISIS fights returning to the UK. Radicalisation expert Shiraz Maher this morning told the BBC's Today programme that strict blasphemy laws in Muslim countries abroad were inflaming tensions in the West. He said stricter controls on what could be said about Islam and the prophet Muhammad 'affect some European Muslim's tolerance of satire'. Earlier, the Today programme heard from a number of British Muslims in High Wycombe who expressed anger at the journalists Charlie Hebdo for lampooning Islam. One Pakistani gentleman, Sajjad Haidyer, told the programme that the murdered journalists were 'not innocent'. He said: 'If the people make his cartoons or something else, they are hurting my heart. You can insult the peoples, you can insult me, you can insult anybody else \u2013 but not god, not the prophet Muhammad \u2013 we are not allowing that. 'If they are doing that, that will happen again and again.' He added: 'Some of these people were not innocent. The editor who makes the cartoons. He has no right to make cartoons or the prophet. He has no right to say Islam is bad.' Another elderly Muslim man said: 'Democracy doesn't mean you can go and insult anybody. Insulting somebody, you shouldn't allow that. What are they achieving with the cartoon \u2013 what is the point?' But another man in the town said people did not have the right to take people lives. 'What Islam means is peace, love,' he said.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\n(CNN) -- In January, Bashar al-Assad sat down for a long interview with the Wall Street Journal. That was noteworthy in itself; the Syrian leader doesn't spend much time with the Western media. He was in confident mood -- saying that Syria would not succumb to the unrest then spreading in Tunisia and Egypt. That same month Vogue ran an effusive feature on Syria's first lady, Asma al-Assad, describing her as a \"rose in the desert.\" But in his interview, al-Assad also recognized \"anger and desperation\" in the region and the need for reform in Syria, to \"open up the society,\" as he put it. Change was needed, he said, but \"if you do it just because of what happened in Tunisia and Egypt, then it is going to be a reaction, not an action; and as long as what you are doing is a reaction you are going to fail.\" Now, after 10 days of deadly protests in Syria, that \"reaction\" is well and truly under way. The government has responded with a mixture of aggression and appeasement. It has announced a substantial rise in wages for public employees, and has proposed ending the decades-long state of emergency and opening up Syria's cramped political space to other parties. The current Syrian constitution enshrines the leadership of the Baath Party, which both al-Assad and his father, Hafez al-Assad, who died in 2000, have led. At the same time, security forces have swamped Daraa and other towns in the south; witnesses speak of a mysterious group of men dressed in black patrolling the streets of Latakia. Amnesty International reports widespread arrests of political activists. But the protests have continued, and one Facebook page following the unrest -- SyrianRevolution -- now has nearly 100,000 followers. The regime's carrot-and-stick approach may work in the short term but the widely respected International Crisis Group says President Assad has two starkly different options. \"One involves an immediate and inevitably risky political initiative that might convince the Syrian people that the regime is willing to undertake dramatic change. The other entails escalating repression, which has every chance of leading to a bloody and ignominious end. \" While it has tinkered with reform over the past 10 years, al-Assad's government is hamstrung by internal disagreement, endemic corruption and competing goals at home and in the region. That at least is the picture that emerges from analyzing the U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks. The cables acknowledge that al-Assad has allowed greater media freedom since he became president 11 years ago \"with Al Jazeera, the local favorite, and al-Arabiya readily available via satellite.\" Local journalists spoke of shifting red lines, adding wryly that \"it was much simpler under Hafez al-Assad; we always knew where the red lines were.\" Caution has been the watchword in other spheres, including a tentative \"reset\" of Syria's frosty relationship with the United States since President Barack Obama took office and a gradual reassertion of Syria's role in Lebanon. The younger al-Assad has blamed a rough neighborhood for slow progress at home. \"We are not the only captain,\" he told the Wall Street Journal. \"We were affected by the situation in Iraq or in Lebanon. There are many things that we wanted to do in 2005 we are planning to do in 2012.\" The cables shed light on how Syria has been run -- with powerful and often competing cliques dominating economic and political life, and intrigue trumping open debate. Part of the diplomatic traffic is devoted to the power of \"regime financiers\" like telecom magnate Rami Makhluf, al-Assad's cousin. A U.S. contact is quoted in a cable as saying \"most Syrians viewed Rami in a negative light and his strong-arm business tactics had earned him many enemies.\" The same cable says corruption \"was rife in Syrian government and society and had undermined the president's credibility with the Syrian people.\" There is also evidence of serious rifts within the security apparatus, with one cable from 2008 reporting that \"Syrian Military Intelligence and General Intelligence Directorate officials are currently engaged in an internecine struggle to blame each other for the breach of security\" that occurred in Damascus when Hezbollah's military commander, Imad Mughniyah, was killed by a car bomb. Several months later, a top adviser to al-Assad -- Gen. Mohammed Suleiman -- was shot dead at his vacation home on the Syrian coast. His killers have never been identified, although the Syrians blame Israel. Syria's long-term alliance with Iran and its sponsorship of the Hezbollah militia in neighboring Lebanon are also sensitive issues at home. Some reports from Daraa say protesters have raised their voices against both. Syrian officials quoted in U.S. cables say Hezbollah is a legitimate resistance movement and part of the overall Middle East peace process. In other words -- Syria's (and Iran's) insurance card against Israel. In 2009, the top U.S. diplomat in Damascus sharply criticized Syria's alleged delivery of ballistic missiles to Hezbollah. \"Syria's actions have created a situation in which miscalculation or provocative behavior by Hezbollah could prove disastrous for Syria and the broader region,\" he wrote. Other cables suggest constant juggling by al-Assad as he tries to keep the alliance with Iran intact while not closing the door to negotiations with Israel. Fawaz Gerges at the London School of Economics says Syria is a critical regional player. \"Instability in Syria means there will be instability in Lebanon, which is a divided country along sectarian lines.\" Iran, too, would be affected were Assad to go, he said: \"Syria is a critical player that supports a non-Arab state. The West has tried to wean Syria off Iran but has failed.\" Barak Seener, a research fellow with the Royal United Services Institute in London, agrees that events in Syria could alter the Middle East landscape. \"A liberal democratic Syria would be more susceptible to peace with Israel, irrespective of the status of the Golan Heights,\" he said. \"In light of the opposition that removed Mubarak, it is questionable whether peace can be made with autocratic leaders that can be removed and not with liberal societies.\" Seener says the violence so far does not threaten the regime's existence but \"will embolden the majority-Sunni population and Kurdish minority, who deeply resent the political dominance of the Alawi minority, to protest.\" Al-Assad is an Alawite. But so far, none of Syria's major cities has seen the sort of unrest witnessed in Daraa. Some Syria-watchers say al-Assad may even turn the crisis to his advantage by pushing through reform despite the hardliners and bureaucratic inertia. He may also benefit from a fractured opposition. Syrian analyst Murhaf Jouejati at George Washington University says that civil society has been stifled by decades of emergency rule. \"The protesters are not organized. The opposition is fragmented,\" he said. \"Civil society is not developed enough to be a counterweight to the state\" even if intellectuals leading the opposition enjoy a certain amount of moral authority. Other analysts say the sudden announcement of extensive concessions smacks of panic, and that endemic corruption and high unemployment are beyond the government's capacity to fix. In addition, as the International Crisis Group notes, \"as a result of events elsewhere in the region, a new awareness and audacity have materialized over the past several weeks in myriad forms of rebelliousness.\" Fear, if not gone, is no longer so pervasive. The International Crisis Group says much hinges on al-Assad, who is due to address the nation in the next couple of days. \"He alone can prove that change is possible and already in the making, restore some sense of clarity and direction to a bewildered power apparatus and put forward a detailed framework for structural change,\" it says. As al-Assad also told the Wall Street Journal in January: \"This is the Middle East, where every week you have something new.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bashar al-Assad dismissed the possibility of unrest in Syria in a January interview.

Liverpool is the whiplash capital of Britain with one in every 50 residents making compensation claims. Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show huge regional variations in case rates \u2013 clear evidence of fraud in the eyes of industry experts. Whiplash claims cost insurers\u00a0 \u00a32billion a year, with bogus payouts adding \u00a390 to the typical car insurance premium. Whiplash: Bogus claims cost the insurance industry \u00a32\u00bfbillion a year and have raised the annual insurance premium for every motorist by \u00a390 . In the 12 months to March, the number of cases in Liverpool was 22 per thousand residents. Uxbridge in West London and Oldham were close behind with 21 and 20 per thousand. Those figures are twice the national average of nine per thousand and 20 times the level seen in some areas. The lowest rates were in Scotland, where there are strict controls on referral fees paid to garages and insurance brokers in such cases. A survey of GPs last year showed that 25 per cent of the 550,000 annual claims are \u2018fake or over-diagnosed\u2019. At least 30,000 \u2013 6 per cent \u2013 are outright fraudulent, according to the Insurance Fraud Bureau.UK insurers receive 1,200 whiplash claims a day, twice the level in other European countries. Malcolm Tarling, of the Association of British Insurers, said: \u2018This is the first time there has been a regional breakdown of where whiplash claims are being made. \u2018And there appears to be a striking correlation between whiplash victims and the number of lawyers specialising in personal injuries claims. \u2018Whiplash claims have gone up by a third in the past three years while the number of accidents has gone down. \u2018Either we have developed the weakest necks in Europe or drivers are regarding whiplash injury claims as easy money waiting to be collected.\u2019 Aviva has called for a radical overhaul of the system, saying the compensation culture encourages bogus claims. Dominic Clayden, claims director for the insurer, said: \u2018We operate in a legal system that encourages claimants to \u201chave a go\u201d \u2013 there is no financial risk for even the most minor whiplash claim to be brought. 'However, this \u201cwhip-cash\u201d is not free. It is not coincidence that premiums have increased as whiplash claims have skyrocketed over recent years. \u2018The UK needs urgent reform of the system so genuine claimants get the compensation and help they deserve, but minor incidents that hardly give rise to an injury are not penalising motorists through inflated premiums. Crackdown: The nationwide issue was brought to light by Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke who has held a 'Whiplash Summit' in Parliament in a bid to crack down on the crooks . \u2018The Ministry of Justice needs to increase the small claims limit to \u00a35,000, meaning that minor whiplash claims would not need to involve lawyers. We also believe that the damages paid for whiplash injuries need to be reduced and capped.\u2019 But John Spencer, of personal injury specialist Spencer\u2019s Solicitors, said: \u2018There are some cases that are spurious and fraudulent and every professional legal firm wants to put a stop to that. \u2018But you have got to make sure that people who are injured are properly compensated.\u2019 Last night a Department for Transport spokesman said: \u2018Car insurance costs are simply too high, they must be reduced. \u2018The Government has already taken tough action to ban referral fees, reform no win no fee rules and crack down on fraudulent whiplash claims. \u2018But we must go further and by working together with drivers and the industry the Government is determined to bring some common sense back and get premiums down.\u2019 Whiplash is caused when the head moves suddenly, damaging ligaments and tendons in the neck \u2013 a common injury in a car accident.

Leyrtiz had faced up to six months in jail after his November conviction for driving under the influence, but he was spared the prospect of up to 15 years in prison when jurors acquitted him of DUI manslaughter. \"I am telling you now that if you violate probation, I will give you the maximum jail sentence,\" Broward County Circuit Judge Marc Gold told Leyritz on Thursday. Leyritz was convicted of driving drunk in the December 2007 accident that killed 30-year-old Freida Veitch. The wreck occurred after he had spent his 44th birthday with friends in Fort Lauderdale bars, and tests after the accident indicated he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.14 percent -- well above Florida's legal limit of 0.08. \"That night -- my birthday -- and every year, I will remember that night, your honor,\" a tearful Leyritz told the judge. Leyritz played most of his 11-season major-league career with the Yankees, hitting a clutch home run against the Atlanta Braves in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series that helped propel New York to the championship. He also played with the San Diego Padres in the 1998 World Series against the Yankees. Prosecutors had argued for four months jail time in addition to a year of probation, but defense attorney David Bogenschutz argued that the offense was the first for Leyritz. Gold also imposed a $500 fine, the state's maximum, and revoked Leyritz's drivers license for six months. The victim's husband, Jordan Veitch, said Leyritch's conduct \"shows a lack of respect or the lives of others.\" Freida Veitch also was drunk -- with a 0.18 blood alcohol level -- and was not wearing her seat belt, according to court documents. Jordan Veitch acknowledged that his wife could have faced charges had she survived, but, \"She did not have an opportunity to be judged.\" \"Mr. Leyritz will be able to kiss and hug his children again. He will be able to go on being a parent,\" Jordan Veitch said. \"Frieda will never have that chance to do any of these things again.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jim Leyritz, an ex-Yankees catcher, was put on probation for a year and had his license revoked for six months for a 2007 DUI accident that killed 30-year-old Freida Veitch in Florida.

Police officers were investigating a reported marijuana-growing operation when they discovered a homemade bomb and bomb-making materials in a suitcase, the news release said. Vladislav Miftakhov, a Russian citizen, was arrested and charged with possessing a weapon of mass destruction, risking a catastrophe and drug-related offenses. He was arraigned Friday and bail was set at $500,000, Blair County corrections officer James McMahon said Sunday. According to a criminal complaint, police found one pound of atomized magnesium and one pound of Chinese potassium perchlorate along with a package labeled potassium nitrate powder. They also found fuses and several containers of compressed air. When asked what he was going to do with two devices that were found with exposed fuses, Miftakhov said \"he was going to blow things up,\" the complaint alleges. Miftakhov later said he only intended to set devices off in a field and wasn't going to blow anything up, the document says. He told police that he had previously experimented with other homemade explosives in California. Authorities found five marijuana seedlings and a grow light, the complaint says. Miftakhov will next appear in court on February 5. He will be assigned a public defender, McMahon said. The Pennsylvania State Police bomb squad \"safely deconstructed\" the device, officials said. According to the release, Miftakhov told officers that he had purchased materials for the bomb on the Internet. A man who lived in the same building told CNN affiliate WTAJ that Miftakhov was \"the weirdest individual that I've ever met,\" but Andrew Leff added that he didn't think Miftakhov had done anything dangerous before. Leff told the Altoona Mirror, which identified him as an apartment-mate, that Miftakhov had recently set off three small homemade bombs outside the apartment, leaving small craters in the ground. Another roommate, Steven Taylor, said Miftakhov was quiet. \"He barely talked,\" he told the newspaper.

A neglected dog has been put down by a vet who described it as suffering with the worst case of starvation he had ever seen. Fly, a 15-year-old lurcher, lost half her body weight, down to only 8.1kg, and shocked vets with her horrendous condition. The dog's owner, David Lowe, 33, was summoned to appear at Bolton Magistrates' Court, to face charges of animal cruelty, on February 24, but failed to turn up. However, the case was proved in his absence and he was convicted of five counts of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal in October 2013.

When Fly was found, she was suffering from an abscess in its mouth, overgrown nails, a severe dental disease and had discharge oozing from a sinus beneath its eye. Vets later found that Fly also had a mammary tumour and was diabetic. The RSPCA took custody of Fly that same day but, after examination, vets decided the most humane course of action was to put the dog down. RSPCA inspector Vicki McDonald said: 'Fly was the thinnest dog I or the vet had ever seen. 'She was in such a terrible state, with so many issues, that the vet took the difficult decision to put her to sleep there and then. Of course we would have loved her to have recovered, but this was the kindest thing to do. 'At 15 years old she was an elderly dog but she was not in this condition because of her age, she was in this condition because she had been badly neglected.' The court heard how Lowe had been given \u00a320 to take the dog to the vets for treatment but failed to do so, fearing she would be put down. The dog could have been 'easily . treated' if help had been sought earlier, the court heard, but she was . put down after being found in a 'severely emaciated condition'. Fly could have been 'easily treated' if taken to a vet sooner but had deteriorated so much nothing could be done . Fly had been starved down to weighing only 8.1kg, half of what a healthy 15-year-old lurcher should weigh .

A former teacher has revealed how she leapt from a cliff edge to save her 19-month-old son after he fell over the side as they chased butterflies. Melanie Liu feared the worst when she saw her youngest son Eli slip off the edge as they enjoyed a picnic at a beauty spot in Whitby, North Yorkshire. The cliff has a drop of some 65 feet to a concrete car park, but luckily Eli was unhurt because he landed in a bush about 15 feet down. Safe and sound: Melanie Liu hugs her 19-month-old son Eli (left) after he survived falling off a cliff at Spion Kop in Whitby by landing in a bush (right) Ms Liu jumped down to him, breaking her fall slightly by grabbing grass and digging her nails into the cliff face. Ms Liu, 39, who runs a guest house with her husband Bill, 44, said the incident happened on Spion Kop in Whitby last Saturday. She said they had been following butterflies with her little lad at what she thought was a safe distance. But the thick grass and vegetation at the spot made it seem to her that they were two feet from the edge, when in fact they were much closer. Ms Liu, a mother of two, said she had a firm hand on the hood of Eli\u2019s jacket but as the child took one more step towards the edge - a distance she thought was too close - he disappeared over the side. 'It was just the worst moment of my life, he somersaulted twice and landed on a shrub about 15 feet down,' she said. 'As he dropped I jumped, you just don\u2019t think about it at the time. It was a maternal instinct. 'They say your whole life flashes before your eyes but it was his death that flashed before mine, I was afraid of what I would see when I found him. 'I know what was at the bottom of that cliff. It was a terrifying moment.' She said she stopped beside her son, who had started crying as soon as he landed in the bush.

'After 10 minutes he was fine but I was in shock and started being sick and shaking. My heart was hammering. 'It was around five minutes from when Eli fell until I got him back to safety but it seemed like hours. 'There are only one or two of those shrubs on the side of the cliff. It is so lucky that he landed on one. 'As soon as Eli fell I started screaming and was still screaming when I jumped over the side but I hadn\u2019t realised it.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\nIn the space of two weeks, two different courts have come to two different results in evaluating the legality of two similar voter identification laws. In Pennsylvania, a state trial judge upheld the newly enacted voter ID law under the state's constitution, while Thursday in Washington, a federal panel rejected Texas' similar ID law under the federal Voting Rights Act. Despite their differences, both courts were quite right to agree on a central proposition:  We really don't know how large an impact these voter ID laws will have on elections.  In the end, the question, both legal and moral, often boils down to who should have the burden of proof: Should states be forced to show their laws are justified because they prevent demonstrable fraud or should opponents be forced to show that the law prevents large numbers of people from voting? Voter ID cases often pit an invisible plaintiff against an imaginary problem.  It is difficult to find voters who absolutely cannot vote because of an ID law, just as it is challenging to find instances of the type of fraud such laws intend to prevent. The plaintiffs are invisible because very few people have the means to bring the federal case to challenge such laws but don't have the ability to navigate the barriers at the Department of Motor Vehicles to get an actual ID. Also, although we do know about 10% of Americans might not have the ID necessary to vote, we don't know how many won't vote specifically because of this extra burden, how many will be motivated to get an ID or how many will resort to absentee ballots, which do not require ID. In the Pennsylvania case, the lawyers had the perfect plaintiff, Viviette Applewhite, a 93-year-old, wheelchair-bound African-American woman who had no driver's license and no birth certificate because she was born at home. For such people, getting the required documents can be burdensome and sometimes expensive.  For Applewhite, unlike most of us, exercising her right to vote was worth the fight in court. (Did I mention she also marched with Martin Luther King Jr.?)  It also turned out that once she lost her case, she was able and willing to get through the bureaucratic maze necessary to get her ID. The moral of the story:  If you are one of those people who considers voting a right worth dying for, you'll most likely be able to do what is necessary to get to vote.  Such is not the case, however, if you are one of the unfortunate few who can never get the right documents you need. Or if you're one of the great many nonvoters for whom any additional hindrance makes you think it's not worth it -- that the added costs of registering and voting exceed the intangible benefit of knowing you have participated in the democracy. Even after an election takes place, another reason makes plaintiffs difficult to find and the effect of voter ID laws uncertain: It's unclear whether the laws are actually enforced as intended.  For any number of election regulations, there's a huge gap between the law on the books and the practices in the polling place. When the poll worker's neighbor shows up without an ID, the odds are that she might let him vote anyway -- that is, assuming he has been neighborly.  Of course, that might not happen if she doesn't recognize him or she has trouble understanding his accent. Indeed, political scientists find that huge numbers of voters in states even without ID laws report being asked for photo ID on Election Day.  And at least one election administrator in Pennsylvania has even pledged not to enforce the new law. Against the invisible plaintiffs in these cases is the imaginary problem of voter impersonation fraud -- the kind of fraud where someone goes to the polling place and votes using the name of someone else. Even though we have few documented cases and prosecutions, make no mistake about it:  Voter impersonation does happen.  It probably happens with the same frequency as voters collapsing in line while waiting to vote, or getting nauseous when they see the names on the ballot.  And yes, if every election were to be a replay of the 2000 election, then any mishap -- fraudulent or otherwise -- could determine the outcome.  As of yet, however, we have not required all polling places to be prepared with smelling salts. The reason voter impersonation fraud is so rare is that it is an incredibly stupid and inefficient way to rig an election. Shepherding hordes of fraudsters from one polling place to the next to vote in other people's names would take a lot of time and effort and expose them to trouble with the law with little potential payoff.  Successful fraud  is usually perpetrated at the wholesale, rather than retail, level. Absentee ballots, in particular, have proven to be the fraudster's method of choice.  They are cast in private out of the view of suspecting eyes of poll workers or fellow voters.  They are ripe for coercion and undue influence from whoever might be sitting next to the absentee voter -- think union or corporate bosses.  And multiple ballots can be collected over the course of several weeks, saving the expense and rush of a one-day voter impersonation campaign. The greatest irony of the new crop of voter ID laws is that they do nothing to combat the more frequent problem of absentee ballot fraud. In fact, they might even make such fraud more likely because the number of absentee voters might increase, given that absentee voters do not need to have a photo ID in order to vote.  Worse still, absentee votes are much more likely to be otherwise disqualified because of errors committed by either the voter or the vote counter. They present the perfect storm of fraud and mistakes that conjures up images of the cockeyed Florida vote counters in the 2000 election. I happen to be in the camp that believes a state should provide a compelling justification for new election laws even if they have an admittedly uncertain effect on voters' rights.  But you do not need to be a fellow traveler or even to be preoccupied with voting rights to worry about the implications of these laws. Enforcement of these laws will be spotty.  They will cause confusion in the polling place as relatively untrained, volunteer poll workers come up to speed with sometimes complicated new regulations.  Some voters will choose not to vote, while others will cast provisional ballots -- so-called because the legality of the vote will be determined after Election Day if the voter can come up with ID in time for the ballot to be counted. This will all be done in the name of preventing voter fraud. Yet if these laws lead unwittingly to an increase in the number of voters casting absentee votes out of public view, then they will not even have addressed the fraud they intend to solve.  Indeed, they might even make it worse.

The burden of proof is contested: should states justify their laws or opponents prove they hinder voting? The laws often pit invisible plaintiffs, like Viviette Applewhite, against voter impersonation fraud, a rare occurrence. Ironically, these laws do nothing to combat absentee ballot fraud, a more common issue, and may even increase it. Moreover, enforcement of these laws is often inconsistent."}]}

A conman plunged a kitchen knife into his housemate's neck  at his luxury Mayfair apartment before screaming 'you're going to die' as the alleged victim begged for mercy, the Old Bailey has heard. Darren Scott, 26, allegedly slashed the man's throat midway through a friendly massage, before stabbing him repeatedly\u00a0in a scene 'straight out of a horror movie'. The victim, a writer - who cannot be named for legal reasons - managed to break free from the frenzied attack and lock himself in the bathroom, while blood was gushing from his wounds, the court was told. He then banged on the door shouting 'murder', before pleading with Scott to call an ambulance. But Scott screamed \u2018you\u2019re going to die\u2019 before throwing a chair at the bathroom door and trying to kick his way through, the court heard. Scott, who had moved into the plush London flat just two weeks earlier, was later arrested while socialising in a jazz bar in Brough, near Hull. The court heard he had used his alleged victim's bank card to pay for the \u00a3280 train fare. Prosecutor John Clifford told the Old Bailey how the alleged victim had feared Scott was a \u2018psychopath\u2019 due to his 'big, staring eyes'. But he had still allowed him to move into his flat, just one day after they had met online, in July last year. After he had moved in, Scott began taking pictures of the apartment and sending them to his friends, claiming it was paid for by his new employers Procter and Gamble, the court was told. But it later emerged Scott had forged documents, falsely claiming that he worked for the company. Another document showed a \u00a3420,000 payment into a bank account that did not exist, the court was told. Scott also allegedly used his new friend\u2019s bank card to pay for the train trip to Hull, as well as to go on a \u00a31,700 spending spree at House of Fraser. The court was told how the alleged incident unfolded after Scott offered to give his new friend a massage at around 9am on July 3 last year. Midway through, Scott said he was going to get some salt water from the kitchen, the court heard. He then allegedly told his friend to lie on his back and put a t-shirt over his face, before changing the soothing music to \u2018quite loud and angry\u2019 sounds. Mr Clifford told the court: \u2018It was then that (he) became aware that Mr Scott began tapping, trying to find a vein in his neck\u2019. 'The next thing he was aware of, he had been stabbed without warning by Mr Scott in the neck. \u2018Immediately he tried to get up using his arms to protect himself from the blows of the knife which continue to rain down upon him.\u2019 Scott, of no fixed address, is on trial at the Old Bailey (pictured) and denies attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud . Mr Clifford said the victim struggled free and locked himself in the en-suite bathroom, while he had blood gushing from his neck. He said: \u2018At this stage, he had blood quite literally gushing from his wounds, over the door to the bedroom, over the floor, over the inside of the shower - it was something you would only expect to see in a horror movie. \u2018Having managed to get inside the en-suite bathroom, he became aware of a loud crashing sound as if something had been thrown against the door. \u2018He was in a state of panic with blood gushing from his wounds to the neck, to the nine stab wounds to the upper part of his body, to the 12 other injuries to his arms and hands, banged on the bathroom wall, crying \u201cmurder\u201d repeatedly. \u2018Alas, these cries were not answered by anyone at all. During this time, Mr Scott was just outside the door screaming: \u201cYou\u2019re going to die\u201d.\u2019 Mr Clifford said the trapped victim tried to reason with Scott, but the knifeman instead broke down crying and refused to call for help. He then said something 'very significant', Mr Clifford told the court. \u2018He said: \u201cIf you die, then I will get life, but if you live then I\u2019ll only get 14 years\",' he said. \u2018That was a very chilling and sinister remark to make, something which you may think says a lot about Mr Scott\u2019s state of mind on that day.\u2019 In the aftermath of the alleged attack, Scott told his friends he had been attacked by potential investors who had pulled out a knife. He took a train to Brough near Hull to stay with a friend, but was arrested the next day while socialising in a jazz bar in the town. After his arrest, detectives unravelled a web of deception that Scott had left in his wake, the court was told. Mr Clifford said the victim had \u2018thought Scott was a psychopath' after they had been living together for just a few days, but dismissed the thought because he was \u2018intrigued by Scott\u2019. \u2018It was during this time that Mr Scott was in effect ingratiating himself to (his victim), and indeed was not only using his bank cards but was taking pictures of the flat, a well-appointed flat on three floors in Mayfair, sending it to his friends, and in effect saying look at my new place, look at how well I\u2019ve done for myself,' Mr Clifford told the court. 'That\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg with regards to the deception carried out by Mr Scott.\u2019 Mr Clifford said Scott had a forged job offer from Procter and Gamble and a bogus letter from the courts service saying he had been given \u00a3420,000 in compensation. The jury also heard Scott had been \u2018helping himself\u2019 to his alleged victim's bank cards. \u2018It is alleged that Mr Scott abused his bank card to purchase train tickets, first class, from London back to Hull where his parents lived at a cost of \u00a3280.50\u2019, he said. \u2018Mr Scott has pleaded guilty to using a House of Fraser bank card to make purchases in the order of \u00a31700.\u2019 He also had a set of keys with the address of another Mayfair flat written on the fob, the court heard. Scott, of no fixed address, denies attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud.

The winning bidder, who went by the online name of 'gorpetri,' failed to make good on the deal, which led New York City Housing Works thrift shop desperate for another taker. The original painting featuring a serene landscape was purchased from Housing Works a few months ago. It was then returned with the addition of a Nazi officer sitting on a bench, taking in the scene with Banksy's signature in the corner. After discovering the artist behind . their latest acquisition, the thrift shop, which benefits the homeless . and those suffering from HIV/AIDs, decided to sell the painting,'The Banality of the Banality of Evil,' at . an auction. Less than a week after British street artist Banksy's painting of a Nazi officer into a landscape of a mountain lake sold for $615,000, the buyer backed out. Bidding started off at $74,000 but sold way above that at $615,00 to 'gorpetri,' who then was unable to come up with the funds to pay his winning bid. Housing Works immediately went in search of another taker. According to Gawker the thrift store contacted the next highest bidder, who refused to pay a . bid that had been placed in competition with a fraud.' Other bidders wondered if 'gorpetri' was actually the elusive British graffiti artist playing another prank to drive up prices. They also started to complain that Housing Works was not telling the truth about how the painting made it's way to their store. People gather outside the Housing Works Thrift Shop on 23rd Street in New York City to get a glimpse of Banksy's painting - 'The Banality of the Banality of Evil.' Wil Emlingman, from Minneapolis who bid on behalf of a private buyer, told TPM that he is suspicious of Housing Works. 'They were in on it all along. They knew. Actually, Banksy's people actually contacted them saying, 'Hey, we're looking for a landscape piece, we want to paint a monster on it,' Emling said. 'So the whole story about somebody buying it weeks ago and then somebody coming and dropping it off and telling them, 'I need to speak with the manager, you have a very expensive piece on your hands here,' isn't the case.' But Housing Works and Banksy's PR team deny all of the claims. A spokesperson from Housing Works said that they had no idea who the man was when he dropped off the 'vandalized' painting last month. 'I don't know all the details, it was all done very secretively. But someone came in and dropped it off as an anonymous donation,' Housing Work's Rebecca Edmondson told The New York Post. The thrift store was able to eventually find a buyer. They sold the painting to an anonymous individual who paid 'at least $450,000,' according to Gawker. Before the auction, Housing Works hung the painting in their store on 23rd Street. Bidding started off at $74,000 but sold way above that at $615,00 to 'gorpetri,' who then was unable to come up with the funds to pay his winning bid. 'It was one of the largest gifts Housing Works has ever received and we're thrilled,' Housing Work's chief development officer, Matthew Bernardo, told TPM. 'We're thankful that he chose us as an emblem of New York to give his donation to.' The charity donation marked the conclusion of the British artist's self-imposed 'residency' in New York, where he debuted a new piece of art every day during the month of October. Banksy ended his month-long residency on the streets of New York with an inflatable tag on the Long Island Expressway in Queens. The last piece from Better Out Than In sits above other tags in a used car lot. Cops took down the balloons. One exception was made on October 23 when he posted on his website that the day's art had 'been cancelled due to 'police activity'. The philanthropic turn came after he penned an op-ed slamming the 'Freedom Tower' design that is replacing The World Trade Center.

The 58-year-old recently trailed Jay-Z for an upcoming documentary he's directing about the rapper's role in the Budweiser Made in America Festival due out in 2013; he's mentoring James Murphy on his first directorial project; and he'll soon return as the narrator of the upcoming season of \"Arrested Development.\" Says Howard of the comedy series' new season, \"It's hilarious and it's also really bold in terms of the approach to catching the audience up on the characters, and simultaneously sort of weaving their stories in and around a new set of predicaments.\" So did you have fun hanging out with Jay-Z? I really did. The whole thing was interesting for me. I've never interviewed anybody, first of all. I'm pretty good at the initial instincts, and the very first time that I met [Jay-Z] some months back, we met with him in his office and there was just something that I really respected about him. I think he's pretty true to himself and pretty clear about what he thinks. Kind of the opposite of mercurial, I'd say. I don't know what the opposite of mercurial is, but he's I think tremendously focused. I've been around a lot of artists who are also good at business and . . . one minute they'll sound like an artist and the next minute they'll sound like the characters in \"Mad Men.\" Jay-Z's a very good businessman and he talks about it and enjoys it, but he doesn't shift. He has a sense of what he thinks people might appreciate, because he sort of trusts that if he appreciates it, there are people out there who will as well. And that's what's interesting to me: that he's accomplished in those areas but I don't hear that sort of cynical, world-weary quality. Jay-Z Gets Assist From Kanye at Made in America . And when he's onstage, the confidence he has with the microphone is pretty amazing. I got to watch in the pit, right on the edge on the stage. I understood something that I never even really had thought about before. He really communicates, whereas I think some of the other hip hop artists -- they were great performers and they were dynamic and charismatic -- but on a consistent basis, every idea seemed to be a communication. I always thought that about Sinatra. It's a connection. It's a story they're telling you. And I was kind of knocked out by that. I've never seen Eminem live, but in our movie, 8 Mile, I felt like that was happening. You interviewed Odd Future. What was that like? I like their videos. I'm laughing one minute, then my jaw drops the next. But I think they're so wild and great and I really like them. [Tyler, the Creator] and I just started talking and he just kept looking at me kind of like squinting and saying, \"You're sick. You're sick.\" [Laughs] I kind of knew it was a compliment, but I was joking later and said, \"I thought I looked fine!\" I was trying to describe them to somebody. It's kind of like there's the Marx Brothers and National Lampoon . . . this group chaos thing. It's pretty exciting to see that brand of anarchy and self expression adding up to so much. Jay-Z, actually, was really interested in them. He said to me that he, you know, Roc Nation, wanted to sign them and they went down the road discussing it, but ultimately Odd Future didn't want to be signed. They wanted to be self-reliant, self -contained. Were there any highlights from the festival? I think getting to talk to D'Angelo. Photos: Live at Made in America 2012 . That's a very rare interview. Yeah, and I don't think he's done very many. I wouldn't characterize it as probing, but, because it was on the subject of the event, I was glad to be able to share with him what I was hearing from everybody -- which is that everyone was so impressed with his reemergence and a kind of new level of musicianship. I heard that from several people. And I passed that along to him, so more than sort of the interview I was glad to be able to communicate that to him, and he was, I think, flattered to hear that. But you know, he's really focused and hard at it, and I think he's really glad to be out there. It was also fun to see Run-DMC. I talked to them both and they barely rehearsed. I remembered that when Henry Winkler and I, four years ago, did this Funny or Die sketch for Obama. It was so funny, because I was wearing this hair piece, Henry was wearing kind of Fonzie wig and we fell into it and I swear to God, I honestly d\u00c3\u00a9ja v\u00c3\u00bb'ed and thought I was back in the Arnold's parking lot doing a scene. It was so easy. So when I saw those guys, they just nailed it. I just thought, \"Well, yeah, you know, sometimes when a thing becomes a part of a fabric of your life, your history, that doesn't get so rusty.\" When you were younger, because of Happy Days and American Graffiti, people associated you with music of the Fifties and early Sixties. What do you listen to? I've never been much of a consumer and we didn't listen to much music in the home except kind of at Christmas time, so it was all Bing [Crosby] and Nat King Cole and the Everly Brothers. But it never became a passion. I didn't really listen to music when I was doing homework or when I when I work on a script. I tend to drift to NPR and news. It's interesting that you're working with James Murphy, too. Oh, yeah. My kids are grown, and I feel that I can afford the time to just be a little, you know, a little more experimental about what I do with my time away from the movies and the TV shows, which are still my main drive. James Murphy just came through this project, Canon's Imagination. This is year two of that, and last year we did it and my daughter Bryce directed the film, and people send in pictures targeting their own photographs for certain narrative categories. And then the public votes and they narrow it down to 10, and last year I chose one from each category and handed it over to Bryce and she had to direct a movie. And it was successful. It was a great creative experiment. With James Murphy, we wanted somebody from the music world, and of course he's so creative and visual and a really talented and intelligent guy. So I'm actually dying to see what he does with this exercise. I think I'm going to be inspired by him. Theoretically, I'm supposed to be offering some guidance and support, but I think he's one of the ones I'm sort of most curious about seeing work with this whole program. Would you ever work with Jay-Z again? I would do a documentary about Jay-Z. Yes, I would. I mean, that's not what this is particularly, but he's central to it. But if I had a chance and I thought I could do it justice, you know, I think he's a great subject. He's a great subject. Definitely. How is it going with \"Arrested Development\"? It's going great. There's a really good article that somebody did, an interview with Mitch Hurwitz. It's pretty funny. It's hilarious, and it's also really bold in terms of the approach to catching the audience up on the characters and simultaneously sort of weaving their stories in and around a new set of predicaments that are, you know, a brand new sort of five-alarm fires or however many alarms, whatever the maximum number of alarms is.

A former Labour Cabinet Minister hired by the BBC on a \u00a3295,000-a-year salary is spending thousands of pounds a week employing an outside consultant he used to work with. James Purnell, who resigned from Government in 2009 after an attempt to oust Gordon Brown, joined the Corporation as a director in March. The Mail on Sunday has learned that within weeks of his arrival he recruited 34-year-old ex-colleague Jean-Paul Petranca. Mr Purnell and Mr Petranca worked together at Boston Consulting Group, a global management consultancy,\u00a0 as recently as January. Last night the appointment was criticised by Conservative MP Alun Cairns, who said it raised serious questions about the BBC\u2019s employment practices. Neither the BBC nor Mr Petranca\u2019s company was willing to discuss the nature of his work for Mr Purnell, which is believed to be coming to an end after six months. But one insider estimated that the BBC has been paying the consultancy firm, which describes itself as the world\u2019s leading adviser on business strategy, about \u00a314,000 a week. Mr Cairns said: \u2018This sort of situation undermines recent commitments made by the BBC to be more transparent. There have already been questions about the manner of James Purnell\u2019s own appointment. \u2018For us to find out that he secretly recruited someone from his former company gives the BBC a bad name and raises further doubts about its openness and transparency.\u2019 Battle: Mr Purnell resigned in 2009 after an attempt to oust Gordon Brown . The news of Mr Petranca\u2019s BBC work comes weeks after it was revealed Mr Purnell had recruited another ex-colleague. Godric Smith, 48, one of Tony Blair\u2019s former spin doctors, is being paid \u00a3150,000 a year by the Corporation as a part-time PR adviser. The appointment infuriated Tory MPs as the BBC already has 140 staff in its PR department, with a salary bill of around \u00a35\u2009million. Mr Smith was hired to help restore the BBC\u2019s reputation after the scandal over Jimmy Savile and a \u00a325\u2009million redundancy bill for senior managers.

He is already the BBC\u2019s highest paid star. Now Jeremy Clarkson is set for a \u00a35million windfall after the Corporation bought out his stake in his production company. The Top Gear presenter set up Bedder 6 five years ago with the show\u2019s executive producer, Andy Wilman, to exploit the programme\u2019s global brand. Together the pair owned half the firm, while BBC Worldwide owned the other half. But now Clarkson and Wilman have given the BBC full control. Scroll down for video . In the money: Jeremy Clarkson, pictured with fellow Top Gear stars (from left) Richard Hammond, The Stig and James May, has sold his production company to the BBC . It is understood the total deal for both men is worth around \u00a38million. The money will come from the BBC\u2019s commercial division. The production company set up by Jeremy Clarkson and Top Gear executive Andy Wilman, right, was formed for next to nothing in October 2006 and has now made them millions. The pair went to the same prestigious private school in Repton, Derbyshire, where they were two years apart, before working together on various TV projects including Top Gear. Bedder 6 was later bought into by BBC Worldwide in 2007, purchasing half the 10,000 shares and also handing over merchandising and some foreign sales rights to the company. Its last publicly known financial results were released four years ago, where it made a \u00a31.8million post-tax profit and paid out \u00a3700,000 to its shareholders. And now the BBC has bought Clarkson out - making him \u00a35million. There is speculation about where the name Bedder 6 comes from, and it is believed it is a pun on 'better sex' - a reference to an in-joke about one of the dormitories at Wilman and Clarkson's former school. Martin Robinson . Separately, Clarkson is believed to be paid a \u00a3500,000 talent fee by the BBC from the licence fee, which will remain fixed if the show continues until 2015. In addition, Clarkson has signed a new deal with the corporation that will see him present Top Gear for another three years. Bedder 6 has had huge success making money out of Top Gear merchandise, show tours, DVDs and international sales rights. A BBC Worldwide spokesman said: \u2018BBC Worldwide has agreed new commercial . deals with Jeremy, James, Richard and Andy to secure Top Gear\u2019s . international future for another three years. 'This agreement secures the commercial future of Top Gear without using a penny of licence fee money and allows us to continue to grow the brand around the world and return profits to the BBC.\u2019 He caused controversy when it emerged that he earned \u00a33 million in the year to March because of his stake in Bedder 6, as the company made pre-tax profits of \u00a315.2 million and is estimated to be worth more than \u00a350 million. It has had huge success making money out of merchandise, show tours, DVDs and international exploitation of the show. But Clarkson and Wilman, who have been . friends since their schooldays, resigned earlier this month, and BBC . Worldwide now have total ownership of the company. Showstopper: It has also been revealed Clarkson has signed up to present Top Gear for the next three years . Publicly the corporation is saying it cannot say how much the pair have paid for their stakes, but insiders say it is below \u00a310 million. Clarkson will still get a share of Top Gear commercial revenue generated by the show, in return for promoting the show worldwide. His fellow presenters also signed a three-year deal with BBC Worldwide, suggesting that they will continue to work on the show until 2015, and will also receive money from commercial activities, in addition to the talent fee. The money will be paid to them directly rather than through a private company. Clarkson and Wilman\u2019s windfalls because of Top Gear\u2019s success have left many at the BBC uncomfortable as the organisation attempts to make cutbacks. By Martin Robinson . Top Gear's success has a lot to do with Jeremy Clarkson's efforts as a presenter and writer. But there have been plenty of problems along the way, and Clarkson has often been at the centre of the controversy. In November 2008 he decided to make a joke about changing gear in a lorry and how tough a job it is - and linked it to the Suffolk Strangler Stephen Wright - who murdered several sex workers in Ipswich. Complaining Clarkson said (pictured right and video below): 'Change . gear, change gear, change gear, check mirror, murder a prostitute, . change gear, change gear, murder.\u00a0 That\u2019s a lot of effort in a day.' In February 2009, Clarkson famously called then-prime minister Gordon Brown a 'one-eyed Scottish idiot'. A year later he made a joke about a woman in a . burka wearing a red G-string to illustrate dangerous driving conditions, which was branded 'distasteful'. Spin doctor Alastair Campbell revealed on his blog in the same month that in an un-aired comment Clarkson was asked by him about gay rights and he replied 'I demand the right not to be bummed.' In other gaffes he compared a Ferrari to a person with special needs, called Mexicans 'lazy', 'feckless' and 'flatulent', said long queues at airport control could be solved by 'a bit of racism' and was caught parking in a disabled driver bay while filming - receiving large numbers of complaints as a result. Earlier this year he compared a Japanese car to the Elephant Man and people with 'growths on their faces'. But probably his most controversial moment came as he appeared on the One Show, where he said that striking public sector workers 'should be shot in front of their families' (video below).

Saheena Tegally, pictured, has been cleared of trying to let an uninsured driver off following a flirtatious exchange of messages . A policewoman accused of trying to let an uninsured Porsche driver off after they exchanged flirtatious messages has been cleared of perverting the course of justice. WPC Saheena Tegally, 26, swapped numbers with Richard Myerson after she pulled him over for an insurance check, London's Wood Green Crown Court heard. They sent texts and emails to each other, including one in which Mr Myerson suggested the Metropolitan Police officer should sit at her desk in her underwear after she complained about the heat, the jury was told. In another message, the court heard the West Hampstead-based officer told Mr Myerson 'It's really hot. I'm in my bikini catching the sun.' Prosecutors claimed WPC Tegally falsely told other officers that Mr Myerson had been covered when he was stopped because he was flirting with her and asked her out on a date. But she denied perverting the course of justice, telling her trial that the messages the couple swapped were just 'banter' and she never had any intention of meeting him on a date. The jury of eight women and four men unanimously found WPC Tegally not guilty of perverting the course of justice today, less than two hours after they retired to consider their verdicts. Wearing a black blazer, pink top and black skirt, WPC Tegally, of London Colney, Hertfordshire, broke down in tears in the dock and hugged members of her family after leaving the courtroom. Following the verdict, WPC Tegally said: 'I'm just pleased. I just want to go home.' Her mother added: 'She needs to rest, it's been a tough year.' During the trial, WPC Tegally said that at the time of the alleged offence in July last year she had just broken off a relationship, during which she had undergone an abortion. The court heard the officer sent Mr Myerson a text saying 'far too hot to be stuck in uniform', to which he replied 'you could sit behind your desk in your underwear, then people will take bad news much easier'. Saheena Tegally (pictured) of London Colney, Hertfordshire, broke down in tears in the dock after a jury cleared her of perverting the course of justice . She admitted she had been 'flattered' by the attention after the court heard she sent a text to a friend, saying she had 'seized a Porsche off a 25-year-old, he is minted and has asked to take me out'. During cross-examination, Miss Tegally said: 'It was flattering, yes it was. But that doesn't for one minute mean I was going to meet up with him or go for a drink. 'It was never my plan to go with him.' She told the jury she had still been in love with her ex-partner at the time, and still was, so would not have met up with Mr Myerson. Ms Tegally admitted that she helped Mr Myerson receive insurance documents and was sent via email documents showing he had not been insured but claimed she did not read them closely and initially assumed he was covered. She told the court it was just a mistake on her part and that she had never told her superiors definitively that he had been legally driving, only telling them it 'looked like' he was. She also denied a prosecution claim that she deliberately deleted emails relating to the case. Outside London's Wood Green Crown Court, Ms Tegally said: 'I'm just pleased. I just want to go home.' She said she created a proper 'paper trail' but the emails may have been lost after she deleted a large number from her account simultaneously without checking them, following a warning about not having enough space.

I write this as someone who not only thought that the act would be overturned, but also still thinks there are strong constitutional arguments to be made against the mandate. All Americans, however, regardless of their partisan affiliation or views on the Constitution, had something to celebrate Thursday . Despite what almost all the pundits predicted, the court's decision provides some evidence that there remains one institution of American government that cannot be seen as nakedly partisan. In the end, Chief Justice John Roberts, a career Republican who was nominated for the Supreme Court by George W. Bush, cast the deciding vote upholding the signature act of the current Democratic administration. This, I think, is what Americans indicated they were looking for when they elected a president in 2008 who, four years earlier, had risen to national prominence by giving a speech in which he took issue with those who would \"slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states.\" Unfortunately, the divide between Republicans and Democrats has, if anything, gotten worse over the past 3\u00c2\u00bd years. Of course, each side blames the other for this result; they are both right. More blame, however, is not what is needed. We used to refer to Congress, or at least the Senate, as the \"world's greatest deliberative body.\" We all know that very little of what might be termed \"deliberation\" goes on within either chamber nowadays. Instead, Republicans attack Democrats, and Democrats attack Republicans. To deliberate means to consider something carefully. It means you have to listen to and weigh the position of your opponent. Unfortunately, in today's world, partisans have adopted what amounts to a version of political fundamentalism in which giving any credence to the other side's position is a form of heresy. But deliberate is exactly what the Supreme Court does. It is a far from perfect process, and yes, the court is affected by politics. As James Madison reminded us, however, neither the government nor the governed are angels. Perfection is not to be expected. Some attempt, however, to think through issues in a nonprejudicial way is required. Of course, Supreme Court justices have advantages. They do not have to stand for election and, as the chief justice wrote in his opinion read Thursday, they do not have to take a position on whether a law \"embodies sound policies.\" Nevertheless, the court, and particularly the chief justice, offered an important lesson to the political branches on Thursday on how they might undertake to solve the nation's problems. Will those who serve in the political branches listen? Their initial reactions are certainly not encouraging. The president and Congress may, however, want to take a look at current approval polls. Although even their numbers have declined lately, the Supreme Court has a much higher net approval number (+8), than Obama (-4), or the Congress (-62). Hopefully, the court's numbers will be improved after Thursday's decision. Both the Republicans and Democrats will doubtless find fault with Roberts' opinion, but the example of bipartisan deliberation that the court provided was much needed in today's political climate. \"This Honorable Court\" deserves our gratitude.

An experienced construction worker was crushed to death by a tonne of wet concrete while working on a Crossrail building site, an inquest heard today. Slovakian Rene Tkacik was killed in a tunnel below Fisher Street, in Holborn, on March 7 last year, becoming the first fatality on the \u00a315 billion project. Mr Tkacik, of Hackney Road, east London, had been working in the UK to earn money to send home to his family in Slovakia so he could pay for his daughter Esther to go to university, a statement from his wife Renata said. The court heard that Mr Tkacik, 44, 'didn't know what he was supposed to do' on some occasions because of his lack of English. He was  crushed by a tonne of concrete after he went to check the surface of the tunnel - suffering 'devastating injuries incompatible with life'. He  was employed by contractor BFK and had been working on the section of tunnel which had been widened. His mother, widow and three sisters were in court today for the inquest at St Pancras Coroners Court. Speaking to the family Coroner Mary Hassell said: 'I accepted that we will have a lot of detailed discussion about the matters of concrete spraying. 'But I recognise at the heart of all of this is your loved one.' In a statement read in court Mr Tkacik's widow Renata said she last saw her husband five days before his death. She said: 'He studied as a miner and worked as a blaster in a uranium mine. 'When he worked in the mine he was responsible for people's lives. He worked in different countries. 'He moved to Spain and worked there as a cement sprayer and he had huge experience in that. He was well read and taught himself Spanish.' She explained he came to the UK to work on Crossrail as a concrete sprayer to raise money to send his daughter to university. She said: 'To work on Crossrail he had to complete four exams which he passed first time. Not many people were admitted to the project and he did the exams in Spanish . First casualty: The 44-year-old construction worker was\u00a0the first fatality on the \u00a315 billion project (file picture) 'He had difficult living conditions and wasn't able to sleep properly and was constantly tired. His English was rudimentary and he was working with a lot of people speaking English. At times he didn't know what he was supposed to do. She added: 'He would take a dictionary to work and people were rude to him because he didn't understand them. 'He had become so tired and found himself a flat. I came to visit him there and I hardly recognised him, he had got out of his sleep routine and found it hard to get back into it. The 2nd of March was the last time I saw him.' The court also heard how he kept to himself in the evenings and would call his wife instead of meeting up with co-workers as he did not drink and never did drugs. The jury also heard from Metropolitan police detective sergeant Kavin McGrath who showed the jury a digital image of the tunnel where Mr Tkacik had been working when he died. He showed the court where the machine which had been spaying the concrete on to the walls of the tunnel and where the concrete had fallen. He said: 'At the time of the fall, the concrete spraying machine had run out of concrete and was waiting to be refilled. 'It appeared the deceased was in an exclusion area underneath the concrete. He also had a shovel in his hand at the time the concrete fell. Scene of the accident: Mr Tkacik was killed in a tunnel below Fisher Street, in Holborn on March 7 last year . 'It was just under a tonne of concrete that came down, which is the equivalent of a bag of building sand.' The detective added: 'It happened within a second and people further up the tunnel came down to help and they pulled him away from the danger zone and tried to resuscitate him.' An ambulance crew were first called to the scene and then the London Air Ambulance but he was pronounced dead at the scene at 6.14am. Before the start of proceedings campaigners and union members who were part of the Construction Safety Campaign protested outside calling for a full investigation into the health and safety of Crossrail. The coroner heard submissions from the family's legal team for the evidence from two witnesses to be heard, who would have given information about the safety processes at other Crossrail sites. However the request was rejected by the Ms Hassle who said: 'There is a danger this inquest will turn into a review of Crossrail, this inquest cannot do that and this is not a public inquiry to consider Crossrail's operations across London.

Whether it was jealousy or nervousness, this bird of prey's antics almost ruined the big day for a bride and groom. Lilo the Barn owl was supposed to be flying the rings down the aisle for Ceire and Andrew Bode but he decided to head for the rafters and refused to come down. Mr Bode, 32, tried to coax Lilo down with a piece of chicken but he remained on his perch and it was only when his handler produced a dead chick that they managed to get him down. Wedding chaos: Lilo the Barn Owl (pictured) was supposed to fly Cerie and Andrew Bode's rings to the altar - but instead flew into the roof . The couple, who got married in Hoghton, Lancashire, said Lilo\u2019s performance helped calm their nerves and made sure the day was even more memorable. Flown off: Lilo the Barn owl sits on a rafter holding onto the rings and refuses to come down - despite efforts to tempt it with chicken . Ceire, 33, said: 'It was absolutely hilarious. We wanted our wedding to be something different and this made sure it was. 'If we\u2019d just had the owl delivering the rings then our guests would have talked about it for maybe five minutes. 'Because of what happened, people are still talking about it now. It really broke the ice and stopped everyone feeling nervous.' Andrew, who hired Lilo for \u00a3150 from a bird sanctuary, said: 'Ceire is a big Harry Potter fan and she wanted to incorporate this into the wedding day. 'We\u2019ve also been to hundreds of weddings in the past through work so we wanted one with a difference. 'The owl was at the back of the church with one of the people from the sanctuary. 'None of the guests knew we had an owl as ringbearer so it was a surprise for them when, after we\u2019d said our vows, I picked up a glove and a piece of chicken. 'I\u2019d been told to make a clicking sound with my mouth to call the owl over, but it wasn\u2019t coming. 'Eventually it started flying up the aisle, but then it veered off and almost flew in Ceire\u2019s face. Then it just flew up into the beams and stayed up there for about five minutes - only it felt a lot longer. 'But we didn\u2019t know how to get the bird down and the guy from the sanctuary pulled out a dead chick to coax it down. Wedding chaos: The couple, who hired the owl as ringbearer, were relieved when the owl was eventually be tempted down from the rafter . 'It was a bit of a surreal moment really, I didn\u2019t expect to be holding a piece of chicken and trying to lure an owl down from the roof with a dead chick on my wedding day. 'The guests were all really laughing. And it did stop me from feeling so nervous.' Ceire added: 'I didn\u2019t mind at all. It was still the best day of my life. Everything else went to plan, this was just a little hiccup in my perfect day.' The couple, who have been together for seven years, have taken a long weekend to the Lake District for their honeymoon. In September this year another owl held up a wedding after it flew to the roof of a church and fell asleep on a ledge. On that occasion the owl could not be coaxed down and so Sonia Cadman, 46, and Andrew Mettle, 49, had to get married using a back up set of rings. It remained perched high inside the 900 year-old Holy Cross Church in Sherston, Wiltshire, for an hour after falling asleep.

She managed to get up and move to the center of the house. \"Amazing what you can do when you have to,\" she said. The tree's impact left a large, visible crack through her ceiling. Now, days later, Campbell sits on her porch in a wheelchair, surviving record heat with no power and a quickly dwindling supply of food. Her husband managed to get some staples such as bread. \"There was no lunch meat or anything that we found in the stores, but there is always peanut butter,\" she told CNN with a smile. \"We're tough, we'll make it. West Virginians -- we can make it.\" The lack of power and limited food supply have put her in the same boat as millions of others this week. Triple digit strategies for staying healthy . As of Wednesday night, 699,000 customers scattered across 11 states had no electricity, down from about 1.8 million late Monday -- and from a peak of 4 million over the weekend. A household is considered one customer, so the actual number of people without power is higher. Pepco power company, which serves the D.C. metro area, said it expected to restore power by the end of Wednesday to 90% of its customers who lost electricity. West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said about 300,000 customers were without power Wednesday morning. That number appeared to have dropped to 238,000 by evening. Parts of his state as well as South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska were under heat advisory warnings. Excessive heat warnings were in place for portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky. The National Weather Service said those areas would be scorched with temperatures near or above triple digits. As Americans celebrated Independence Day, many in the affected regions are focused on finding ways to get by until power can finally be restored. Eddie Harmon and his family in South Charleston, West Virginia, have spent nights sleeping in a car just to avoid the oppressive heat inside their home. One of his daughters has gone to stay with her grandmother, who has a generator. He walked to visit some neighbors to make sure they're OK, he said in an iReport. Getting around is tough because many gas stations have run out of supplies. People are running out of cash as well and the ATMs have run out, he said. Ironically, a previous power outage paid off, he said. His deep-freeze freezer had 3 inches of solid ice at the bottom because of a power outage two winters ago -- and that helped keep some chicken cold enough to be safe for cooking. \"I actually had cold Corn Flakes last night before I went to bed because I had milk that was still good,\" he said in a YouTube video Tuesday. Tomblin said Wednesday that while food is in short supply, \"we've made a lot of progress\" since the storm. Gadgets to help you survive a power outage . The Democrat praised federal officials for their assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency \"has responded fantastically,\" providing generators and ice within hours of the state's request, he said. Jeanne Campbell was among those who got power back and then lost it again -- meaning more wasted money and more wasted food. And with the large tree that shaded her house now down, she can't spend much time indoors. \"With a tin roof, it's gonna get even hotter now,\" she said. But, she added with a smile, she can deal with the inconveniences. \"I'm not worried.\" David McMann, in Charleston, West Virginia, has paid a price for the storm and lack of power at his home. He raises koi fish and lost three as a result. \"It was hard to watch them die, and stand by knowing I had done all I could do.\" One of the fish \"was 15 years old and had become almost a friend, if that is possible,\" he said in an iReport. \"This has been an expensive storm for us in more ways than one. This was to have been our vacation. Our traveling has been put off, for we do not have any idea when the power will be restored. I am 63 years old and have been through hurricanes in Virginia and Florida. I have never experienced the wrath of nature any stronger than what blew through these mountains on Friday evening.\" While some of the most harrowing tales come from West Virginia, people throughout much of the Northeast have been struggling as well. Mark Cohen sent iReport a video of his destroyed yard and neighborhood in Mays Landing, New Jersey, showing downed trees, smashed cars and damage to his home. \"We would have been better off with a tornado,\" he said. Cohen, his daughter and his girlfriend have been sleeping in the basement to stay cool. Despite damage to his home, Cohen is looking at the bigger picture. \"When you see this around you -- I'm not an emotional guy -- you quickly think, 'Wow this is nothing. It could have been so much worse,' \" he said. \"You think about the people around the country losing their houses and you can't complain. It's inconvenient, but big picture, we're fine.\" The heat-driven storm that started Friday has resulted in at least 22 deaths from Ohio to New Jersey, 13 of them in Virginia. Another three people in North Carolina died in a second round of storms Sunday.

Gambia's president has demanded a United Nations investigation into the 'manmade sinking, capsizing' of boats carrying migrants to Europe, saying 500 citizens of his African country had died in such incidents in the past five years. Migrants have been streaming out of North Africa, mostly lawless Libya, in rickety boats in rising numbers for years. Many head for Italy, a gateway to the European Union. Nearly 3,000 of those migrants have drowned in shipwrecks this year. Earlier this month, some 500 migrants are believed to have died after traffickers rammed their ship off Malta's coast, leaving only nine survivors. At the U.N. General Assembly, Gambian President Yahya Jammeh described these incidents as 'the very dangerous, racist and inhuman behavior of deliberately causing boats carrying black Africans to sink.' 'The U.N. must conduct a full and impartial investigation into this manmade sinking, capsizing of these boats carrying young Africans to Europe,' Jammeh said. 'If these boats are able to cross the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea only to sink on European coasts, we must find out what deadly mysterious force exists on the European Mediterranean coasts that causes boats carrying young Africans to disintegrate and sink upon arrival,' he said. Dozens of civil defense officials, medical staff and police were waiting at dockside to receive the people after the cruise ship had docked. A small group did disembark from the ship to negotiate with authorities, authorities said, but talks broke off with the group returning to the ship. But several adults holding small children were seen leaving the cruise ship, while one man led away by police in handcuffs. The cruise ship had answered a distress signal from a trawler sailing some 50 nautical miles off the Cyprus coast in poor weather conditions, the Cyprus defence ministry said. Salamis Cruise Lines Managing Director Kikis Vasiliou\u00a0said his company received the request from Cypriot Search and Rescue authorities to assist in the rescue operation on Thursday morning while the cruise ship was returning to Cyprus from the Greek islands. But he said the unexpected turn of events is costing his company 'several hundred thousand' euros after the cancellation of a trip by 300 mainly Russian tourists to Haifa, Israel aboard the cruise ship that was scheduled to depart late Thursday. The Cypriot Defense Ministry said the boat had 'most likely' set sail from Syria loaded with 'civilian refugees.' They will remain at a reception center near the capital Nicosia until authorities determine what will happen to them. The Mediterranean has been plagued by shipwrecks in recent months involving migrants trying to reach Europe from Africa and the Middle East. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees says more than 2,500 people have drowned or been reported lost at sea this year trying to cross the Mediterranean. In one of the deadliest wrecks on record, a ship carrying some 500 migrants - including Syrians, Palestinians and Egyptians - was deliberately sunk by traffickers off Malta earlier this month, leaving just 10 known survivors.

Police have seized scissors and knives from the home of a 21-year-old woman charged with dismembering and strangling her newborn son moments after delivering the baby in the bathroom. 'Horrific crime': Lillian Alvarado, 21, has charged with dismembering her newborn son on Thanksgiving last year . Lillian Alvarado has been ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation after she was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and cruelty to children on Thursday, months after police first stumbled upon the shocking crime in northwest Washington. Police were first called to Alvarado's apartment in the 6400 block of 14th Street NW on November 28 after downstairs neighbors complained of bloody water dripping from the ceiling. Authorities said cops arrived at the apartment just before noon on Thanksgiving and that, once Alvarado could be coaxed out of the bathroom, she sat on the bed and said 'forgive me', The Washington Post reported. It was then police found the dead baby, with umbilical cord still attached, lying in an inch of blood and water in the bathtub, with a pair of scissors in the sink. Alvarado\u2019s 70-year-old father, Santiago Alvarado, said family members thought his daughter was taking a shower that morning. He said that she has a history of mental illness and that during episodes, she is unable to communicate. Alvarado came to the United States from El Salvador about a year ago, the father said, fleeing the violence in her native country, where her husband was killed. Scene: Lillian Santiago lived with relatives in the 6400 block of 14th Street NW, Washington. Family members said they believed she was showering on the morning on November 28, when the alleged crime occurred . She made a living cleaning houses in the Washington area and 'worked very hard', he said. Alvarado told her father she didn't know she was pregnant and that the baby was stillborn. However on Thursday the medical examiner said there were air bubbles found in the infant's lungs, meaning that he had died after the birth. The autopsy also found that the newborn\u2019s neck had been compressed, and there were signs of drowning. The cause of death was determined as dismemberment and asphyxiation. Alvarado told police that she knew she was pregnant in April or May, and she believed that by November she was seven months along, according to court documents obtained by The Post. She said she woke up at 6 am on Thanksgiving with a sharp pain and told others in the home that she was sick from something she ate. She later went into the bathroom, where her water broke. According to the charging documents, Alvarado got into the shower, thinking she was about to go to the hospital, and that the baby was born there. The affidavit says she told police she cut the umbilical cord with scissors and did not hear the baby cry. She told police that she remembers hitting her head on the sink as she got out of the tub and flushing the toilet, but then 'everything went dark'. Relatives told police that Alvarado went in and out of the bathroom all morning, once asking for a pair of pants, another time fetching a plunger from a hall closet. 'This was a horrific crime that occurred on Thanksgiving Day to an innocent child killed by his mother,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia Wright said at a D.C. Superior Court hearing, arguing that the suspect is a danger to the community. Santiago Alvarado said his daughter has a history of mental illness. 'She has mental disturbances sometimes, and when that happens, she doesn\u2019t talk,' the father said in Spanish. 'She goes out of her mind. The doctors diagnosed her with a sickness.' He said he did not know the official diagnosis. Lillian Alvarado has a two-year-old daughter who was taken by social workers the same day the baby was born, he said. Santiago Alvarado said that his daughter was hospitalized for about a month after the baby\u2019s death and that he just received a bill for $24,000.

So while Harry, 28, may be a long way . from popping the question himself, his recent behaviour suggests he's . now prepared for Cressida to go from being his casual date to filling . the role of royal girlfriend. Indeed, before his trip to . Afghanistan, friends of privately-educated Cressida had joked that she . was his 'girlfriend-in-waiting'. Given the intense press interest in . royal love lives and the impact Harry has seen it have on the life of . his late mother Princess Diana, and more recently the Duchess of .

Clinton met with Guy Cecil, the outgoing head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, on Wednesday in Washington, according to Politico, and has talked with Robby Mook, a former Clinton aide, about 2016.\u00e2\u20ac\u2039 Both are seen as frontrunner for the top job in a Clinton campaign. Although Clinton's spokesman said he wouldn't confirm or deny the meeting and conversations occurred, Nick Merrill acknowledged that Clinton is talking with a wide array of people about 2016. \"As she decides, she's casting a wide net and wants to hear from a variety of people on a range of specific topics, from policy ideas to what a successful campaign would look like,\"  Merrill said in an email. Democrats have repeatedly said that Clinton has yet to make up her mind, but according to people close to Clinton, there have long been four names in the campaign manager race: Cecil, Mook, Stephanie Schriock and Ace Smith. Here is what you need to know about each. Cecil: . Although Cecil, as executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, was at the helm when Democrats lost the Senate in 2014, he is close with the Clintons -- particularly Bill Clinton -- and worked as Hillary Clinton's national political and field director in 2008. Cecil is an unpretentious figure and has won the trust of many on Capitol Hill. Earlier in his career he led the standard journeyman campaign life, working for campaigns in Arkansas, North Carolina and Colorado (where he led Sen. Michael Bennet's dark-horse win in 2010). Cecil has been hesitant to talk about Clinton publicly as she considers a 2016 run and did not respond to an email for this story. Mook: . The then 33-year-old political operative was seen as a man on the rise when he steered Gov. Terry McAuliffe to victory in Virginia in 2013 and is regularly mentioned by people close to Clinton as a smart choice for campaign manager. Before working for McAuliffe, Mook was the head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and in 2008 steered the Clinton presidential campaign to wins in Nevada, Ohio and Indiana. Mook, who has a loyal following in his own Democratic circle, started his political career working for then Gov. Howard Dean in Vermont. Like Cecil, Mook has been hesitant to comment publicly on Clinton's 2016 bid. He did, however, make the most interesting splash of any of the possible campaign managers when emails he sent to a group of supporters were leaked to ABC. In the emails, which were sent to a group called the \"Mook Mafia,\" the operative urged his supporters to \"smite Republicans mafia-style.\" Schriock: . Schriock currently has what she calls \"one of the very best jobs in American politics right now\" and it wouldn't be a stretch to say Hillary Clinton probably agrees. As head of Emily's List, Schriock's goal is to help elect pro-choice, Democratic women across the country -- something Clinton regularly talks about on the stump. Schriock, the often-on-message campaign veteran, started her career as Dean's 2004 finance director, where she tapped into a new revenue stream -- the internet -- to raise money. She then went on to lead high profile Senate campaigns, including Jon Tester's in Montana and Al Franken's in Minnesota, to wins. Schriock briefed the press at last month's Ready for Hillary strategy session, where she flatly said she was \"not going to talk about\" a possible role in the Clinton campaign. \"I am not going to talk about any conversation I may or may not be having with any candidate who may or may not be running for office,\" she said. Smith: . Smith, a California based consultant with deep ties to the Clinton, would be the dark horse in this field of four. While Smith led Hillary Clinton's campaign to 2008 wins in California, Texas and North Carolina, it is the list of other Democrats he has worked for that is impressive: Richard Daley, Paul Simon, Ann Richards, Dianne Feinstein, Dick Gephardt and Howard Dean, to name a few. People close to Clinton say that Smith would be a good, outside-the-beltway choice for campaign manager. Although he had deep ties to Washington -- through the people he has worked for -- Smith is based in California and has focused on the state in the last few years. And it seems like Smith is interested. \"Anything Hillary Clinton asks me to do, I will do,\" Smith told the San Francisco Chronicle in November. \"I'm a huge charter member of the Hillary Clinton fan club.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hillary Clinton's potential campaign managers are Guy Cecil, Robby Mook, Stephanie Schriock, and Ace Smith.

The Harlequins scrum-half was officially withdrawn from Saturday\u2019s series opener against the All Blacks at Eden Park once it became apparent that he had failed to recover from a shoulder injury in time to play. His removal means that Ben Youngs of Leicester will join forces with Freddie Burns in an untried half-back combination, while Lee Dickson comes on to the bench. It emerged that Care\u2019s injury stemmed from an incident on Monday that initially prompted much amusement among team-mates and management. Asked how the 27-year-old had hurt his shoulder, defence coach Andy Farrell said: \u2018It\u2019s his own fault actually. Tradition: The England team walk onto the pitch during the Captain's Run at Eden Park . Put your back into it: Rob Webber pushes a weights sled . Grappling: The England team warm up during the training session . Pulling: Kyle Eastmond, the England centre, pulls a weights sled during the training session . Hard at work: Tom Johnson pushes a weights sled as England train for the final time . The All Blacks haven\u2019t lost at Eden Park since 1994. They were beaten by France 20 years ago but have since won 31 Tests in a row. \u2018It was a . s**t kick. He actually stubbed his foot on the floor, missed the ball . completely and it was absolutely hilarious. He fell over and hurt his . shoulder. I burst out laughing but then realised it wasn\u2019t too funny. \u2018It . was a little grubber through on the floor, which he mis-kicked. He . won\u2019t be doing it again. I\u2019ve got it on tape. I showed it to all the . lads the next day; it was hilarious. But it wasn\u2019t quite as good two . days later when he wasn\u2019t playing in the Test match. Anyway, we\u2019ll get . over it.\u2019 The . joke lost its appeal very quickly, as the loss of Care is another . grievous blow to English hopes of causing an upset in the opening clash . with the world champions. He was an integral part of the team\u2019s . attacking development during the Six Nations and his vibrant presence . will be sorely missed. Yet, . Farrell suggested the coaches are optimistic that the Yorkshireman will . be available for selection in Dunedin next week. \u2018He was very close,\u2019 he said. \u2018He's a couple of days off and we expect him to be fully fit . for next week, but his strength wasn't quite there. Lookout: Stuart Lancaster runs the rule over his England charges at Eden Park . Faster! Chris Pennell takes a sprint test as England prepare for the All Blacks . Where's the pass? Marland Yarde takes control of the ball during training . \u2018He's . settling down nicely, but the player has to be mentally right that he's . 100 per cent fit. We have good replacements in Ben and Lee. Danny will . rest this one out and start training again on Monday and Tuesday next . week. \u2018He's been in great form, not just throughout the Six Nations when he was outstanding, but he finished the season really well at Harlequins. In general he was in very confident mood coming over here and was looking forward to the tour.\u2019 England have been beset by the absence of so many leading lights for this first Test, due to a pile-up of injuries and fixtures. But the tourists are refusing to be demoralised and accept a grisly fate against Steve Hansen\u2019s experienced, outstanding Kiwi team. Farrell claimed that the visitors will take heart from some rousing performances and results on the road in the last two years. \u2018We\u2019re not frightened of the occasion \u2013 of going to these places and giving it a good crack,\u2019 he said. 'For some of these guys, it\u2019s new to come here, it was new to go to South Africa and for some of them it was new to play in Paris. Everything is new to us but we don\u2019t shirk it. There is always a fighting spirit there.

Their imperious record in their Auckland lair and their dominance of this rivalry over the decades is a grim omen for England, but they are determined to ignore it. \u2018We know we\u2019ve only won twice here,\u2019 said Farrell. \u2018We know we\u2019ve only beaten the All Blacks seven times. \u2018We are aware of the history, but we\u2019re more aware of our own history of late and that\u2019s a side that started two years ago and guys are averaging 20-25 caps. They\u2019ve been through a journey together and we\u2019re seeing the improvements.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\n(CNN) -- Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney addressed the  Republican National Convention on Wednesday. Here is the text of that speech: . Former Gov. Mitt Romney says Sen. John McCain will rein in government spending. Romney: Thank you. Thank you so very much. Ann and I love you all. We have a deep feeling in our hearts for you. We respect you for the values you have and the vision we have for America together. Thank you so much, our dear friends. We sure love you. Thank you. You know, for decades now, the Washington sun has been rising in the east. You see, Washington has been looking to the eastern elites, to the editorial pages of the Times and the Post, and to the broadcasters from the -- from the coast. Yes.  Watch Romney's entire speech \u00bb . If America really wants to change, it's time to look for the sun in the west, because it's about to rise and shine from Arizona and Alaska. Last week, the Democratic convention talked about change. But what do you think? Is Washington now, liberal or conservative? Let me ask you some questions. Is a Supreme Court decision liberal or conservative that awards Guantanamo terrorists with constitutional rights? It's liberal. Is a government liberal or conservative that puts the interests of the teachers union ahead of the needs of our children? It's liberal. Is a Congress liberal or conservative that stops nuclear power plants and off-shore drilling, making us more and more dependent on Middle Eastern tyrants? It's liberal. Is government spending, putting aside inflation, liberal or conservative if it doubles since 1980? It's liberal. We need change all right: change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington. We have a prescription for every American who wants change in Washington: Throw out the big-government liberals and elect John McCain and Sarah Palin. It's the same prescription for a stronger economy. I spent 25 years in the private sector. I've done business in many foreign countries. I know why jobs come and why they go away. And I know that liberals don't have a clue. They think that we have the biggest and strongest economy in the world because of our government. They're wrong. America is strong because of the ingenuity, and entrepreneurship, and hard work of the American people. The American people have always been the source of our nation's strength, and they always will be. We strengthen our people and our economy when we preserve and promote opportunity. Opportunity is what lets hope become reality. Opportunity expands when there's excellence and choice in education, when taxes are lowered, when every citizen has affordable, portable health insurance, and when constitutional freedoms are preserved. Opportunity rises when children are raised in homes and schools that are free from pornography, and promiscuity, and drugs, where there are homes that are blessed with family values and the presence of a mom and a dad. America -- America cannot long lead the family of nations if we fail the family here at home. You see, liberals would replace opportunity with dependency on government largesse. They grow government and raise taxes to put more people on Medicaid, to take work requirements out of welfare, and to grow the ranks of those who pay no taxes at all. Dependency is death to initiative, to risk-taking and opportunity. It's time to stop the spread of government dependency and fight it like the poison it is. You know, it's time for the party of big ideas, not the party of Big Brother. Our economy is under attack. China is acting like Adam Smith on steroids, buying oil from the world's worst and selling nuclear technology. Russia and the oil states are siphoning more than $500 billion a year from us in what could become the greatest transfer of economic wealth in the history of the world. This is no time for timid, liberal, empty gestures. Our economy has slowed down this year, and a lot of people are hurting. What happened? Mortgage money was handed out like candy, and speculators bought homes for free. And when this mortgage mania finally broke, it slammed the economy. And stratospheric gas prices made things even worse. Democrats want to use the slowdown as an excuse to do what their special interests are always begging for: higher taxes, bigger government, and less trade with other nations. It's the same path Europe took a few decades ago. It leads to moribund growth and double-digit unemployment. The right course is the one championed by Ronald Reagan 30 years ago and by John McCain and Sarah Palin today. The right course is to rein in government spending, lower taxes, take a Weedwacker to excessive regulation and mandates, put a stop to tort windfalls, and to stand up to the Tyrannosaurus appetite of government unions. The right course -- the right course is to pursue every source of energy security, from new efficiencies to renewables, from coal to non-CO2 producing nuclear, and for the immediate drilling for more oil off our shores. And I have -- I have one more recommendation for energy conservation: Let's keep Al Gore's private jet on the ground. Last week, last week, did you hear any Democrats talk about the threat from radical, violent jihad? No. You see, Republicans believe that there is good and evil in the world. Ronald Reagan called out the evil empire. George Bush labeled the terror-sponsor states exactly what they are: The axis of evil. And at Saddleback, after Barack Obama dodged and ducked every direct question, John McCain hit the nail on the head: Radical, violent Islam is evil, and he will defeat it. This party... You're hearing it here. You're hearing it here, and they're hearing it across the country. You see, in this party, in this room tonight, and all over America, people in our party prefer straight talk to politically correct talk. Republicans, led by John McCain and Sarah Palin, will fight to preserve the values that have preserved the nation. We'll strengthen our economy and keep us from being held hostage by Putin, Chavez, and Ahmadinejad. And we will never allow America to retreat in the face of evil extremism. Just like you, just like you, there's never been a day when I was not proud to be an American. We -- we Americans inherited the greatest nation in the history of the Earth. It's our burden and our privilege to preserve it, to renew its spirit so that its noble past is prologue to its glorious future. To this we're all dedicated. And I firmly believe, by the providence of the almighty, that we will succeed. President McCain and Vice President Palin will keep America as it has always been: The hope of the Earth.

His name is Moktar Belmoktar, an Algerian who lost an eye while fighting in Afghanistan in his teens and has long been a target of French counter-terrorism forces. Today, he leads a group called Al-Mulathameen Brigade (The Brigade of the Masked Ones), which is associated with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM.)  In the last few years, he has cultivated allies and established cells far and wide across the region. Read more: Power struggle: The North African gas industry targeted by militants . Assault on In Amenas . The gas complex where Belmoktar's followers struck at dawn Wednesday is in a region that has seen plenty of jihadist activity in recent years, in part because of the collapse of government authority across the Libyan border, just 50 kilometers (31 miles) from In Amenas. Counter-terrorism experts differ as to how the attackers - in several pickup trucks - may have reached In Amenas, but there are several roads and tracks across uninhabited desert from Libya. On the other side of the border, a patchwork of militia prevails rather than any government presence. A spokesman for Al-Mulathameen told Mauritanian news websites that the attack was in retaliation for Algeria permitting French overflights as part of the intervention in Mali. But regional analysts believe it was too sophisticated to have been planned in days. Robert Fowler, a former Canadian diplomat who was abducted by Belmoktar's followers in Niger in 2008 -- and met the man himself --  told CNN, \"I suspect they have an intelligence wing and they are constantly looking for ways to grab westerners and embarrass the West and confuse our options. And that's exactly what they are doing.\" Read more: Fallout from Mali battle goes global after militants seize Westerners in Algeria . In a 28-minute video that appeared on jihadist forums last month, Belmoktar warned that Al-Mulathameen would soon act against Western interests in the region. \"This is a promise from us that we will fight you in the midst of your countries and we will attack your interests,\" he said. Announcing the formation of an elite commando unit called \"Those Who Sign With Blood,\" Belmoktar said it would be the shield against the \"invading enemy.\" Wednesday's attack in Algeria was claimed in the name of that unit, which Belmoktar said would include \"the best of our youth and mujahideen, foreign and local supporters.\" Counter-terrorism analysts tell CNN the language suggests this group was dispatched to carry out an act of jihad rather than abduct foreigners for ransom. Watch: Islamist militants attack oil field, two dead . \"This feels much more like attacks staged in the past by other al Qaeda affiliates, rather than another attempt to exchange hostages for ransom, as has often been AQIM's practice,\" said Andrew Lebovich, a long-time observer of AQIM currently in Senegal. \"Belmokhtar likely wants to show he is still engaged in active operations and he is not moving away from the fighting - especially at a time when other Jihadists are in active combat against French troops in Mali,\" he said. But it is also possible that Belmoktar may try to bargain for the release of al Qaeda operatives held in Algerian jails. In his December message, he said, \"To our captive people...it is our promise and our debt as long as we live that we will liberate you, and we sacrifice our lives for you and everything we own to free you.\" Three al Qaeda operatives were detained last July by Algerian security services, but it's not known whether they were close to Belmoktar. Read more: Six reasons events in Mali matter . Marlboro Man . Born in 1972, Belmoktar grew up on the edge of the desert in southern Algeria. He traveled to Afghanistan in 1991 in his late teens to fight its then Communist government. He returned to Algeria as a hardened fighter with a new nickname \"Belaouar\" -- the \"one-eyed\" -- after a battlefield injury, and joined forces with the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) in its brutal campaign against the Algerian regime and civilians deemed to be its supporters. Belmoktar later claimed he met al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden in the Sudan in the mid 1990s. According to Jean-Pierre Filiu, a French scholar who has extensively studied AQIM, Belmoktar rose steadily through the ranks to become the GIA commander for the Sahara. After a popular backlash against the terrorist group in Algeria, Belmoktar switched allegiance to a spin-off group -- the GSPC -- in 2000, and continued to operate in the sub-Saharan region. The GIA was the forerunner of AQIM, which still counts many Algerians in its leadership. Belmoktar remains associated with this fissiparous group -- but is very much his own man. Abdelmalik Drukdal, the overall leader of AQIM, is said to have demoted Belmoktar late last year from his position as 'Emir of the Sahel.' Belmoktar also feuded with a rival commander - Abou Zeid - one of the most violent and radical figures in AQIM. More than most al Qaeda affiliates, AQIM is divided into often competing groups. Citing regional security officials,  Agence France Presse reported Belmoktar had been dismissed for \"continued divisive activities, despite several warnings.\" Libyan sources tell CNN that Belmokhtar spent several months in Libya in 2011, exploring cooperation with local jihadist groups, and securing weapons supplies. One Arab media report - cited in a US Federal Research Division report last year - said Belmoktar had attended an event organized by Wissam ben Hamid, an Islamist commander, in the town of Sirte. There is no way to verify that. More recently, his center of operations was the dusty town of Gao in northern Mali. Another offshoot of AQIM known as the Movement for Unity and Jihad has taken over Gao and introduced Sharia law, including public amputations and floggings. To make money, \"Belmoktar increasingly engaged in smuggling, earning the popular nickname 'Mr. Marlboro' ... he also was involved in the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and illegal immigrants,\" Jean-Pierre Filiu in a 2010 Carnegie Paper. A wide theater . Criminality helped fund jihad. In December 2007, Belmoktar's followers murdered four French tourists in MaurItania.  Two months later, they carried out a drive-by shooting on the Israeli Embassy in Nouakchott, Mauritania's capital. \"We set an ambush to kill the ambassador of the Zionist entity in Mauritania before attacking the compound that housed the embassy and the nightclub that the ambassador was present in minutes before the attack,\" Belmoktar told a Mauritanian journalist in November 2011. Despite US satellite surveillance and the deployment of Algerian and MaurItanian troops to vulnerable areas, al Qaeda affiliates in the Sahel have grown in strength. The vast distances and empty landscapes - as well as a complex relationship with local tribes - play to their advantage. Borders are difficult to seal: the rugged Algerian-Malian frontier is as long as the distance from New York to Chicago. In February 2012, a cache of SAM missiles - looted from Libyan armories - was discovered buried in the desert not far from In Amenas. Andrew Lebovich says the weapons - SA-7 nd SA-24 \"seem to have been at a midway point in the delivery process,\" their destination and customer unknown. Many AQIM figures - Belmoktar and Abou Zeid included - know the region minutely. Indeed, Lebovich says some suspect that it was relatives of Abou Zeid who kidnapped a local Algerian official a year ago - bundling him across the border into Libya. In the view of one Libyan source with close contacts among the region's jihadists, Belmoktar has often been a thorn in the side of AQIM's leadership. \"He was seen as a loose canon, running things in his own way,\" the source told CNN recently. \"and the last thing the leadership wanted was to antagonize the United States just when it was trying to build up strength by stealth, below the radar.\" However the hostage stand-off is resolved, that strategy has now been blown to pieces."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The attack on an Algerian gas installation, claimed by Moktar Belmoktar, may indicate rising Islamist militancy in North Africa.

The social media platforms have agreed to remove reported posts that evade gun laws, restrict minors under the age of 18 from viewing posts about firearm sales and provide education to better inform law-abiding sellers of guns. \"By taking these unprecedented educational and enforcement efforts, we've been able to strike an important balance in helping people express themselves, while promoting a safe and responsible community,\" Monika Bickert, Facebook's head of global policy management, said at a news conference. The new rules come after campaigns by gun safety organizations nationwide have pushed for stricter controls on the sale of firearms. Moms Demand Action, an organization devoted to gun-control reforms, started on a Facebook page in December 2012, shortly after a gunman killed 20 first-graders and six staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. The organization lobbies for more restrictive gun policies that protect the safety of children and families. Moms Demand Action founder Shannon Watts said more than 230,000 Americans signed the group's petition, tweeted or used other social media to ask Facebook and Instagram to crack down on online sales. The organization last year campaigned for Starbucks to ban guns in stores, resulting in an open letter by CEO Howard Schultz telling customers to leave guns at home. Mayors Against Illegal Guns, the largest gun violence prevention group, which was founded by former Mayors Michael Bloomberg of New York and Thomas Menino of Boston, discussed the issue with Facebook officials. \"People are logging onto the Internet and signing into what has become, unfortunately, a virtual gun show,\" John Feinblatt, chairman of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, said in a conference call Wednesday. In November, New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman joined efforts to persuade Facebook and Instagram to issue new gun rules. \"Responsible social media sites know that it is in no one's interest for their sites to become a 21st century black market in dangerous and illegal goods that place our families and communities at risk,\" Schneiderman said in a statement. Facebook already prohibits ads for the sale of guns or ammunition, said Bickert, adding that the new rules will strengthen that policy. Neither Facebook nor Instagram are e-commerce sites, but both facilitate conversation and provide an open marketplace that makes it possible to exchange information promoting weapons sales. Gun sales listed by site users talked about \"no background check required\" or said \"will cross state lines,\" Feinblatt said.

He is shown sleeping in an Oculus Rift headset, in a test run . He will have no previous relationship with the person through whom he will experience the world, but will be aware that \u2018the other\u2019 is a heterosexual male, who is in a relationship. \u2018The other\u2019 person living outside the gallery,  will have to wear a pair of glasses that covertly capture audio and video. This footage will then be watched back by Mr Faird, who will inhabit a space consisting of only a bed, a toilet and shower area, and will be on constant display to the public apart from one hour after he goes to sleep. Mark Faird (pictured) will have no contact with any other real humans during the time of isolation and will eat what \u2018the other\u2019 eats and shower when \u2018the other\u2019 showers, for example .

So far the group of artists behind the project have raised just over \u00a32,000 of their ambitious \u00a3150,000 goal, with 29 days to go. The exhibition seeks to find out whether the artist will lose his sense of self and experience life though another person\u2019s eyes. The end result of the experiment is unknown to everyone, and has the potential for a variety of implications to the artist\u2019s physical and mental health. A psychologist will check on Mark Faird\u2019s health throughout the 28 days and if he is not coping it will be cut short. His physical and mental health will be constantly monitored to ensure his eyesight is not harmed by wearing a virtual reality headset for so long, for example. He is undergoing sessions with a psychologist in preparation for this project so it is possible to assess how the project has affected him."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mark Faird will wear an Oculus Rift for 28 days for the 'Seeing-I' exhibit in a confined gallery.

One of about 30 protesters who had been on hunger strike in an eastern Ukrainian city over pension cuts died on Sunday night after police broke up their tent encampment, emergency services and the protest leader said. The group were survivors of Ukraine's Chernobyl nuclear accident and had been staging their protest in the mining city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine since November 14 after reductions in the state pensions they receive for their part in fighting the 1986 disaster. With temperatures hovering around zero, emergencies ministry workers had provided one large tent with heating for the core protesters to sleep in until the issue had been resolved.

In the ensuing disorder, 70-year-old Gennady Konoplyov was taken ill and died in an ambulance after the police operation, Goncharov said. \u2018The police attack on the tent city was an act of terrorism,\u2019 Goncharov said. The local emergency services said in a statement today the main tent had been taken down swiftly and it was shortly after the police operation had ended that they had been called to give help to Konoplyov.

Richard Roberts, 31, started a blog detailing the one new thing he did every day of the last year - and asked readers to donate a penny for each new thing he did to the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust, after his wife Sian lost their first child. Richard Roberts decided to raise money for the Ectopic Pregnancy Trust after his wife Sian lost their first child. He started a blog detailing the one new thing he did each day of 2012 - here, trying Iranian food . Richard asked readers pf his blog to donate a penny for each new thing he did. Here, being bench-pressed by a friend . After a year of completing tasks from the sublime to the ridiculous - ranging from conducting a philharmonic audience to eating a deep-fried Mars Bar - Richard has raised more than \u00a32,000 for the charity. And yesterday, on the 366th day of his blog, he touchingly announced he had become a dad-to-be, posting a scan of his unborn child. Richard, from Thatcham, Berks, started the blog after kissing his new wife Sian on New Years' Eve 2011 - and realised it was the first time he had kissed his wife in 2012. Down the hatch: Drinking Armadillo milk was another new experience, as was the Man vs Food challenge . He also rescued a piglet and spent a day flying a hawk . He explained on his blog: 'As we drunkenly ushered in the new year in Central London, I grabbed my beautiful wife and gave her a big, lickery kiss! As I did this, I realised I had never brought in the new year by kissing a wife before! 'In my drunken excitement, I informed my pals that I would bravely keep this up for the whole of 2012; trying something new everyday!' After Sian almost lost her life after suffering an ectopic pregnancy, Richard decided to use his resolution to help raise money for the charity which helped them through tough times. He said: 'By the time we got to the hospital Sian had lost so much blood, we were told she was just hours away from death. New acquaintances: Meeting newsreader Jon Snow on a train counted towards Richard's annual tally . The 366 tasks, which ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous, even included a nappy changing contest . After his year of tasks, including trying archery, Richard has raised more than \u00a32,000 for charity . 'I would give anything to have avoided that fateful day. Sadly, that is not possible.' The resulting surgery meant Sian lost one of her fallopian tubes, diminishing the couple's chances of conceiving a baby in the future. Richard's new things ranged from simple deeds - like going to introduce himself to his next-door neighbours, or changing the dirty nappy of a friend's baby. But others were slightly more bizarre - including rescuing an escaped piglet at a children's farm, and chatting to broadcasting legend Jon Snow on the tube. He's also turned his hand to archery, and spent a day handling birds of prey at the Hawk Conservancy Trust. After trying a deep fried Mars Bar, engineer Richard posted: 'I had to have a shower after I finished...and I still felt unclean. Each mouthful took a day of my life.' One particular low point was the deep-friend Mars bar, every mouthful of which Richard described as 'taking a year off my life' Fortunately, his barbequed meat was more palatable . On January 8, he wrote: 'Finally got around to meeting our neighbours properly - Chris, Tracy & Joe. They ROCK!' and posted a photo of him with his new chums. And on May 14th he posted: 'On the train home, Sian and I sat next to the legendary broadcaster, Jon Snow. He had just spent the evening at a charity event at the Royal Albert Hall, in the company of Prince William and Kate. Hmmm. I expect me and Sian were a bit of a disappointment after that! 'Jon Snow was a genuinely lovely fella. I ended up booking him a taxi from Newbury Station - and boring him senseless with this little blog! He seemed startled and confused when I told him that that he was my 'new thing for the day!' But his thousands of followers were touched when on December 31, Richard wrote: 'Became an Expectant Dad!

Yesterday,on the 366th day of his blog, Richard announced he and Sian are expecting again . 'Please remember the reason for me embarking on this bonkers charity project; a few years ago, my wonderful wife, Sian, suffered an ectopic pregnancy. It took the life our wee baby, and it very nearly took my wife's life in the process. The subsequent surgery left my wife bereft on one of her fallopian tubes, thereby diminishing our chances of conceiving in the future. 'Although that fateful incident broke my heart, I was grateful that I still had my wonderful wife by my side! And we never gave up hope!

The first car bomb was outside a busy restaurant; the second was followed by a roadside bomb near an outdoor market in the city, police added. Sadr City is a predominantly Shiite district. At least five Shiite pilgrims were killed when a roadside bomb in Taji, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) north of Baghdad, struck a minibus carrying them to visit Al-Askariya, or the \"Golden Mosque.\" A dozen more were wounded in the blast. Police said most of the casualties were Iranian pilgrims. A roadside bomb exploded in an outdoor market in al-Mamel Shiite neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad, killing five people and wounding 13 others, police officials said. In the Sunni city of Mosul, five people were killed and seven more wounded in four attacks in and around the city, police said. Most of those affected were from the minority Shabak sect. The attacks included two shootings and two explosions targeting houses and shops related to the sect. On Saturday evening, a roadside bomb exploded on a busy road in the al-Jihad neighborhood of western Baghdad, wounding four people. When police arrived to investigate and to evacuate the casualties, another roadside bomb detonated, killing one policeman and wounding two others, police said. In another incident, a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in Muqdadiya, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Baghdad, killing one person and wounding six others, Baquba police said. Britain's ambassador to Iraq, Simon Collis, condemned as \"cowardly\" Saturday's attacks. The top U.N. envoy in Iraq, also condemned the attacks, some of which he said had targeted worshipers. \"This is an atrocious act of violence against innocent worshipers of various faiths,\" said Martin Kobler, the secretary-general's special representative and head of the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq. Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government has blamed the attacks on Sunni insurgents with ties to al Qaeda.

Official figures show more than 80 Britons die from the diseases every day \u2013 70 per cent higher than the European average. Overall, some 138 people in every 100,000 in the UK die from \u2018respiratory diseases\u2019 \u2013 including influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma \u2013 every three years. This works out at 88,000 people \u2013 or 29,000 a year. Britain has the worst record in Europe for deaths from respiratory diseases like flu and pneumonia . Nine out of 10 people who die from flu and other respiratory diseases are over 65, according to the EU report \u2013 suggesting some 26,000 British pensioners die from the preventable diseases every year. The EU said poor public health campaigns warning the elderly to get vaccinated against flu was to blame for countries suffering high death rates. In 2011 the former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley scrapped the annual flu vaccination advertising campaign to encourage pensioners to get the jab. After a spike in deaths the Department of Health u-turned \u2013 reintroducing the yearly campaign. Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK said: \u2018These figures are deeply worrying and shows us just how far there is to go to get care right for older people with poor respiratory health or at high risk from infections such as the flu. \u2018It is vital we ensure the health service is geared up to meet the needs of frail older people and those living with long term conditions and help them stay as well as possible especially as winter approaches.\u2019 Andrew Gwynne, Labour\u2019s Shadow Health Minister, said old age deaths because they could not afford to heat their homes was a national scandal. Poor treatment: Frank Kelly, 79, died of pneumonia three months after nurses left him outside Worcester Royal Hospital wearing just pyjamas in the rain . Heat your home to at least 18C . If heating the whole house is a problem heat the living room during the day and your bedroom just before you go to sleep . Have your flu jab to protect yourself  from influenza . Look out for friends, relatives and neighbours who may be vulnerable to the cold . Watch the weather forecast and plan ahead . Have regular hot meals and drinks . Get financial support to make your home more energy efficient . Have your heating and cooking appliances checked regularly . Wear a few layers of thin clothing rather than one thick layer . When you need to go outside wear shoes with slip resistant, good grip soles . Mr Gwynne said: \u2018Older people living in cold homes is a scandal and we must put an end to it. \u2018Labour's promise to stand up to the energy companies and freeze bills will help to protect older people from poor health.\u2019 Former industrial areas and countries where lots of people smoke are also likely to suffer higher flu and pneumonia death rates. The Brussels report said men were almost twice as likely to die from the diseases. Public Health England confirmed that Britain was the worst record for flu and pneumonia in Europe according to Brussels' official figures. Dr Richard Pebody, head of seasonal flu surveillance at PHE, said: 'Although attempts are made to standardise coding of deaths, it\u2019s important to exercise caution when comparing country to country figures like this, due to systematic differences in the way clinicians complete death certificates. 'While these figures suggest UK has a high rate of respiratory death, it also says UK has one of the lowest rates for circulatory deaths, and it is not possible to conclude from these figures alone that the UK has had a higher burden of disease due to influenza' The Government was attacked earlier this week over official advice for pensioners to protect against the cold this winter. The Public Health England document said struggling pensioners should only turn on the heating in one room to stay warm this winter. The new guidance urges those struggling to pay their heating bills to only warm their living room during the day and their bedroom at night. A hot water bottle should also be taken to bed, according to Public Health England. Other 'top tips' to drive down winter deaths include wearing slippers, keeping out the cold with lots of thin layers of clothes \u2013 and having regular hot meals and cups of tea throughout the day. According to the report the elderly should heat their homes to at least 18C during the winter to protect their health. Last year's cold weather saw 31,100 excess deaths in Britain, mainly among over\u201375s. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) and his Labour opposite number Andy Burnham (right) clashed in the Commons over the NHS today, amid warnings that the health service needs \u00a38billion more funding . Dot Gibson, National Pensioners' Convention general secretary, said: 'Every year, we get the same sort of message from public health officials. But the number of older people dying from cold\u2013related illnesses is on the rise. 'Putting on an extra jumper or walking around a bit more than usual doesn't really address the fact that fuel bills continue to go up way in excess of people's pensions. 'Warm words are nice \u2013 but a warm home is better.' The average household energy bill is now \u00a31,265 a year, \u00a353 more than a year ago. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, added: 'It is shocking that each winter an older person dies every seven minutes from cold weather. 'Turning up the heating is not an option for many older people struggling with high bills.' But Dr Angie Bone, Head of Extreme Events and Health Protection at Public Health England, said thousands of lives could be saved if people followed the Government's advice. The flu jab is available every year on the NHS to protect adults and some children, at risk. Flu can be an unpleasant illness. But for those who are otherwise healthy, it usually clears up on its own within a week. However, for some people the illness can be much more severe, even life-threatening. Those at risk include: . Anyone in a risk group is likely to develop serious complications, such as pneumonia. The flu vaccine is given free of charge to: . The best time to have a flu vaccine is in the autumn, from the beginning of October to early November. For those not deemed at risk, it is possible to pay to have a flu jab. Boots Pharmacies are offering the vaccination in store. Deepa Songara, Boots flu pharmacist said: 'We spend less time outside and much longer closer together at home or in indoor places. 'This 'togetherness' makes it easier to pass germs from one person to another so it is important to think ahead and try to protect yourself before the cold and flu season really kicks in. 'Busy communal places are ideal breeding environments for winter bugs and simple things like washing your hands or using alcohol based hand gel can help keep you well.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The EU report links the UK's high flu and pneumonia death rate to poor public health campaigns and Lansley's 2011 decision to scrap the annual flu vaccination campaign.

More than a quarter of MPs have billed the taxpayer for first-class rail travel in the past year - despite a supposed crackdown on the practice. A study of MPs' expenses yesterday revealed that 185 had claimed for first-class rail tickets rather than travel in standard class. Those involved include Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, Cabinet Office Minister Norman Baker, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and his wife, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. George Osborne in First Class on the train from Wilmslow to London with his aide watching a DVD . The claims were made by 113 Labour MPs, 48 Conservatives, 19 Liberal Democrats, three Scottish National Party and two Plaid Cymru members. Ten members of Ed Miliband\u2019s front-bench team are among the Labour claimants. The findings came as the Government tried to play down embarrassment over Chancellor George Osborne\u2019s decision to travel in a first-class carriage after purchasing a standard ticket on Friday. His office insisted he had always intended to pay for the upgrade and that an aide had sought out the train manager to do so. He is alleged to have found himself in the same situation in May, when he was also caught with a standard ticket in First Class. However, on that occasion he is said to have refused to pay the upgrade and instead 'slummed it' with ordinary travellers in economy class for the rest of the journey between London and his constituency in Tatton, Cheshire. A commuter who was on the train in May told the Sunday Mirror: 'Mr Osborne was confronted in first class by an inspector. The official seemed a bit embarrassed by the whole thing but quite correctly he treated Mr Osborne like anyone else. 'After a short discussion Mr Osborne gathered up his things and moved to a different carriage and slummed it with everyone else. 'I was a bit shocked to see the Chancellor trying to blag a cheap seat. I'd have thought with the money he has that he could afford the ticket.' The Chancellor faced embarrassment after being caught in the First Class carriage with the wrong ticket . After getting off the train George Osborne was confronted by journalists who had seen a string of tweets about the fiasco .

The plants that Monty enjoys most at this time of year are the umbellifers - a family of plants with long stems and flowers forming clusters called umbels . Birds too are attracted in autumn by the seeds, so they instantly enrich the wildlife of your garden. Q When should I trim my box hedge? Doreen Osborn, West Sussex . A Right now! The traditional date was Derby Day, which is at the end of the first week in June. In practice, this is after the risk of frost has safely passed, so depending where you live, any time between the beginning of May and end of June is ideal. This gives time for new growth to harden off before the autumn frosts. Q Half of my 25-year-old Leyland cypress 'Castlewellan' has turned brown. Is this a disease or old age? Jim Henry, Jedburgh, Scottish Borders . A It is not age \u2013 at 25 your plants\u00a0 are babies \u2013 nor is\u00a0 it disease. It is the cypress aphid, which sucks sap from the trees, causing the foliage to die back. The plants can recover and regrow \u2013 but often do not.

Why is this happening? Mrs M Wincott, Lancashire . A This could be petal blight, which is encouraged\u00a0 by excess moisture and poor ventilation. If the petals first develop dark brown veins then this is an indication of blight. Or it could be sunscald caused by the sunlight being magnified by the glass\u00a0 of the porch.

Please include your full name and address. We regret Monty can't reply to letters personally . Many umbellifers add a tall, even stately element to the garden, whether growing in a border or 'wild' at the fringes. Mind you, some are taller than others. My White Garden that I made last year is based upon the spirit of cow parsley (Anthriscus sylvestris), which froths so gloriously along our verges in May. By now it has all but disappeared but there are plenty of good garden plants that capture its free, floating spirit. Ammi majus is perhaps the most exact garden version and it is at its very best right now. It is a biennial that is best sown in September, so it's a good idea to order your seeds now. Keep it over the winter with a bit of protection (a cold frame is ideal) and then plant it out in spring, when it will grow to about 1-1.3m (3-4ft) topped with clean white florets. The only drawback that I have so far discovered is that it can be irresistible to rabbits. Orlaya grandiflora, the white lace flower, is a superb and graceful annual with rather larger flower heads that can be sown either in spring for flowering in late summer or in September for an earlier display the following year.\u00a0 It will flower continuously for about ten weeks so is excellent value in any border. Angelica grows huge on my damp, rich soil. It self-seeds vigorously so needs thinning if it is not to become too invasive, but in its right place it is an absolute joy. No plant is more popular with butterflies, hoverflies, bees and wasps than the lovely, plum-coloured umbellifer Angelica gigas. It starts out slowly, easing itself into summer with modest foliage, but in late July it throws up a 2m (6ft)-tall crimson stem topped with a beautiful bud that opens to reveal umbellifer flowers of the deepest burgundy. You can buy it to plant out now \u2013 it is monocarpic, which means that it dies back once it has set seed, but the seeds will produce a rash of seedlings that can be lifted and moved to wherever you wish to place them, so the plant can live on through its offspring for years. I grow Valeriana officinalis in a pot but it is a spectacular plant nevertheless, which deserves \u2013 and gets from me \u2013 pride of place. The white umbels are touched with pink and carried on tall, upright stems that last for months. The roots are apparently irresistible to cats and rats but the leaves are a sedative for humans. The common fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) exemplifies all the virtues of umbellifers: open, lacy, towering but not shading anything beneath it. The leaves are the perfect accompaniment to baked or barbecued fish and the seeds are delicious too, both rubbed into a joint of pork and to munch on by the handful. Good for the tummy too. Finally, one of my favourite umbellifers is sweet cicely (Myrrhis odorata), which grows in quite deep shade. As with fennel, you can buy it to plant out now, and all of it can be eaten, from root to flower to seed. It tastes of aniseed and is good cooked with tart fruits such as rhubarb or gooseberries because it reduces the acidity."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Monty Don appreciates umbellifers, advises trimming box hedges post-frost, and suggests replacing aphid-affected Leyland cypress 'Castlewellan' with yew.

A university lecturer has apologised to the parents of a 15-year-old girl who died after taking ecstasy tablets he'd left stashed in his home during an unsupervised party. Isobel Jones-Reilly, known as Issy, took two or three pills at the party at a west . London townhouse owned by university lecturer Brian Dodgeon on Easter Saturday in April . 2011. A group of young partygoers found a secret drugs stash - including ecstasy, LSD and ketamine - hidden by the academic, who was a lecturer at the Institute of Education at the time, in a whisky container in a wardrobe cupboard in his bedroom. Mr Dodgeon today broke down in tears as he apologised to the parents of Isobel for leaving the drugs in the house - claiming he didn't believe he was being irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised as there was a '0.1 per cent' chance of his illegal narcotics being found. Tragedy: Isobel Reilly, 15, pictured left, died in April 2011 after taking ecstasy at an unsupervised party in the home of Brian Dodgeon, pictured right leaving the hearing, and Angela Hadjipateras . Cleared: Brian Dodgeon, pictured with partner Angela Hadjipateras, was given an eight month suspended sentence for drug possession after Isabel's death. The couple have been told they will not be charged with gross negligence or manslaughter . At an inquest into her death, he turned to Isobel's parents in the front row and said: 'I am so sorry about what happened. 'All I can say was at the time I didn't feel as though it was irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised.' His voice cracked and he wiped away a . tear as he added: 'In retrospect, I very much regret I had drugs at all . and I made that decision.' But Dodgeon refused to accept it was . 'blindingly obvious' he should not have left his house unsupervised to . attend another party in Hastings with his partner Angela Hadjipateras that night. He said: 'At the time, it didn't seem . likely that anybody would come into our bedroom and start . systematically looking through the drawers. 'There was a 0.1 per cent chance of . anyone finding those drugs, there is also a 0.1 per cent chance that . someone might turn the cooker on and some kind of gas malfunction causes . a fire and people die.' Death: The Kensington home of lecturer Brian Dodgeon where he kept drugs but insisted they would be 'virtually impossible' for the teenagers to find . Addressing Mr Dodgeon, Westminster Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox . said: 'Isn't it blindingly obvious 14 to 15-year-olds are very likely . to take the opportunity to misbehave and to really push the boundaries, . and you should not have left them unsupervised.' Dodgeon said the teenagers usually . invited to his home for parties did not appear to be big drinkers, and . the idea they were look for his drug stash never occurred to him. 'I had never had the experience of our bedroom being used by anyone but Angela and myself', he said. 'At none of the other parties had . anyone gone into our bedroom, even a party that was unsupervised until . 3am - it was a no go area.' He added: 'I didn't think that people . would go through our drawers in our bedroom, I didn't think anyone . would go into our bedroom at all. 'You would have to go through 15 drawers before exhausting all the convenient drawers to look through.' The inquest has heard at previous . parties at his home, a teenage girl had to be put to bed for being too . drunk and there had been cannabis smoking. But Mr Dodgeon said: 'There had never . been evidence of drug taking and never serious problems with people . getting drunk and being sick, or having to be driven home. 'It seemed to me from parties that we had supervised, people would sneak in very small beers or cider.' The lecturer said the teenagers . appeared to be 'polite and studious', adding: 'At that time, I felt that . party was going to be safe. 'I felt it was important to occasionally demonstrate a degree of trust to that generation of kids, I felt it would show trust. 'I really did not think that people would search the bedroom.' Untimely death: Flowers and candles were left in tribute to the schoolgirl near her home after she died from taking up to three ecstasy tablets . Mr Dodgeon previously admitted four counts of . drugs possession when he appeared in court after Issy\u2019s death and was . sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years in December . 2011. The  lecturer . was today told at the hearing . he would not be charged with gross negligence or manslaughter over the . pills being 'readily accessible'. Dr Wilcox said: 'It has been decided there are no further prosecutions that can be brought.' Dodgeon's partner Angela Hadjipateras told the inquest she believed his drug stash was 'virtually impossible' for the . partying teenagers to find. Ms Hadjipateras admitted she knew her . partner of 27 years was a recreational drug user, but she did not want . to know where they were hidden in the house. She . told the inquest Dodgeon regularly smoked marijuana or hash cannabis, . and was aware he had taken LSD and ecstasy in the past. Dudgeon only confessed where his drug . stash was hidden, inside a whisky bottle in the bedroom closet, when . they drove back from Hastings following Isobel's death. 'I knew he had hash and marijuana, . and that that had, I can't remember dates, but I know I had asked him if . he had any ecstasy or other drugs', she said. Mourning: Friends and family release balloons in memory of the schoolgirl whose temperature soared to 41.7C after taking the drugs . 'If he had anything in his possession, he said I wouldn't have to worry about it, they would be very well concealed.' Ms Hadjipateras said Dodgeon moved . his whisky tin of drugs to different places round the house, often . picking hiding places which were 'high up'. She said she had 'deduced' he would . have drugs in the house because she knew he used them, but added: 'I . chose not to find out where it was.' She told the inquest: 'On the way home from Hastings, he told me. He told me that there were drugs hidden in the top cupboard. 'It was in the early stages, before . we knew what had happened, and he said it was virtually impossible it . could have been drugs in the house that would have been the ones. 'He said we couldn't have any problems with any of the kids finding them. 'He told me he had them right at the back of the cupboard, they were in our bedroom in the top cupboard. 'He told me that there was LSD ecstasy, and that there was a very small amount of ketamine.' Asked . by the coroner why she had not tried to find the drugs, Ms Hadjipateras . said: 'I believed that Brian is extremely responsible, and that if he . told me they were extremely well hidden, I preferred not to know.' Ms . Hadjipateras admitted 'eight or nine' teenage parties had been held at . their home prior to Isobel's death, although this was the first to be . unsupervised. Hearing: An inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court in London heard that the schoolgirl would 'probably' have survived if she had received medical attention when she first started to feel unwell . She had . been forced to help a drunk teenage girl at a previous party, and . accepted it was 'not totally outrageous' that drug taking, drinking, and . underage sex could take place at a party. 'Isn't that why you would generally supervise the parties, because of the risk that something can go wrong?', asked Dr Wilcox. 'Surely . it is absolutely barn door obvious the risk of alcohol, cannabis, and . teenage behaviour is more likely to go up if the party is unsupervised.' Ms Hadjipateras said she had asked a neighbour to be 'on call' during the party in case of emergency. She . added: 'When I weighed up whether it was wise or unwise to go and leave . the kids at the party, I heard the views of a number of people whose . children are the same age, I came to the conclusion it was a manageable . risk.' Shortly after taking the drugs, Issy began hallucinating and frothing at the mouth, the hearing was told. But her friends only called an ambulance when . she collapsed and started shaking - about an hour after she took the . pills. When paramedics arrived at the house . in leafy Kensington, west London, her temperature had soared to 41.7C - . compared to the normal body temperature of 37C, Westminster Coroner's . Court heard. Issy was taken to St Mary's Hospital, but she died later that morning. Professor Robin Braithwaite, a . forensic toxicology expert based at King's College in London, said Issy . could have survived if she had been taken to hospital before her . temperature had risen so dangerously out of control after she took the . drugs. He said: 'That is a very high . temperature. The start of irreversible death is something like 42C, a . temperature of 41C is very high. 'It may have been possible that she . would have survived had help been summoned earlier when her temperature . was not quite so high and she was unwell. 'There are cases reported where hyperthermia can be treated. 'The earlier help is sought, before . the temperature rose to those high levels, it may have been possible had . she been admitted to hospital that treatment could have been given to . try and lower her temperature.' He said even with a temperature of 40C or 41C it is 'possible' she could have survived. The 15 year-old suffered from . suspected hyperthermia, brought on by taking two to three ecstasy . tablets which were of 'high' purity, the inquest heard. Cause of death was given as ingestion of MDMA - the active ingredient in Ecstasy. Two other teenagers, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, also took pills at the party and were taken to hospital.

Let's make sure this type of tragedy never happens again. And how do we know that was really Beyonce? Maybe it was a hologram or a body double!\" The above are just the (slightly) exaggerated responses of some in the cybersphere to the revelation that Beyonce Knowles might have lip-synced all or part of the national anthem at Monday's presidential inauguration. There are simply too many people in this country who go from zero to (faux) outrage in a matter of nanoseconds. Just look at Twitter and you will see the overuse of capital letters by people who feel CHEATED and ROBBED by the possibility of Beyonce's prerecorded performance. The U.S. Marine Band, which provided the musical accompaniment for Beyonce, is neither confirming nor denying that she lip-synced to a prerecorded track, although earlier a spokeswoman said the pop star \"did not actually sing.\" The Marine Band did explain that Beyonce, like all singers at the inauguration, made a recording of the song she was scheduled to sing which would be played \"in case of freezing temperatures, equipment failure or extenuating circumstances.\" To be honest, if Beyonce did lip sync the entire song she should be nominated for an Emmy award for outstanding acting in a TV Special, because it looked amazingly real. And I worked at \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2004 when Ashlee Simpson had her infamous lip-syncing meltdown so I have seen up close the horrors of bad lip-syncing. It's not that I'm unsympathetic to those who wanted to experience Beyonce singing live. There's truly no substitute for live performances. (Although on nights when I'm tired, I wish I could lip-sync some of my jokes to a prerecorded track, but alas, that's not allowed in my field -- yet.) And true, Kelly Clarkson sang a great version of \"My Country 'Tis of Thee\" live at the inauguration. However, to those outraged by the thought of Beyonce's possible lip-syncing, you need to keep a few things in mind. First, there's no dispute that was Beyonce's voice we heard. This isn't a Milli Vanilli type scandal where a singer lip-synced to songs actually sung by others. Secondly, performing to prerecorded tracks has been done at previous presidential inaugurals as well as at other big outdoor events because of audio concerns posed by weather conditions or technical issues. Indeed, at President Obama's 2009 inauguration, music legend Yo-Yo Ma mimicked playing his cello to a prerecorded track because the frigid weather would have made it too difficult to play live in tune. And at the 2012 Olympic games in London, the majority of musical performances in the opening and closing ceremonies were performed to prerecorded tracks, including ones by iconic bands like The Who and the Rolling Stones, because of acoustic issues with the outdoor venue. (Audience members were told well in advance that some songs would not be performed live.) Obviously, this is not an uncommon practice in special situations. Plus, this is clearly different than if people had paid to see Beyonce in concert and she lip-synced most, if not all, of her songs. That would have been wrong, just as it was when Britney Spears did it during her 2009 tour. In fact, Britney's overuse of lip-syncing so angered people in Australia that lawmakers there actually considered passing a law requiring that concertgoers be informed if parts of a show will be lip-synced. Beyonce hasn't responded about whether she did lip-sync. If she did, it could have been for a very valid reason, such as concerns about the weather or acoustics, or maybe nerves -- even superstars must get a little nervous when they see a crowd of close to a million people. Unfortunately for Beyonce, this issue will not go away quickly, because she's scheduled to perform in less than two weeks during the Super Bowl halftime show. There's no doubt reporters will hound her regarding whether she will be singing live or not. But to me, the real question people should be asking is: Who is going to win the Super Bowl? The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Beyonce's suspected lip-syncing at the inauguration caused online outrage. The U.S. Marine Band didn't confirm or deny the claim, but noted that all singers record a backup track for emergencies. It was Beyonce's voice, not a Milli Vanilli scandal.

Beyonce, who's set to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show, convincingly lip-synced, unlike Britney Spears' 2009 tour."}]}

While euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the UK, other countries, like Switzerland, do permit assisted suicide in specific circumstances - and Dignitas is one of the few to accept foreigners. Scroll down for video . Research: A new study found a doubling of the number of people of all nationalities travelling to Dignitas, an organisation founded in 1998 to help people with terminal and incurable illnesses end their own lives . Academics from Zurich University behind the study argue that other countries have changed the law, or at least had a serious debate about the issues, as a result of the rise in suicide tourism. However, British experts claim there has been little impact in the UK despite increasing numbers seeking help to die abroad. The Zurich Institute of Legal Medicine produced data on 611 cases of assisted suicide of non-Swiss people from 31 countries around the world during the five year period. The highest number was 268 Germans followed by 126 Britons \u2013 making two thirds of the total. The study, published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, found in 2008 there were 123 cases of suicide tourism. This dipped to 86 cases in 2009 and increased steadily to 2012 when it reached 172 cases. Overall, 58.5 per cent of cases were women and the average age of those using these services was 69 - although the range was from 23 years to 97. There are six \u2018right to die\u2019 organisations operating in Switzerland offering assisted suicide to their members providing they meet certain criteria. Law: While euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the UK, other countries, like Switzerland, do permit assisted suicide in specific circumstances - and Dignitas is one of the few to accept foreigners (file photo) Four of these bodies offer services to foreign nationals, including people from the UK. These organisations deal with around 600 cases of suicide each year, some 150 to 200 of which are suicide tourists, the researchers found. Most cases of suicide tourism used Dignitas which charges between 9,000 to 10,500 Swiss francs (about \u00a36,000 to \u00a37,000) for assisting suicide, says the study. Neurological diseases including paralysis, motor neurone disease, Parkinson\u2019s, and multiple sclerosis were the most common reasons for assisted suicide - accounting for almost half of cases. Dr Charles Foster, of Green Templeton College at Oxford University, in a commentary in the journal, said there may be growing public acknowledgement of something \u2018intellectually, if not morally uncomfortable, about getting another country to do your dirty work\u2019. But, he said, this was not a reason for changing English law on assisted suicide. In the House of Lords, when he presented the Assisted Dying Bill, Lord Falconer said \u2018The current situation leaves the rich able to go to Switzerland, the majority reliant on amateur assistance, the compassionate treated like criminals. \u2018It is time for a change in the law but only a very limited and safeguarded change. \u2018It would not lead to more death but to less suffering.\u2019 The second reading of the Bill, which would offer the chance of assisted dying to terminally ill patients deemed mentally capable and within six months of likely death, took place in July and is to be moved to the next Parliamentary stage - the committee stage - at a date yet to be set.

Bush defended his administration's handling of the war in Afghanistan on Sunday, telling CNN that some NATO allies who contributed troops to the conflict \"turned out not to be willing to fight.\" In an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley, Bush strongly refuted criticism that his administration took its \"eye off the ball\" in Afghanistan when he ordered troops to invade Iraq. He said he ordered American forces to overthrow Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein with the assumption that allied forces would help make up the difference in Afghanistan. \"What happened in Afghanistan was that our NATO allies, some of them, turned out not to be willing to fight,\" Bush said. \"Therefore, our assumption that we had ample troops -- U.S. and NATO troops -- turned out to be a not-true assumption. So we adjusted.\" The former president didn't name any countries specifically from NATO, which includes 28 nations in Europe and North America. Some 785 military personnel from NATO countries besides the United States have been killed in Afghanistan since hostilities began in October 2001, with the United Kingdom, Canada and France having the most fatalities. The comments by the 43rd U.S. president, along with those of his brother and former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, aired during a CNN special, \"Bush: Two Years Later.\" The former president addressed a host of matters in the interview, which came days after the release of his 481-page memoir, \"Decision Points,\" and two days ahead of the groundbreaking for his presidential library and museum on Southern Methodist University's campus in Dallas, Texas. Bush said he \"felt terrible\" that weapons of mass destruction were never found in Iraq, despite the administration's persistent and insistent case that Saddam Hussein had them before the invasion. But while he took responsibility for the big push on and subsequent lack of WMDs, the former president said he still thought the Iraq war was justified. \"If (Saddam Hussein) was in power today, the world would be a lot worse off,\" he said. \"I believe that a free Iraq will be transformative in the Middle East.\" Bush said he had no regrets, too, about his decision near the end of his second term to push the 2008 federal bailout that loaned hundreds of billions of dollars to companies including AIG, Citigroup, Bank of America and General Motors. President Barack Obama later successfully pressed to use billions more in federal funds to buttress the U.S. economy, as it struggled through what's been called \"The Great Recession\" marked by high unemployment and rounds of foreclosures in a percolating real estate crisis. \"I set aside my free market principles and made a very difficult decision,\" Bush said. \"I believe that those decisions ... did prevent the economy from heading into a depression.\" Bush said he was dismayed when his administration's efforts to efforts to change the Social Security system -- an effort to control its costs -- failed to bear fruit. In late 2004 and early 2005, his administration laid out proposals to overhaul Social Security, in part by creating individual investment accounts that would act more like a traditional 401k and replace the current collective Social Security pool. But the plan floundered under pressure from Democrats and special interest groups such as the AARP, and Congress never even saw any formal legislation, much less voted on it. \"Not reforming Social Security was a huge disappointment,\" Bush said. Jeb Bush joined his brother for part of the CNN interview, saying he never publicly disagreed with George W. Bush when he was president and is \"not going to start now.\" Alluding to the hyperpartisanship in Washington, the former Florida governor said there's still room for civility in politics. \"I don't think you can be against everything, just because someone has a D (for Democrat) by their name and you have an R (for Republican) by your name,\" Jeb Bush said. George W. Bush said that he was mindful not to get involved in \"name calling\" as president, adding that he wasn't bothered when he was targeted. Bush said, too, that he didn't support Republicans challenging Democrats' patriotism just because they disagreed with them. \"I don't remember doing that personally, and that was uncalled for if that was the case,\" he said. \"Patriotic people disagreed with my decisions.\" One Democrat he has no qualms with is his Oval Office predecessor, Bill Clinton. Bush said he \"genuinely liked\" Clinton, whom he called one of his \"buddies,\" in part because he's been so \"gracious\" to his father, George H.W. Bush. iReporter: Welcome back, President Bush . The Bush brothers both said Republicans' setbacks in recent election among Latinos -- which voted Democrat by a 2-to-1 margin -- should be a top concern for the party, with George W. Bush calling the situation \"un problemo.\" \"Part of it relates to tone,\" said Jeb Bush, saying some Latinos turned away from the Republican party when some of its members spoke strongly on illegal immigration. \"If they don't feel welcome, they're not going to listen to the message.\" Jeb Bush reiterated that he would not run for president -- like his brother and father -- in 2012. The former governor also said he did not want to head the national Republican party because he wanted to achieve \"some financial independence\" for himself and his family. The current GOP party chief, Michael Steele, has faced persistent criticism from Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, and others in recent months, even though Republicans scored big wins in the recent mid-term elections. As to speculation about Steele's future as the party's head, Jeb Bush opted not to wade into the party leadership debate, saying he was \"Switzerland in relation to national Republican politics.\" \"If I'm trying to achieve financial security for my family and I'm not running for office,\" Jeb Bush said. \"I certainly wouldn't run for RNC chairman.\" Jeb Bush said that he could see either or both of his sons, Jeb and George, following their father, their uncle, their grandfather and their great-grandfather (former Sen. Prescott Bush of Connecticut) by running for political office. But George W. Bush said he didn't see his daughters, twins Jenna and Barbara, who turn 29 this month, going into politics. \"They will be involved in helping improve people's lives,\" Bush said. \"But I doubt they'll ever run for public office.\" As to his own future, and legacy, Bush said he was content to let his memoir and his decisions speak for themselves. \"I'm not trying to shape my legacy,\" he said. \"I'm trying to provide data points for future historians.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Bush defended his administration's handling of the Afghanistan war, the Iraq invasion, the 2008 federal bailout, and expressed disappointment over failed Social Security reform.

Just 24 hours after it was reported that Kim had ordered the machine-gun execution of his former singer lover, Hyon Song-wol and 12 other entertainers, it was claimed today that hawkish army chief Kim Kyok-sik, 75, had been removed from his post, his future unknown. North Korean watchers in the hated South Korea said the sacking appeared to be an attempt by Kim, whose age is estimated to be about 30, to bring unruly and ageing military leaders to heel. General Kim Kyok Sik, right, stands with former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Although close to Jong Un, he has been removed from his post . But his ruthlessness appears to be paying off in his own country - according to researchers at Seoul University, the dictator now has a higher approval rating then both U.S President Barack Obama and UK Prime Minister David Cameron. Seoul-based North Korean analyst Daniel Pinkston, said yesterday that Kim had learned that he had to manage his dictatorship carefully if he wanted to stay in power. 'He is replacing officers appointed by his father, Kim Jong-il, with younger men who he hopes will now shore up his political power base.' Kim Kyok-sik does not go without leaving an impressive record of aggression behind - he is credited with masterminding the torpedo sinking of the South Korean Navy ship, Cheonan, and the shelling of the south's Yeonpyeong Island, both incidents occurring in 2010. Analysts said there was little doubt that Kim had been removed after studying a report in a North Korean newspaper, the official Rodong Sinmun daily. A source in the South Korean government said: 'We're closely watching development in the North, believing that Kim Kyok-sik has been replaced by Ri Yong-gil, the Army's General Staff chief of operations.' Execution: Kim Jong-Un, pictured with his wife Ri Sol-ju (left), also had Hyon Song-wol and 12 other entertainers killed . The official said the North Korean paper had mentioned Ri Yong-gil behind senior regime figures Choe Ryong-hae and Jang Song-taek in a report about Kim watching a soccer match alongside selected soldiers. It mentioned Ri before Jang Jong-nam, the minister of the People's Armed Forces, but significantly there was no mention at all of Kim Kyok-sik, who was always photographed at Kim's side. In addition, Ri was seen with a four-star insignia rather than the three stars he displayed earlier, denoting his less senior post. 'Ri seems to have been promoted to chief of the Army's General Staff, because the chief of operations is never mentioned ahead of the Armed Forces minister,' said the source, quoted in Seoul's authoritative Chosn Ilbo newspaper, which revealed the alleged execution of Kim's former lover. Popular: Kim Jong-un, seen applauding during the final of the Torch Cup soccer tournament in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency, has higher approval ratings than U.S President Barack Obama . According to the paper, Kim Kyok-sik's dismissal might have been discussed at a meeting of the Workers Party's Central Military Commission - chaired by none other than Kim Jong-un - last weekend. North Korean media reported that the meeting discussed 'organisational matters' and noted that the leader made an 'important decision.' The leader's ruthlessness has become apparent once again, because he held Kim Kyok-sik in high esteem - yet still felt the need to remove him. Analysts said it was possible that Kim Jong-un hopes the removal of the general might improve relations with South Korea and China - despite Beijing already being an ally. In spite of his ruthlessness, Kim is still supported by the majority of his people, according to research by the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at Seoul National University. Although not strictly accurate as they polled 133 North Korean defectors, researchers found that 61.7 per cent of those asked thought that the dictator had the backing of the majority of his country. According to the Telegraph, the result not only makes him\u00a0 more popular than his predecessor and late father, but also U.S President barack Obama who has a 41 per cent approval rating and UK Prime Minister David Cameron who is languishing on 38 per cent."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Kim Jong-un's ruthless rule, marked by the execution of his former lover and 12 entertainers, and the replacement of aggressive army chief Kim Kyok-sik with Ri Yong-gil, is surprisingly popular.

Jerome Boatang, Mats Hummels and Sami Khedira will sit out their country\u2019s clash with Argentina in Dusseldorf on Wednesday evening \u2013 although only the latter remains a doubt for the Euro 2016 curtain-raiser with Scotland in Dortmund on Sunday. Just 52 days after watching Philipp Lahm lift the game\u2019s biggest prize in Rio, Low is deeply concerned that a lack of proper rest for his star performers coupled with the demands of elite club football will adversely affect their chances of a smooth qualification passage. And Low \u2013 who has named Bastian Schweinsteiger as his long-term skipper despite the Bayern Munich man also being currently sidelined \u2013 intends to counter the burn-out issue throughout the qualifiers by drip-feeding uncapped players into his squad.

Management: Low intends to blood uncapped players throughout Euro qualifying to restrict their workloads . \u2018It\u2019s exciting that the Bundesliga has just begun but it\u2019s clear there is a World Cup aftermath \u2013 the effect of playing lots of games in such a short period of time,\u2019 he said. \u2018Many players need more rest. Many have approached the season with knocks and problems that they probably inherited from the World Cup. \u2018That will be a factor in the next few weeks and months. \u2018It will be difficult for me and the Bundesliga coaches to bring all the players in their squads up to the same level. \u2018We respect the qualifying system. But we have many young players trying to get into the squad, like Erik Durm (of Dortmund). \u2018We have to give these players an opportunity when the established ones are ruled out for whatever reason. \u2018So we definitely need this qualifying process to take the up and coming players by the hand \u2013 and allow them to be blooded for the highest level. \u2018Look at Toni Kroos, for example. We might need to leave him out if he\u2019s irreplaceable for Real Madrid. I have to accept that because sometimes World Cup tournaments can affect players\u2019 stamina and physical condition. \u2018It\u2019s difficult for them to have just three weeks\u2019 holiday and then go into pre-season training. They\u2019ve been thrown into the deep end again very quickly. Out of action: Sami Khedira (left) and Mats Hummels (right) are among Germany stars out of action this week . \u2018So it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll fall into a \u201cperformance hole\u201d and suffer a little crisis. That\u2019s when other players have to step up to the mark. \u2018For the established players, it\u2019s been very hard for them to get back to normal in the Bundesliga so I need potential candidates in my squad to fill their positions.\u2019 Low\u2019s immediate thoughts are with a rematch against the nation they defeated in Rio to lift their fourth world title. But, with the more meaningful game against Gordon Strachan\u2019s side lying around the corner, he admitted the Scots would not have been the team of choice to face in the first competitive game since the triumph in Brazil. \u2018Scotland is the kind of team Germany have always struggled against,\u2019 he added. \u2018With Scotland\u2019s sheer commitment and their running \u2013 they are a team who never give up no matter what the score is \u2013 then they are difficult opponents. Tight unit: Low and his now captain Bastian Schweinsteiger will lead the next wave of Germany players . \u2018Their fans get right behind them and drive them on. \u2018If you look at this group and the likes of Scotland and Ireland, they come across as similar teams. \u2018They have similar playing styles, who excel for their passion and the physicality of their football. \u2018We know this group is anything but easy because all the teams will try as hard as they can to make life difficult for us. \u2018The likes of Scotland have not been at the last few tournaments so they will give their all to be at the next European Championships.\u2019 While the focus must now be on the Euros, Low feels drawing a psychological line under what went on in South America may prove easier said than done. \u2018It\u2019s nothing that comes automatically and it\u2019s almost impossible to tell players to forget the World Cup,\u2019 he conceded. Last time out: Now-retired captain Philipp Lahm holds the World Cup trophy aloft in Rio de Janeiro . \u2018It\u2019s difficult for players to motivate themselves and be fully aware of the situation. \u2018It won\u2019t be easy but we want to win the game on Sunday. \u2018Despite the fact we have some players missing we still have enough quality to beat opponents such as Scotland. \u2018But, that said, it won\u2019t be easy over the next few months. \u2018We won\u2019t have players playing at the same level because some will have personal ups and downs, physical difficulties. \u2018Their bodies will demand a longer period of rest, so things will be different in the months ahead. \u2018The players will be robbed of physical strength because of the World Cup.

The militant, who has not been identified, reportedly said fighters blasted the Boeing 777 out of the sky - killing all 298 people on board - after mistaking it for a\u00a0Ukrainian government cargo plane. He said the rebels only realised their mistake when they began searching the crash site for the parachutes of military crew who may have bailed out the aircraft, only to find the bodies of children. Scroll down for videos . [caption] . The rebel - who worked locally as a miner before joining pro-Russian separatists - told a reporter for Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera that officers initially told him MH17 was a government plane. 'We shot down a Kiev plane, our superiors told us. We thought we were looking for baled-out Ukrainian pilots but instead we found dead civilians,' he was quoted as saying. 'All those poor people with baggage that certainly wasn\u2019t military... I was looking for a parachute and found the body of a little girl,' he added. His sensational admission that rebel forces shot down MH17 is in stark contrast to other pro-Russian forces in the area, who remain insistent that the plane was taken down by government troops. This morning Alexander Borodai, prime minister of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic, described evidence suggesting rebels had possession of a BUK missile launcher as 'fake'. A pro-Russian militant holds up a stuffed animal as others look on at the site of the MH17 crash. 298 people were killed when the plane was apparently blasted out the sky by a surface to air missile . Gun wielding: Pro-Russian rebels, followed by international observers, walk by plane wreckage as they arrive for a media briefing at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 this week . The 31-year-old fighter, who said he . could not be named in the article but was happy to pose for photographs, . is understood to be from the Oplot combat unit, which was operating in . the area around the Hrabove crash site at the time MH17 was shot down. The newspaper claims they spoke to him at Torez railway station on Tuesday, where he posed for photographs standing alongside one of the refrigerated train carriages containing the bodies of 200 MH17 victims. Ten of his rebel colleagues are said to have stood guard while he spoke. Just hours later these bodies were transported to Khirkiv airport, from where 40 of them were yesterday flown back to Eindhoven in the Netherlands to begin the process of identification - something that is expected to take several months. The wife of a South African helicopter pilot killed in the MH17 disaster has been forced to cancel his credit cards because they have been used since the plane went down in Ukraine last week. Reine Dalziel's husband Cameron, a South African with a British passport who recently moved his family of four to Malaysia, was on board the Malaysia Airlines jet when it was struck by a missile fired by pro-Russian rebels. As it emerged that heartless rebels are using victims' credit cards, answering their phones at the crash site and stealing their belongings - including sentimental items such as jewellery - Ms Dalziel's brother Shane Hattingh told CNN his sister was stunned to see activity on her husband's account. South African helicopter pilot Cameron Dalziel and his wife Reine recently moved to Malaysia with their two children . 'People are abusing it in the Ukraine... They have no respect for each other, look what they're doing,' Mr Hattingh told CNN. 'It's no surprise that they were treating the remains of people like that. It made me angry beyond words.' The claims comes as a series of disturbing new allegations emerged that added further weight to claims pro-Russian rebels looted the MH17 crash scene to sabotage the investigation and cash in on the disaster. Desperate relatives revealed how they had called the mobile phones of their loves ones - only for them to be answered by strangers with 'eastern European-sounding voices'. After the initial shock, they immediately called the phone companies to shut down the accounts to prevent them being used, according to reports. Evidence of looting? The image appears to show a rebel fighter handling a gold ring amid the wreckage . Wreckage: A man looks at the debris scattered at the crash site of the downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, in a field near the village of Hrabove in the rebel-held Donetsk region of Ukraine . Tragic: A child's shoe is seen among the wreckage of MH17. A week after the disaster took place, the crash site is still littered with debris and, in some cases, body parts . Describing . the confusion in the minutes after the crash, the rebel was quoted as saying: 'Our commanders ordered us to get into the lorries . with our weapons and plenty of ammunition. Perhaps 10 minutes earlier, . there had been a huge explosion in the sky.' The men were allegedly told that white objects had been seen falling from the plane as it plummeted to the earth. These were wrongly assumed to have been parachutes and as such the men were told to prepare to fight to round up the military personal they mistakenly believed had been on the flight. 'All of a sudden, I saw scraps of material in a clearing,' he was quoted as saying. 'Underneath I found the body of a little girl, who can\u2019t have been more than five. She was lying face down. It was awful,' the militant added. 'That was when I realised it was a civilian plane. Not a military one. And all these dead people were civilians. A heap of burst suitcases confirmed it,' he went on to say. Care: Coffins containing the remains of MH17 are removed from a transport plane at Eindhoven airport.

The dignified reception at Eindhoven airport is in stark contrast to the treatment of the victims' remains in eastern Ukraine in the days after the crash, where pro-Russian rebels left corpses to decay in the summer heat in body bags dumped around the crash site.

Costs be damned. Well, not really. But those who moan and groan about the \"costs\" of the Olympic movement have to go a long way to convince me they are automatically bad for a city. Tokyo is a great, safe and hopefully cost effective choice to host the 2020 Summer Games. The Japanese capital achieved a crushing victory over rivals Istanbul and Madrid in Saturday's final International Olympic Committee (IOC) vote. As the Financial Times notes, the current budget projections are 0.2% of 2012 GDP. Plus, more than half of the $8 billion build-out cost projections is already set aside, the new hosts tell us. Construction firms are getting nice juicy contracts. Architects have already been hard at work. Full-time and part-time jobs will be created. Sure, the budget will rise. It always does. London tripled its initial budget estimates to $14 billion for the construction, security etc. and privately raised $3 billion or so to stage the games, from corporate sponsors, ticket sales and broadcasting rights. Construction money came from taxpayers and lottery funding. In fact, once London confirmed its final budget about five years before the Games, it stuck to it. It can be done. Now, Winter Olympics are a different proposition altogether as smaller cities have to contend with grand projects well beyond their normal needs. Many cities have been left with expensive white elephants in far flung places. Let's hope Sochi's $10bn budget (or more) is worth the cost as the government plans to make the area a year-round resort and also the site of big sporting events like a Formula One grand prix. And yes, you can always point to the abysmal state Montreal was left it with its stadium after 1976. It took something like 30 years to pay off. Montreal is the proverbial exception to the rule and was the warning sign for all cities to follow. It has rightfully scared the IOC and host cities into getting it right, or face financial headaches for years to come. Athens 2004 was also a prescription for how not to do it. Expensive white elephants still sit idle. The last minute \"Mediterranean\" rush to finish off some venues and infrastructure plans inevitably lead to higher costs. Atlanta '96 was no great success either, but for the start of the trend to plan the use of big venues, before the Games began. The Olympic Stadium was partially knocked down and used by the city's popular baseball team. Beijing and London went in other ways -- new stadia for the opening and closing ceremonies and athletics -- with a vow to keep the spirit of the Olympics in the building's bones. While Beijing's appears to be nothing more than a tourist attraction, London's will be home to a mix of football, athletics and already stands at the heart of a new urban park -- home to big named concerts and yes, lots of tourists. Speaking of tourists, those who stayed from London in droves last summer, were here this summer, I can tell you. I have not suffered from London being so busy as July and August just gone. London also got new train stations and better access to the east of the city. Sure, the poor in the area should have had that already, but now they do; along with new schools, swimming pools and housing. Could Olympic money be \"spent\" in better ways? Not likely. Governments often go over budget and over time when undertaking large infrastructure projects. The Olympics give cities one big, wonderful immoveable objective; a deadline. As Rio is now learning, there is no pressure like the pressure of IOC inspectors."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The author supports Olympic costs, noting Tokyo's $8 billion budget for 2020 and potential increases.

A woman who 'borrowed' a young girl as 'collateral' for a loan she had given to another villager kept the child chained to a post for eight hours a day over two years, it was revealed today. The shocking case of child abuse resulted in police taking the four-year-old girl's 'carer' into custody - but have now decided not to charge her out of pity for her own poverty-stricken circumstances. Police and child protection workers who went to a village hut near the Cambodian town of Kemarak Pumin found the girl sitting on the floor of the community building with a chain padlocked around her ankle, securing her to a post. Heartbreaking: A girl was tied to a post eight hours a day by a woman who 'borrowed' her as 'collateral' for a loan she had given to another villager . The Phnom Penh Post reported today that the girl had told police that on one occasion she was so thirsty that she had to drink her own urine. Last night the girl was in the care of social workers as the shocking circumstances of her imprisonment were revealed. Police said the 'adoptive mother', who had loaned money to the child's biological mother - had taken the four-year-old as collateral against a loan, but found it impossible to care for the girl during the day because she had to go to work. 'The adoptive mother said the girl used to get in rainwater and get messy and she feared she might leave the house and drown or get lost,' said Srey Touch, head of the local police human rights and juvenile protection unit. Released: The girl was found by police and child protection workers and placed in the care of social workers . The adoptive worked as a farmer at a plantation about half a mile from the hut and chained the child each workday from 7am to 11am and then from 1pm to 5pm, the paper reported. Police were alerted to the girl's plight by Keo Chhon, a 60-year-old village resident who told the Post: 'I felt so much pity for her. It is so bad. 'I think all children have the right to be cared for, not chained up like a dog. I wonder why the other workers didn't report it, but for me, I had to report it.' Despite the treatment the girl had suffered, her biological mother said she could still not take her back because of her poverty. 'I love her but I have no-one to look after her when I go to work,' she said, repeating what the adoptive mother had told police. Child abuse is common among poverty-stricken village families in Cambodia, particularly as adults are unaware of laws that protect youngsters. Chhan Sokunthea, head of the women and children's rights section of the child protection group Adhoc, said that youngsters are more often the subject of beatings and other abuse, . 'In Cambodia, 75 to 80 per cent are uneducated and they don't know how to care for their kids,' she said. 'Rarely is there a case where the nighbour or relative makes a complaint.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In Kemarak Pumin, Cambodia, a woman used a girl as loan collateral, chaining her due to work.

Sarah Palin, is completely unqualified to be president. (CNN) -- John McCain needs what Kinky Friedman calls \"a checkup from the neck up.\" In choosing Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate, he is not thinking \"outside the box,\" as some have said. More like out of his mind. Palin a first-term governor of a state with more reindeer than people, will have to put on a few pounds just to be a lightweight. Her personal story is impressive: former fisherman, mother of five. But that hardly qualifies her to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. For a man who is 72 years old and has had four bouts with cancer to have chosen someone so completely unqualified to become president is shockingly irresponsible. Suddenly, McCain's age and health become central issues in the campaign, as does his judgment. In choosing this featherweight, McCain passed over Tom Ridge, a decorated combat hero, a Cabinet secretary and the former two-term governor of the large, complex state of Pennsylvania. iReport.com: 'McCain pick might be a gimmick' He passed over Mitt Romney, who ran a big state, Massachusetts; a big company, Bain Capital; and a big event, the Olympics. He passed over Kay Bailey Hutchison, the Texas senator who is knowledgeable about the military, good on television and -- obviously -- a woman. He passed over Joe Lieberman, his best friend in the Senate and fellow Iraq Kool-Aid drinker. He passed over former congressman, trade negotiator and budget director Rob Portman. And he also passed over Mike Huckabee, the governor of Arkansas. For months, the McCainiacs have said they will run on his judgment and experience. In his first presidential decision, John McCain has shown that he is willing to endanger his country, potentially leaving it in the hands of someone who simply has no business being a heartbeat away from the most powerful, complicated, difficult job in human history.

A hospital could keep you warm and provide food and nursing care, but as surgeon and writer Atul Gawande pointed out, in many cases the patient would do no better than if he or she had stayed home. In those days, doctors who mastered the few techniques that could make a difference, such as setting fractures and treating certain kinds of heart conditions, were seemingly all-powerful, Gawande told the TED2012 conference in March. \"A doctor could kind of know it all and do it all,\" he said in an interview with CNN following his talk. Doctors were rewarded for being cowboys, for being daring and self sufficient. Today, the world of medicine promises and provides much more -- cures and care for many of the worst health problems people have. But doctors can no longer know everything and do everything. As medical knowledge has exploded, doctors increasingly must specialize in a field to absorb all the relevant information to treat a certain kind of illness. And a patient who goes to a hospital often winds up being treated and cared for by as many as 15 doctors, nurses and therapists, Gawande said. The result? \"Well, it's been a disaster,\" he said. \"We have 40 percent of coronary artery disease patients who receive incomplete or inappropriate care, we have 2 million people pick up infections in hospitals because one of those people on that team failed to follow basic hygiene practices.\" Watch Atul Gawande's TED Talk . \"Holding on to our streak of autonomy, each of us, we end up losing the patient in between,\" he said. Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, also is a researcher at Harvard University and a writer at The New Yorker. Today doctors are still often rewarded and trained as cowboys, but Gawande says what we really need are doctors who can function as members of a team, the way those in an auto racing pit crew work together to get vehicles back in the race. Ted.com: Trial, error and the God complex . Gawande has been a pioneer in advocating the use of checklists by medical teams working together in surgery or on other procedures. \"We've had checklists in medicine for people we considered the lowest on the totem pole, but the idea that the surgeon would have to follow a checklist is anathema,\" Gawande said. But in fact, he added, \"when checklists have been used to make sure even the best, most specialized doctors don't miss key steps in providing care ... we're finding that carefully designed checklists cut death rates in half in surgeries, that they can eliminate certain kinds of infections and that they can slash costs.\" Gawande has found reason to question the assumption that the most expensive care must be the best care. \"What we're discovering is that the best care, the places getting the best results, are often among the least expensive,\" he said. In those places, doctors and nurses providing care function like teams. \"We are going through a dramatic change where it's no longer about what your doctor knows, it's about what a team of doctors, nurses and others are able to do together.\" TED.com: Doctors make mistakes -- can we talk about that? These days Gawande brings a checklist with him into the operating room. At first, it was a bit of a shock for him. \"I did it reluctantly. I have been someone who believes, you know, do I need a checklist? No ... but i didn't want to be a hypocrite. I was bringing them to Tanzania and Seattle, so I started using a checklist myself. So that meant before the patient went to sleep we would do a series of checks -- not just, 'Do we have the right person and the right side of the body?' But also, 'Do we have a plan for what happens if this is a high-blood-loss case?' \"Before the incision, we'd introduce ourselves by name because it would turn out often that you would have a team of people working together for the first time who may not know each other very well. \"We discuss the plan in detail, and in doing these things I found from the very beginning that we were catching problems that we were missing otherwise. The anesthesiologist or the nurse was noticing things that I had missed. \"I have not gotten through a week of surgery in three years using this kind of checklist without it catching something that was a danger for the patient or would have made the care better.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In his TED Talk, Atul Gawande advocated for teamwork and checklists in medicine, challenging the belief that costlier care is better. He personally uses a checklist in the operating room, catching potential problems and improving patient care.

Knowing in advance what the price tag would be for the birth of their son gave the Bears \"peace of mind.\" The Omaha, Nebraska, couple went to Alegent Health's Web site and found the My Cost function, entered their insurance information and learned the hospital charges would be around $2,500, Bridget Bear said. When Bridget Bear gave birth to their son, Lawson, on April 2 at Lakeside Hospital -- a healthy 8-pound, 8-ounce baby -- the couple were ready for the bill, she said. Alegent is one of a growing number of hospitals, Web sites, even states, helping patients comparison shop on the Internet before undergoing a medical procedure or test. Hospitals say they're responding to a growing demand from patients who are paying for more of their health care out of pocket, thanks to rising deductibles and the advent of high deductible, consumer-driven plans like the Bears have. In the early 2000s, Bellin Health System in Green Bay, Wisconsin, began receiving more calls from patients wanting to know what a particular procedure would cost, said Jeff Hampton, director of revenue cycle management. \"As sad as it sounds, we had to say we didn't know,\" Hampton said. That's because something like knee replacement isn't one expense but many. There are the surgeon's fee, the operating room charge, equipment and supplies, the hospital bed during recovery, and other costs. Five years ago, Bellin put the information together so would-be patients could get an accurate picture of the final bill. On its Compare Care Line, a Bellin financial adviser provides an average cost from the previous six months for a given procedure and the price range over that time period. \"People are shopping around more,\" Hampton said. \"If consumers want to know what the cost of something is going to be, we should be able to give them an answer.\" Alegent, with nine hospitals in Nebraska and southwest Iowa, started My Cost in January 2007, posting the price of more than 500 tests and procedures along with data on quality of care. Integris Health, a 14-hospital system in Oklahoma City, has a Consumer Price Line number that allows patients to learn what the out-of-pocket costs will be for their procedures. The service started in July 2007 after CEO Stanley Hupfeld had some \"secret shoppers\" try to get pricing information, said Nicole White, Integris spokesperson. Consumer Price Line receives between 800 and 1,000 calls a month, she said. Sixteen state hospital associations operate Web sites that allow comparison shopping for such inpatient procedures as appendectomies, maternity stays and knee or hip replacements: Georgia, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin. Other states have their own systems. Minnesota health care providers collaborated on the HealthScores Web site, which allows price comparisons between 110 providers for 103 common medical procedures. The Web site tells what insurance companies pay, on average, for procedures ranging from Caesarean delivery to a colonoscopy. Pennsylvania has detailed price information on cardiac and joint replacement surgeries on its Health Care Cost Containment Council Web site, but the data are several years old. Still, it underscores the enormous differences in prices. For example, knee replacement costs ranged from $11,243 to $97,031 at the state's hospitals. Even individual hopsitals are striving to offer more transparency. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, posts very detailed information about prices on the hospital's Web site. Spokesperson Jason Aldous said it's part of the medical center's mission to provide transparency about cost, outcomes and patient satisfaction. The information is only a starting point, though, Aldous said. \"We want that to drive you to a more informed conversation\" with a doctor, he said. \"A bilateral knee replacement is not like buying a car on the lot.\" But Brad Myers, co-founder of New Choice Health, said health care and car buying are a lot more similar than many people think. The eight-month-old site was created to do for health care what automobile pricing guides did for new car buying 20 years ago, Myers said. New Choice Health, which does not charge for its service, lists the average cost insurance companies pay for 400 different procedures at different facilities across the country. Want to know the cost of a colonoscopy in Cleveland? New Choice Health gives you more than 50 facilities, with prices ranging from $550 to $1,200. How about a PET scan in Portland? The site offers more than 20 facilities with a price range of $1,600 to $2,100. The site is designed for people who are uninsured, individually insured or with a high deductible plan, Myers said. Patients who are not covered in a group plan generally get bills three times as high, he said. He advocates bargaining. \"Just picking up the phone will get you 20 percent off. Nine times out of 10, if you want to haggle, it's more like 50 percent off,\" Myers says. New Choice Health, which went live in January, now gets 40,000 to 50,000 users a month, Myers says. Paul Fronstin, a senior research associate with the Employee Benefit Research Institute, said cost sites such as New Choice Health are crude tools because they don't tell people with traditional plans what they'll pay out of pocket. A lot depends on how much of their deductible they've already spent. Also, people with expensive chronic diseases such as diabetes usually reach their deductible early in the year and are less concerned about price after that, Fronstin said. Childbirth is a perfect procedure to price ahead of time, according to Kathleen Stoll at Families USA. Others are not as clear cut. With knee surgery, for example, patients may not know the exact procedure they need or what complications could arise, she said. Bridget Bear said knowing what hospital fees would be in advance gave her and her husband peace of mind: \"We were able to enjoy the anticipation of Lawson a little bit more instead of having to worry about the financial piece of it.\" CNN's Sabriya Rice contributed to this report."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Bears used Alegent Health's My Cost function to estimate their childbirth cost.

A pair of identical twin brothers who were caught fighting in a barbaric street brawl have both been given the same jail sentence - because police can\u2019t tell them apart. Ryan and Grant Seymour, 19, were caught on CCTV - both naked from the waist up - taking part in mass violence, in Biddulph, Staffordshire, on July 6 last year. A court heard the siblings were seen pelting missiles including a portable television at members of a 'rival' family. Identical twin brothers Ryan and Grant Seymour were caught fighting in a barbaric street brawl and have both been given the same jail sentence - because police can't tell them apart . A court heard the twins also hurled vases and bottles at their victims\u00a0 - with one brother attacking a group of men with a spanner. But because the brothers are almost impossible to tell apart it was 'unclear who did what' as both were naked from the waist up and wearing blue shorts. They have both sentenced to nine months' detention at a young offenders institute after officers could not work out which one had been involved in more of the violence. Jailing the pair at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, Judge Paul Glenn said: 'Your conduct has been described by witnesses as mayhem, barbaric and vile. 'You were not the only people to behave disgracefully. 'There was undoubted provocation. 'A group of other men visited the house to cause trouble. Pictured is Ryan Seymour.  He and his twin were caught on CCTV  - both naked from the waist up - taking part in mass violence, in Biddulph, Staffordshire, on July 6 last year . A court heard the siblings were seen pelting missiles including a portable television at members of a 'rival' family. Pictured is Grant Seymour . 'That was the catalyst for what followed. 'The trouble started in the house and spilled out onto the street. We can see from the CCTV how close this was to the centre of Biddulph.' The court heard the vicious attack was sparked when members of the Yoxall family banged on the door of the twins\u2019 friend Daniel Tatters\u2019s home. Prosecuting Oliver Woolhouse, said: 'A witness living in South View described hearing a disturbance in the street. 'He could see from his living room window four men go into a house. 'A short time later a man was heard hammering on the door, it was opened and he went inside, followed by six others. 'A Peugeot 306 car and a van appeared and the occupants of the car got out and stood by the front door. 'A man then appeared, he was bleeding heavily from his head and was followed by the rest of the men. 'They were shouting at each other and there was something of a stand-off. The twins also hurled missiles at their victims\u00a0 - with one brother attacking a group of men with a spanner. But because the brothers (left Ryan and right Grant) are impossible to tell apart it was 'unclear who did what' Probably the most famous twins in criminal history were Ronnie and Reggie Kray from Bethnal Green in east London. It was reported that early on in their careers, both twins were arrested for a particularly vicious assault but the police did not prosecute because they could not identify which twin was the assailant. Since identical twins - also known as monozygotic twins - come from the same fertilised egg, it was believed that they have the same DNA. However, a new test is being developed which would enable twins' DNA to be told apart by scientists in Germany. They have found a subtle genetic difference which means there is now a definitive test to learn which twin was at the scene of a crime. This breakthrough will stop the current procedure whereby one twin might escape justice because of the inability of the authorities to tell them apart. 'The witness says one of the twins had a small portable TV that was thrown through the car window. 'Glass bottles and vases were also thrown at the vehicle before the driver of the car attempted to drive away. 'One of the twins then attacked the vehicle with a large metal spanner. His arm was bleeding.' The pair both admitted one count of affray and Ryan was also caged for a further 15 months to run consecutively for an unrelated affray for an earlier incident. Jason Holt, defending Ryan, said: 'It is accepted that the other family came to the house of Daniel Tatters and that\u2019s what caused this incident in the first place. 'They even blocked both ends of the road with a car and a van. 'Mr Seymour has matured since this incident, he is no longer the angry man he once was. 'He even apologises to the people of South View who saw this going on.' Robert Smith, defending Grant, added: 'Since this offence in July last year there has not been any further incident involving Grant. 'He is now a roofer and has stuck at it. He has reduced his drinking and now has a stable life. He has been out of trouble.' Co-accused, Daniel Tatters, 29, and Peter Holland, 36, both from Biddulph, were each handed a 12-month community order, with supervision for 12 months, and ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Identical twins Ryan and Grant Seymour were sentenced to nine months for a brawl at Daniel Tatters's home.

It comes after the furore over Fiji-born Lance Corporal Bale Baleiwai, a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, who was threatened with deportation because he was disciplined by his commanding officer for a fight with a colleague in 2010. Following an outcry, he was granted an 11th hour reprieve. Campaigners for Pte Lacanivalu will contrast his case with that of foreigners who have been allowed to stay in Britain despite awful crimes, such as Iraqi Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, who left a girl of 12 to die under the wheels of his car. His case also appears at odds with Mr Cameron\u2019s pledge to uphold the Military Covenant, society\u2019s duty of care to servicemen. Pleae: Pte Lacanivalu has begged the Prime Minister to intervene and let him stay in the country because of his military service . Pte Lacanivale, whose uncles served in the Army, including one who fought with the Parachute Regiment in the Falklands, signed up with 2 YORKS in 2001 after seeing photographs of ceremonial parades at Buckingham Palace. He served in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, the Falklands and deployed on two tours of fierce fighting in Afghanistan. He said: \u2018That was the first time for me to see people getting wounded and killed.\u2019 He left the Forces in January 2010 but several months later received documents from the Army informing him he should have applied for residency within 28 days. The soldier claimed he was not told of this requirement while in the Army. He hired a solicitor to issue a belated application to remain in Britain but he was informed in September he had been rejected. On October 12 he went to a Home Office centre in Croydon, South London, hoping to resolve the situation but he was detained without being allowed to return to his flat to collect his belongings. Now Vinita Templeton, a solicitor with law firm Duncan Lewis, is planning to launch a judicial review action against his detention, which would include an application to block Pte Lacanivalu\u2019s imminent deportation. Ian Sadler, the father of Trooper Jack Sadler, killed in Afghanistan while Pte Lacanivalu was on the frontline, said he was \u2018dismayed\u2019 by the situation. He said: \u2018He should be put up in a hotel and a civil servant should straighten this out.\u2019 A Home Office spokesman said: \u2018Mr Lacanivalu applied to stay in the UK outside of the period. However, due to his service with the Army his case is now under review.\u2019"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Filimone Lacanivalu, a former British Army soldier, faces deportation due to a missed residency application.

UPDATED: . 07:19 EST, 4 December 2013 . The BBC has admitted faking key scenes in a hit nature documentary about grizzly bears. Programme makers were forced to apologise after it emerged hit BBC1 show Great Bear Stakeout deliberately misled viewers by carefully editing footage. A dramatic episode appeared to show one of the documentary's expert guides watching and commentating as a mother bear took her cubs into the ocean, before one of them drowned. In fact, the guide \u2013 Chris Morgan \u2013 was never present at the touching scene. Filmed separately, the shots of him standing by the seaside were later edited together with the original footage to make it seem he was just yards from the dangerous animals. The truth was only revealed yesterday \u2013 more than seven months after it was aired on TV \u2013 after an investigation by the BBC\u2019s governing body found the public were \u2018misled\u2019 and trust in the BBC could be damaged. Up close, but not too close: A bear inspects a remote camera in the documentary Great Bear Stakeout. But the show has been criticised for being less than honest . It is the latest in a series of fakery rows to engulf the BBC\u2019s respected natural history unit, and comes just two years after it was revealed Sir David Attenborough\u2019s Frozen Planet series had shown supposedly wild footage of a polar bear and her cubs \u2013 which was actually filmed in a zoo. Last night Tory MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said it was \u2018completely unacceptable\u2019 to fake footage, adding: \u2018It is wrong to mislead viewers, and as has been the case in the past, if you have to edit footage so things are not exactly as they were, you should explain to viewers why that has happened. \u2018Otherwise, the danger is people stop believing in the truth of these programmes and viewers\u2019 confidence in the BBC\u2019s output will be undermined. \u2018I welcome the fact the BBC Trust have recognised that this was misleading and wrong.\u2019 In its damning report yesterday, the corporation\u2019s governing body admitted the latest scandal could further damage the public\u2019s faith in its output. It said: \u2018Viewers were on a journey with the guide and this was a crucial event which was interpreted through the eyes of the guide. On location? The Great Bear Stakeout team, including Chris Morgan (centre), pose up for the camera at Katmal National Park, Alaska . \u2018The Trustees agreed that it was not acceptable to portray him as if he was present when he was not present. The public had been misled.\u2019 Saying the BBC\u2019s natural history programming is \u2018one of the jewels in the crown of British broadcasting\u2019, the BBC Trust report continued: \u2018Enactments of this nature could undermine the trust of the public in the BBC\u2019s natural history programmes and even risked casting doubt on the accuracy of the natural history depicted in the BBC\u2019s programmes. \u2018This would be an extremely unfortunate outcome which could damage a world class brand.\u2019 Filmed in Alaska, Great Bear Stakeout drew plaudits when it was screened in April and captivated almost four million viewers. The fake scene \u2013 contained in the first of four episodes \u2013 showed a mother bear, Parsnip, taking her two cubs Pushki and Wren into the ocean. Wren was washed away by the waves and presumed drowned. 'It is wrong to mislead viewers and, . as has been the case in the past, if you have to edit footage so things . are not exactly as they were, you should explain to viewers why that has . happened. Otherwise . the danger is people stop believing in the truth of these programmes . and viewers\u2019 confidence in the BBC\u2019s output will be undermined' - MP John Whittingdale . The BBC Trust said producers gave repeated reassurances the shot was accurate. They did not reveal the true sequence of events because they felt it was \u2018acceptable\u2019 and \u2018did not alter the editorial truth of the scene\u2019. The report added: \u2018It was only when a planned radio interview proposed to feature the cub-drowning sequence that the bear guide flagged up the fact that he had not actually been present at the time.\u2019 In the wake of the revelations, the BBC required all natural history staff to carry out new training into editorial standards. The show\u2019s executive producer Gavin Henderson said: \u2018Please accept my apologies for this mistake. The Natural History Unit is taking immediate steps to address the issues raised and to prevent similar issues occurring by providing additional training across the entire unit.\u2019 Following the Frozen Planet scandal in 2011, Sir David Attenborough \u2013 who narrated the series \u2013 defended the footage by saying he was \u2018making movies\u2019.

Spared jail: Would-be teacher Abi Ellis appearing at Truro Crown Court after attacking another girl on a night out by biting her face . A pretty undergraduate and wannabe teacher who has twice BITTEN women in the face during boozed up brawls has been spared jail. Violent Abi Ellis, 20, sank her teeth into startled Katie Roberts during her most recent attack - after the two women clashed outside a nightclub. Ellis is prone to losing her temper and when she does she likes to lash out and 'bite', a court was told. The latest 'violent and extremely antisocial' assault left Miss Roberts with a gaping wound to her cheek which later became infected. Both girls had gone to Falmouth School but the former pupils were not friends, Truro Crown Court in Cornwall heard. The pair were attending separate birthday parties when Ellis spilt a drink on Miss Roberts and they exchanged words. Trouble flared again outside Truro\u2019s L2 nightspot when Katie went to get in a pre-booked taxi with her brother - only to find Ellis in the vehicle. But when Katie asked Ellis what she was doing, the brunette attacked her and bit into her left cheek. She was found guilty of causing actual bodily harm, ordered to carry out a community order for 12 months, undertake 180 hours unpaid work and pay her victim \u00a3500. The court heard Ellis had been cautioned by police in June 2011 for a similar incident involving another girl. Thomas Bradnock, prosecuting, said: 'You bit her I suggest because that is what you do when you lose your temper, isn\u2019t it? You bite. 'It is what happened almost a year previously with a different girl.' Katie told the court: 'I was obviously very shocked that she was in my brother\u2019s taxi and I said, \u2018what is she doing?\u2019 'She launched at me and by that time her teeth were in my cheek and gripped on very tightly. I touched my cheek and there was blood on my hand. I was very emotional.' Scene: The disagreement occurred outside Truro's L2 nightclub, which resulted in Ms Ellis biting a fellow reveller's cheek . The wound later became infected and Katie, reported the attack shortly after it happened on December 18, 2011. Ellis spent Christmas in Ireland before travelling to Thailand, where she spent nine months teaching English, but was arrested upon her return.

A bitter husband posted pictures of his estranged wife on an adult website with a message declaring she would 'do anything for \u00a340'. Michael Anderson, 49, posted holiday snaps of his wife Michelle - with whom he has two children - in a bikini on a website called Hot Mums and MILFs. Anderson, who pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment without violence yesterday, added a comment which said his estranged wife of 22 years could 'go to the highest bidder', a court heard. Harassment: Michael Anderson, seen left outside court\u00a0 yesterday, posted holiday pictures of his estranged wife Michelle, right, in a bikini on an adult website . Anderson posted a link to the adult webpage on Facebook after adding the holiday photographs. 'Devastated' Mrs Anderson, 42, called the police when friends called her to tell her what he had done, and her estranged husband was arrested. Anderson was given a three-month community order at South Tyneside Magistrates' Court yesterday, and made the subject of an indefinite restraining order banning him from making contact with his ex. Mrs Anderson said in an interview after the hearing that the former couple, who have two sons, split in October when she learned he had cheated on her with one of her close friends. But Anderson embarked on a campaign of harassment after she left him, Mrs Anderson said. 'He did not take the news well, bombarding me with texts and phone calls and even threatening to kill himself,' she said. 'In January he put the pictures on the Hot Mums and MILFs website and then posted a link to the page on Facebook. 'My friends started texting me and calling me to let me know what he had done. 'I wasn't friends with Michael on Facebook anymore, but my mates sent me the link. 'I was devastated when I saw the pictures and what he had written, it was horrific. 'I was so embarrassed,' said Mrs Anderson, who added that her ex had written that she would 'do anything for \u00a340'. 'There were photos taken of me on holiday and I was wearing a bikini.' Mrs Anderson said the pictures were taken down after she called the police. 'They were online for about three hours altogether, but it was long enough,' said the mother-of-two, who said she wants to 'put him behind me and concentrate on my two children'. At yesterday's court hearing Paul Doney, prosecuting, told the court that the harassment all took place between the beginning of January and early February this year. 'The victim said he had been very controlling,' he said. 'Unpleasant': Anderson is seen with estranged wife Michelle in a photograph taken on a family holiday . 'On January 4 she was in the Chichester Arms in South Shields with one of their sons, who was playing in a poker tournament. 'At one point he went up to their son and said he was going to knock her head off. 'Later that day he turned up at her house and started shouting before trying to open the kitchen window.' Anderson was warned by the police to keep away from his former wife, but later in January he turned up at the house demanding a computer from her that he claimed was his. Mr Doney added: 'She then found out that he had posted holiday photographs of her in a bikini on this site, saying she would do anything for \u00a340 and could go to the highest bidder.' A statement from Mrs Anderson read out in court said he had been making her life 'hell'. It said: 'I was scared of physical and emotional violence and feel like I am being stalked. 'He is making my life hell and he knows it.' Charlton James Carr, defending, said: 'It all happened in the aftermath of Christmas, a particularly emotional time for families. 'But since this happened there have been no more problems and everyone has got back on with their lives.' Magistrates read a report about Anderson from the probation service before sentencing him. Chairman of the bench Gordon Minto said: 'You appear to have a complete lack of acknowledgement that there was anything untoward about your behaviour. 'We don't see any evidence that you understand what you did was wrong - which makes this particularly unpleasant. 'The only saving grace is that this seems to have stopped.'

It was July 27, Liverpool had just breezed past Olympiakos in a pre-season friendly. After Gerrard had dealt with the thorny issue of what happened during the title run-in last April, then discussed what would happen in the post Luis Suarez era, the conversation turned to Frank Lampard. His old England colleague had just decided to embark on a fresh challenge in the MLS and it was put to Gerrard whether he could ever envisage a life beyond Liverpool. This was his response. Gerrard has only ever played for Liverpool, winning the Champions League in Istanbul in 2005 . Gerrard has been an inspirational captain for more than a decade, leading the team since 2003 . Gerrard was instrumental in his sides run to the Champions League final in 2005 to win their fifth European title . \u2018At his age of 36, he\u2019s had a wonderful career and I don\u2019t think he has anything to prove in England anymore,\u2019 said Gerrard. \u2018He\u2019s broken records with Chelsea and won everything with them. I think it\u2019s a perfect move for him at his time. One day that might happen to me, I don\u2019t know. \u2018I\u2019ve never really discussed it with anyone or thought about it. Maybe one day I would like the chance to go away from Liverpool for a short time and try something different. But I haven\u2019t given it much thought. That carrot hasn\u2019t been dangled yet.\u2019 Now it has and it has prompted Gerrard to make a heart-rending decision. From May 23, Liverpool Football Club will no longer have their talismanic No 8 to turn to. There was always going to be a day when Liverpool and Gerrard were no more but, even still, the news takes some getting used to. Like Jamie Carragher (left) Gerrard's departure will leave a void that is impossible to fill . Liverpool now have a job to do replacing two club legends who will leave within two years of each other . Gerrard has been offered a new deal by his club, but will not sign a deal beyond the end of the season . Gerrard was man of the match in the 2006 FA Cup final, scoring twice to help Liverpool lift the trophy . Gerrard fast established himself as a fans favourite and has stayed with Liverpool for 17 years . There has been a lot of noise this season about Gerrard, his form and whether he can still contribute in the Barclays Premier League. He might not be the rampaging force of nature who, 10 years ago, inspired that night in Istanbul but his role runs deeper than what happens on the pitch. Gerrard, along with Jamie Carragher, provided the heart and soul to Liverpool during countless changes since the turn of the Millennium and has always been on hand to say or do the right thing at the right time. They had been the link between the terrace and the squad. Carragher has never been adequately replaced in the 18 months since his retirement but if manager Brendan Rodgers had a hard job looking for a new No 23, he is now faced with an impossible challenge to find someone who will adequately fill that No 8 jersey. Gerrard has never won the Premier League title, coming closest last season when Liverpool fell just short . Since making his Liverpool debut in 1998 Gerrard has played almost 500 league games for the club . This decision is something Gerrard has been wrestling with for months, the excitement of pursuing a new challenge somewhere else always being counterbalanced by the love and affinity he has for Liverpool, the club he grew up dreaming he would one day represent. He will not want the next five months to become overly nostalgic and he will be committed to helping Liverpool obtain their highest possible finish in the Premier League, while hoping that, perhaps, there will be one final day at Wembley. Once the end of May arrives, though, that will be it.

Just days before they tied the knot, the 30-year-old, who is thought to be preparing a bid to become an MP, and his mother completed on the sale of the new property in Marylebone. The impressive house boasts a master bedroom with en-suite bathroom, two further bathrooms and two reception rooms and is close to Regents Park. The couple moved after selling their previous home, also in Marylebone. The four-storey property bought for \u00a31.29million in 2010 was put on the market for \u00a32.35million. Three years later the house has been sold for \u00a32.15million, netting the Blairs \u00a3860,000 in profit. Euan and his mother paid \u00a33,625,000 for the six-bedroom new house, a short walk from their previous home. Cherie has interests in eight properties, with a total value of around \u00a324million. Euan recently moved from his job at investment bank Morgan Stanley, taking up a new post at Sarina Russo Job Access, a Coventry-based recruitment agency. It was seen as an indication that Tony Blair's eldest son was preparing to run for MP. However Labour has already selected its candidate for the Coventry North East seat, rumoured to be the 30-year-old's preferred target, leaving him with a six-year wait for the 2020 General Election, his first chance of becoming an MP for the constituency."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Euan and Suzanne Blair's new \u00a33.6million Georgian townhouse is co-owned by Euan and Cherie Blair.

You log on and are tempted by a wireless Internet provider offering free Internet access. So, do you take it? Wi-Fi users have been warned to protect their computers against potential hackers at Wi-Fi hotspots. Security experts warn that hackers may be masquerading as free public Wi-Fi providers to gain access to the laptops of unsuspecting travelers. All it takes, they say, is a computer program downloaded from the Internet, an open access point and a user who has ignored basic security advice. \"The difficulty for travelers is differentiating between a good Internet access hotspot and a rogue, or somebody trying to actually glean credentials from you. The issue is that you don't necessarily know the difference between a good and a bad one,\" computer security expert Sean Remnant told CNN. In 2008, AirTight Networks dispatched a number of so-called \"white hat\" hackers to 27 airports around the world to test the vulnerability of their Wi-Fi systems. They found that 80 percent of the private Wi-Fi networks tested were open or poorly protected. The wireless security company also found that basic services at several airports, including baggage handling systems, were vulnerable to hackers. Operators were using Wired Equivalent Privacy, known as WEP, which was found to provide inadequate protection to hackers as early as 2001. One year after the survey was conducted, CNN Business Traveler met Remnant at London's Heathrow airport, which was not included in the original survey, to test the potential dangers to unprotected Wi-Fi users.  Watch what happened when we took a hacker to Heathrow \u00bb . Armed with a laptop, our \"white hat\" hacker took a seat in the crowded departure lounge at Terminal 3 and proceeded to scan the airwaves with his laptop, using a program he downloaded form the Internet called Airodump. \"It dumps everything in the air,\" Remnant explained. \"So if I execute the command to start Airodump, instantly I'm seeing probably 20 wireless networks with four or five of those having relatively weak server security.\" \"There are several risks just on this screen,\" he continued. \"One is that we actually don't know whether the public networks are legitimate or not.\" The original survey conducted by AirTight Networks found the most common name for rogue Wi-Fi points was \"Free Public Wi-Fi.\" \"You'd have no idea if somebody sitting down to a laptop was a casual traveler trying to collect their email from an open port, or actually they were setting up a rogue access point,\" Remnant said. \"Your security guys in the airport aren't going to spot someone doing this because it's a technical thing,\" he added. Once connected, the hacker would have access to everything on your screen, from passwords, to bank account details, to the contents of e-mails. Do you suspect you've been a victim of Wi-Fi hacking? Tell us your story in Sound Off . And it's not just happening at airports. The rapid spread of Wi-Fi networks to cafes, hotels and even entire cities is providing hackers with more opportunities to ply their trade. Last month, Venice rolled out what is believed to be Europe's most extensive Wi-Fi network. According to mobile media company Jiwire, there are now more than 273,000 free and pay Wi-Fi locations in 140 countries. The majority can be found in the United States, China, the United Kingdom and France. And most hotspots are located in hotels, along with cafes and restaurants. However, the Wi-Fi Alliance, an industry group that tests and certifies Wi-Fi equipment, says the increased availability of Wi-Fi has not led to a rise in hacking cases. \"We certainly haven't seen any kind of sudden epidemic of hackers in open hotspots or anything like that,\" said the group's marketing director, Kelly Davis-Felner. She said all Wi-Fi enabled devices have in-built security measures, and all users need to do is to switch them on. The most up-to-date wireless security system is WPA2, which provides greater protection than its predecessors WPA and WEP. \"If you're updating Facebook, or checking your personal e-mail or surfing the Web, there's really no reason at all to worry about using an open network,\" Davis-Felner said. \"Any kind of online shopping or banking or anything that would require you to exchange sensitive data over the airwaves, then we advise people to exercise caution.\" The best way to protect sensitive information is to use a Virtual Private Network, or VPN, which encrypts the data moving to and from your laptop. Kiran Deshpande, president of AirTight Networks, had this advice for travelers: \"Connect only to the networks that you trust. Make sure that your communication is secure, disconnect the wireless when you stop using it, and maintain the list of wireless connections that you use on your laptop so that you don't accidentally connect to networks that may spring up when you're traveling.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hackers can pose as free Wi-Fi providers, exploiting open access points and internet programs.

Airodump demonstrated this vulnerability. The Wi-Fi Alliance, however, reports no rise in hacking cases despite increased Wi-Fi availability. A VPN is recommended for protection."}]}

Climate change is threatening U.S. landmarks from the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour to the launchpads at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. A new study has revealed the full extent of the crisis facing America's most cherised landmarks - and says almost two dozen are at risk. They include Boston's historic districts, the Harriet Tubman National Monument in Maryland and an array of Nasa sites including the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The new report says the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbour (left) to the launchpads at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center (right) are at risk, also named were The Castillo de San Marcos (top middle), the oldest masonry fort in North America and parts of Boston . Landmarks at risk include the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York Harbor, which was the entry point for 14 million immigrants from 1886 to 1924. Sea level has risen 12 inches (30 centimeters) around New York City over the past century, the report said. Then came Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which flooded most of Liberty Island and all of Ellis Island, destroying most of their infrastructure and forcing their closure for months. New York is now rebuilding electrical systems on the islands 'as much as 20 feet above sea level and designing the heating and air conditioning systems to withstand flooding,' the report said. Other sites at risk include the first permanent British colony in North America at Jamestown Island in Virginia, and historic Charleston, South Carolina. Another is Fort Monroe, where the first African slaves arrived in 1619 and where 250 years later they were given refuge as 'contraband' of the American Civil War, a move that paved the way for the abolition of slavery. Also under threat are the C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez National Monument in Keene, California with floods, rising sea levels and fires, scientists said on Tuesday. National Landmarks at Risk, a report published by the Washington-based Union of Concerned Scientists, highlighted more than two dozen sites that potentially face serious natural disasters. 'The imminent risks to these sites and the artifacts they contain threaten to pull apart the quilt that tells the story of the nation's heritage and history,' Adam Markham, director of climate impacts at the union, a non-profit organization for science advocacy in Washington D.C. and the study's co-author, said in a statement. The report is not slated for publication in a scientific journal, said Brenda Ekwurzel, senior climate scientist who co-authored the report. It said that reducing carbon emissions could minimize the predicted risks posed by climate change. 'We must prepare our cherished landmarks for these worsening climate impacts and take steps to make climate resilience a national priority,' the scientists wrote. Where could be affected? 'At the same time, we must work to minimize these risks in the future by reducing the carbon emissions that are causing climate change and its accompanying impacts.' The report highlights 30 at-risk locations chosen because the science behind the risks they face is robust, and because together they shine a spotlight on the different kinds of climate impacts already affecting the United States' cultural heritage, the team said. At some sites -\u00a0 such as Liberty and Ellis Islands and Cape Hatteras - steps have already been taken to prepare for these growing climate risks. At many other sites, such efforts have not yet begun. 'As these case studies illustrate, climate change is no longer a distant threat for others to worry about,' the team said. 'The consequences are already underway, with serious and growing risks to the places and communities we care about.' Alaska: Cape Krusenstern National Monument and Kivalina -- Bering Land Bridge National Monument and Shishmaref . California: Groveland -- C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez National Monument -- NASA Ames Research Center . Colorado: Mesa Verde National Park . Florida: Castillo de San Marcos, Fort Mose, St. Augustine's historic downtown, and the Lincolnville Historic District in St. Augustine -- Prehistoric shell structures at Ten Thousand Islands and Canaveral National Seashore -- NASA Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral . Hawaii: Kaloko-Honok\u014dhau and Pu'uhonua o H\u014dnaunau National Historic Parks . Louisiana: NASA Michoud Assembly Facility . Maryland: Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument -- Historic Annapolis and U.S. Naval Academy . Massachusetts: Boston's Faneuil Hall and the Blackstone Block Historic District .

South Carolina: Charleston's Historic District . Texas: Johnson Space Center . Virginia: Historic Jamestown -- Fort Monroe National Monument -- NASA Wallops Flight Facility and Langley Research Center . The report concluded that action must be taken now. 'If future generations of Americans are to experience the joy and wonder that these extraordinary places engender, we must act now to protect them from the impacts of climate change today and prepare them for expected additional changes tomorrow. 'We must also take steps to minimize the risks of climate change in the future by taking immediate action to reduce the carbon emissions that are driving up the planet's temperature. 'The historic legacy of the United States is at stake.' Drastic change: The Jefferson Memorial in Washington DC one day may only be accessible by boat . Jamestown, Virginia - the first permanent English colony - could be completely inundated due to rising sea levels, and the nearby Fort Monroe, 'will become an island unto itself within 70 years,' Markham said. In the western United States, rising temperatures have led to an increase in wildfires by melting winter snowpacks earlier, leaving forests drier for longer, the report said. Among California's 20 largest fires since 1932, a dozen have happened since 2002, the report said. An unrelated report published on Monday showed that the California drought has cost thousands of jobs and $1.7 billion to farmers in the state's Central Valley. Governor Jerry Brown has partly blamed climate change for the drought. Earlier this months Scientists warned that vast glaciers in West Antarctica are locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming \u2013 and created incredible images show the effect the melt would have on some of the U.S\u2019s classic coastal city areas. Experts say the melt could add 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 meters) to current sea levels in a few hundred years and the images illustrate the impact this increase would have on cities including Miami, Boston and San Francisco. The photographs were developed by Pittsburgh-based digital artist Nickolay Lamm, based on sea level-rise mapping data from Climate Central. Watery Boston: This image shows what the city's Back Bay would look like if sea levels rose by 12 feet, with roads leading to the bay completely submerged . Soggy playing conditions: AT&T Park in San Francisco would need to become a water polo venue, according to Nickolay Lamm's digital imaging . Flooded: The San Diego Convention Center would be completely unusable if sea levels rose by 12 feet, with water almost encroaching onto the road next to it . Venice Beach: Los Angeles' famous coastal hot-spot might only be navigable by canoe in the future, with the beach totally submerged by the waters of the Pacific . Road to nowhere: Miami's Ocean Drive is a popular spot for a stroll and a cruise, but in a few hundred years it might be better suited to fishing expeditions . In the shocking pictures the Jefferson Memorial in Washington D.C is surrounded by water, Ocean Drive in Miami looks like it would only be navigable by boat and Crissy Field in San Francisco is mostly under water. And you'd need waders to walk around The San Diego Convention Center, according to the predictions. A Nasa study looking at 40 years of ground, airplane and satellite data shows the melt is happening faster than scientists had predicted, crossing a critical threshold that has begun a domino-like process. Some scientists believe that a build-up of man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is affecting wind patterns around Antarctica, driving warmer waters towards the continent. Bob Ward, from the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy at London School of Economics and Political Science, said: 'Although such extreme sea level rise is only likely to occur after several centuries of global warming, these startling images should help U.S politicians and the public to understand the scale of the risks created by climate change.' Alarming: The Boston Harbor Hotel will need more than a few sandbags in the future to keep the water out, if Climate Central is correct .

The 72-year-old, who achieved international acclaim for The World According to Garp and The Cider House Rules, designed the Dorset, Vermont, mansion with his wife Janet. Their aim was to create a property that was both a work space and a retreat. The couple finished building it in 1989, and 25 years on, they are selling up. Novelist John Irving is selling his 8,300 square-foot five-bedroom home in Dorset, Vermont, for $3million . The luxury mansion, which sits on 11.53 acres, has a swimming pool and stunning views across the hills . The 8,300-square-foot estate, being sold through Sothebys, offers five large bedrooms, six bathrooms and most importantly for the award-winning author 'the ability to get up in the morning and simply go to work where you live'. It also has a gym with a full-sized wrestling court, allowing Mr Irving to practice his beloved sport, all spread across across nearly 12 acres of private land equipped with tennis courts and a pool. There is also a large office where Mr Irving would spend up to nine hours a day writing. He would have to wear a hat and sunglasses while at his desk because so much light is let in. A large shower, bathroom and private sauna complete the first floor. The master bedroom offers a sitting area, large fitted closet, expansive bath, and separate ladies dressing room . The writer holds up his Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay with The Cider House Rules in 2000. After 25 years living in the Vermont house with his wife, he has decided to move to an apartment in Toronto . Mr Irving, who achieved critical acclaim for his novels including The World According to Garp and Cider House Rules, said he wanted to create a home which could be both a retreat and a place of work . One of the reasons he chose the location was because of the spectacular views of the Green Mountains . The property has a gym which includes a range of equipment including rowing machines and exercise bikes . 'It's not only the house that I've been in the longest,' says the writer, 'but I have to say, it's been a very happy period in my life that I've been living here.' According to the Wall Street Journal, Ms Irving fitted the home with furniture she said wasn't 'precious' and could be used by the family. Irving achieved critical and popular acclaim after the international success of The World According to Garp in 1978. The Cider House Rules (1985), which was later turned into a film starring Michael Caine, and A Prayer for Owen Meany (1989), have also been bestsellers. The room also has a full-sized wrestling court. Photos show Irving playing the sport as he grew up. He was a wrestling coach as well as a wrestler in high school and college . In 1999, after nearly 10 years in development, Irving's screenplay for The Cider House Rules was made into a film and earned Irving an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. He is now said to be finishing his 14th novel, Avenue of Mysteries, about an older Mexican-American man who travels to the Philippines and reflects on his childhood in Mexico. The couple are now moving to their apartment in Toronto. Mr Irving's main concern, according to the Journal, is that he won't have enough room for the hundreds of family photos he has of his family. Pictured is the novelist's author where he spends up to eight hours a day writing by hand . Potential petrol-headed residents will be able to fit three cars in this enormous garage that sits at the back of the sprawling property . Around the side of the house is a stone terrace which also offers spectacular views of the surrounding area . The master suite offers a sitting area, large fitted closet, expansive bath, and separate ladies dressing room . The dining room, which has easy access to the wet bar and kitchen, is perfect for entertaining guests . Ms Irving is said to have fitted the home with furniture she did not consider to be 'precious' so it could be used by all members of the family . Following a day of working or walking in the surroundings, the new owners can sit in front of the television or simply stare out into the surrounding gardens . A breakfast bar separates the dining table and the kitchen. Book shelves cover the walls around the house . After a long day of writing, Mr Irving enjoys to cook in this spacious kitchen.

The Olympic heptathlon champion received threatening messages via Twitter last month, with one user writing he hoped Evans raped Ennis-Hill, after saying she would want her name removed from a stand at Bramall Lane if Evans returned. Ennis-Hill spoke out after United accepted a request from the Professional Footballers' Association to allow Evans to train with his former club following the striker's release from prison, midway through a five-year sentence. United later withdrew the offer. Athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill urged Sheffield United not to re-sign convicted rapist Ched Evans . In an interview with BBC Sport, Ennis-Hill said of the abuse: 'It was definitely a shock. It was not very nice to read them but unfortunately that's the world we live in. 'You kind of have to keep focused on who you are and what you believe in, and try not to read too much into it. 'You can't spend hours going through your Twitter feed and reading everything every single person says to you. You need to get on with your life.' Ennis-Hill was one of several high-profile figures to enter the debate over Evans after United initially said he would be allowed to train. TV presenter Charlie Webster, 1960s pop star Dave Berry and health adviser Lindsay Graham all stood down as club ambassadors during the row. 'I knew I was in a position where I was going to upset someone whether I said something or didn't,' Ennis-Hill said. 'With my stand at Sheffield United and the association I have with the club, I really just wanted to voice my opinion. Ennis-Hill, pictured at the Shard on Wednesday night, received plenty of Twitter abuse from supporters . 'It wasn't about putting pressure on the club or anything like that - it was just simply about how I felt. I think people can be rehabilitated and if they have served time in jail can go back into society, but I just feel that when you are in a really privileged position it's quite different.' Ennis-Hill, 28, is now focused on getting back into competitive shape after giving birth to her son Reggie in July, and she is hoping to defend her Olympic title in Rio in 2016. 'It's hard getting up when you have not had much sleep but I really want to have this last push in my career,' she said of her return to training.

A Canadian railway is suing the mother of man killed by one of its trains \u2013 giving the heartbroken woman until exactly two years to the day of the accident to answer the suit.Sharon Jobson, of Glencoe, Ontario, has until July 29 to answer a $500,000 lawsuit from CN Rail brought against the grieving mother for damages and train delays incurred through her 22-year-old son John Jobson\u2019s negligence despite the crossing still not having adequate signage and warnings, according to reports.\u2018We thought we had a happy ending. Lights and gates are going up in the next two weeks \u2014 they\u2019ve already been delivered . . .\u00a0 I think everyone thought it was a good ending to a tragic story. This is just really a shock to everyone,\u2019 Sharon Jobson told the Toronto Star. Dead: John Jobson, 22, died six days after his pickup truck was struck by a commuter train, now the railroad is suing his mother for damages . Despite Sharon Jobson, 50, persuading the rail operator to budget over $400,000 to install signs and warning gates at rail crossings, the one her son was killed at still has inadequate signage and no gates, yet the CN Rail felt it proper to serve her with the lawsuit since she is the executor of his estate, according to CTV.John Jobson is \u2018wholly responsible\u2019 for costs related to rail repair and a \u2018bottleneck of rail traffic,\u2019 according to a copy of the suit obtained by the Toronto Star. The suit goes on to say that Jobson failed to obey a stop sign and was traveling \u2018at an excessive rate of speed\u2019 over the rail crossing when his pickup truck was struck by a passenger train, the paper reported. John Jobson died six days later at a local hospital. \u2018He created a situation of danger . . . (and) had a history of failing to stop at this crossing,\u2019 the paper reported the suit said.Of the 116 passengers on-board the VIA train, six sustained minor injuries when the locomotive and all four train cars derailed after the collision, according to a report from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. Pay up: CN Rail says negligence caused the collision and that the $500,000 in repairs and inconveniences should be paid by his mother Sharon Jobson . Unsafe: The suit was brought against Sharon Jobson despite the crossing having inadequate signage at the time of the collision that has yet to be upgraded . The history of failing to stop at rail crossings alleged in the suit is an incident in which John Jobson had to drive into a ditch to avoid colliding with a Canadian Pacific Railway train at a separate crossing just north of where the collision occurred, according to the TSB report. Adequate signage and warnings were installed at the CP crossing shortly after the incident, the TSB report noted.Despite a train previously killing a driver in a 1998 collision at the same crossing where John Jobson\u2019s pickup truck was hit, CN Rail neglected to upgrade the crossing\u2019s warning systems, which the TSB said were \u2018situated too low,\u2019 to sufficiently warn drivers.Also a hindrance to John Jobson being aware of the oncoming train was the train horn\u2019s position \u2013 instead of being at the front of the locomotive, it was in the middle of the head car, making it harder to hear, according to the TSB report. Crushed: Sharon Jobson's son is dead because a train hit him, and now the railway wants her to pony up $400,000 . The devastated mother even declined last year to sue the railroad, saying it was never about the money.\u2018We were happy with getting some safety measures in place. We never were seeking anything financial,\u2019 she told the Star, adding \u2018I was hoping to have some peace with the lights and the safety measures in place but that won\u2019t be happening too soon.\u2019Both the railway and Sharon Jobson are declining to comment publicly on the suit, with Sharon Jobson only telling CTV \u2018I don\u2019t want to be doing this at this time.I just want to have a peaceful time.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sharon Jobson, whose son John died in a CN Rail collision, declined to sue the railway.

A set of unique photographs taken during the First World War by a British sailor shows the biggest manmade explosion in history . The images show the moment two warships collided into each another in December 1917, triggering an explosion which killed nearly 2,000 people . During the incident, the SS Mont-Blanc - a ship from France fully loaded with wartime explosives - collided with SS Imo from Norway . Experts say the blast was the largest manmade explosion prior to the development of nuclear weapons - with an equivalent force of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT. Amateur photographer Victor, who was based in Halifax in the Canadian state of Nova Scotia, was said to 'always had a camera around his neck' and was able to grab a series of shots of the original 'big bang'. The photos have now been found by his daughter Ann Foreman, 89, who discovered them among photo albums in a drawer. She had no idea a slice of history had been gathering dust in her home for nearly 100 years. Mrs Foreman, from Hayle in Cornwall, who served in the land army, will take them to the Imperial War Museum, London, next month to have the photos looked at. She said: 'My father was a great photographer. He always had a camera around his neck. He would take photos all the time. He never asked anyone to pose or anything. He just snapped away. 'It was just a coincidence that he was at the Halifax disaster. The actual explosion was a a massive amount of smoke.

'The Halifax Explosion' had an equivalent force of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT and left a a trail of destruction in its wake . The photos were taken by Royal Navy Lt Victor Magnus, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, - the young sailor 'always had a camera around his neck' 'He was very lucky to survive, especially as it destroyed the town. He took some photos on the shore and it looked like the London Blitz. 'The whole situation of finding the photos has made it very real. I'm just so proud of him. He never talked about this and this is the first time seeing them. It's extraordinary.' After the war, Victor went back to his job as a Marine Underwriter in Essex, before serving in the home guard during the Second World War. Although later leaving the role to become an apple farmer, he always loved the sea and was the Commodore of Essex Yacht Club. He was married for his whole life, had three children and six grandchildren, and died in 1969. The photos have now been found by his daughter Ann Foreman, 89, from Hayle, Cornwall, who discovered them among photo albums . The explosion, at 9.04am on Thursday December 6, 1917, happened in the the Narrows, a strait connecting the upper Halifax Harbour to Bedford Basin. A fire on board the French ship then ignited her explosive cargo causing a cataclysmic explosion that devastated the Richmond District of Halifax. It was so powerful it almost wiped out the entire town and around 2,000 people were killed by debris, fires, and collapsed buildings and more than 9,000 injured. 1.

SS Mont Blanc was described as a huge 'floating bomb' because of her formidable cargo. There were more than 2,000 tonnes of picric acid, 200 tonnes of TNT, 56 tonnes of gun cotton and 223 tonnes of motor fuel on board. Records show the ship exploded and disintegrated in seconds. Altogether 3.8 sq km (1.5 sq miles) of Halifax was flattened in an instant and more than 1,900 people perished. The SS Mont Blanc was completely destroyed, with its hull launched 1,000ft in the air, while the SS Imo survived and returned to service in 1918. As the ships collided, Lt Montague was on the shore with his camera in hand, snapping the event. His daughter is expected to visit the Imperial War Museum on December 2, where an expert will talk through the photos with her. Dr Robb Robinson, a lecturer in Maritime History at Hull University, said: 'It was 1917 and the Germans had just unleashed submarine warfare, causing massive problems for the allies. There was a big push by the Germans to win the war. 'To try and stop this, the allies launched a convoy system with ships staying sailing close to each other. This left them vulnerable to collision. 'Secondly, so many ships had been sunk that ships that weren't right for the job were being used. 'Thirdly, they were drawing increasingly on Canada and the USA for ammunition, so ships were being filled with ammunition before sailing over. 'It lead to the most devastating explosion there had every been at the time. Before Hiroshima, every explosion was judged on how it compared to Halifax. 'This explosion was a precursor of things to come throughout the century.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Victor Magnus' photos capture the 'Halifax Explosion', caused by the collision of SS Mont-Blanc, loaded with over 2,000 tonnes of explosives, and SS Imo.

Ms Rajah suffers an extremely rare form of cancer that is likely to kill her, reported Channel 9's A Current Affair. 'I may not be around past Christmas and expected case is a couple of years,' she said. Scroll down for video . Yasmin Rajah and her partner Ryan Price have two young sons Josiah (left) and Jazz (right) At just 29, Ms Rajah could have just months to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of cancer . After going to a doctor believing she had a broken rib in July, tests revealed a cancerous tumour about the size of a grapefruit and squashing her heart. Diagnosed with stage 3 cancer, mature teratoma with a malignant adenocarcinoma differentiation, it has since spread to her bones and spine, reducing her chance of survival to just five per cent despite the tumour being removed from her right lung through open heart surgery. The form of cancer is so rare that little research has been done on it. After learning she had the disease, Ms Rajah said her first concern was her family - partner Ryan Price and their sons Jazz, eight, and five-year-old Josiah. The couple have been together for eight years and are now planning to marry thanks to the generosity of the community . Ms Rajah said her first concern after being diagnosed with the cancer was her family, including sons Jazz (left) and Josiah (right) Jazz said he hoped his mum could stay clam, be strong and get rid of the cancer as quick as a 'flash'. 'We did tell the boys that mummy was going to beat cancer and going to live, but things have changed,' Yasmin said. Her partner Ryan described Ms Rajah's condition as a sinking boat. 'There's a hole in it and no matter how much water you scope out, it's not helping - it just sinks,' he said. 'I love her with cancer, I love her without cancer, I love her with hair, I love her without hair.' Mr Price said he loves his partner with or without her cancer . While the couple initially told their sons Ms Rajah would beat cancer, her condition has since worsened . The couple met eight years ago in a bar where Ms Rajah performed and Mr Price said as soon as he saw her, he hoped she would talk to him and they are now planning on getting married. 'It means a lot to be a complete family unit,' Ms Rajah said, regardless of whether a marriage certificate is just a piece of paper to some people. Ms Rajah previously gave her first engagement ring to a minister who lost his home in a flood because she had no money to offer. In in act of complete kindness, Mr Price contacted Brisbane radio station B105, which is helping the couple get married with businesses and the public donating wedding rings, a wedding dress, venue hire, hair, make-up, catering and a bucks and hens night. A Brisbane radio station is helping the couple get married after Mr Price informed them about his partner's condition .

The company has put $3,000 into the fund, which aims to raise $30,000 by the end of the month. 'This is the hardest thing I know I'll ever have to go through in my entire life,' Mr Price said.

UPDATED: . 05:03 EST, 3 July 2012 . A . used-car salesman has been jailed for life for murdering his estranged wife, . their young son and his father-in-law by setting fire to their family . home after his marriage collapsed. Danai . Muhammadi, 24, was fuelled by 'spite, anger and resentment' when he . killed Melissa Crook, 20, and their 15-month-old son Noah by torching . the house in Chatham Hill, Chatham, Kent. Melissa\u2019s father Mark Crook, 49, was left critically ill with severe . burns in hospital following the fire just before 2.30am on September 10 . last year and he died six days later. Judge Mr Justice Sweeney, sentencing at Maidstone Crown Court, told Iraqi-born Muhammadi that he will spend at least 38 years behind bars before being eligible for parole. Happier times: Melissa Crook and her future killer Danai Muhammadi on their wedding day . The court heard how Muhammadi . and his friend, bouncer Farhad Mahmud, 35, squirted petrol through the . letter box using a garden spray container, leading to fire breaking out . at the base of the stairs. The location of the fire cut off any reasonable means of escape for the family who were asleep upstairs as the blaze took hold. As . smoke and flames filled the three-bedroom terraced house, Melissa . collapsed in an upstairs bedroom and was found dead by firefighters . lying by her son who was wrapped in a quilt. Amid . the chaos, her brother Bohdan jumped out of a front bedroom window, . causing fractures to his feet and hands. He then tried to get back . inside to reach his mother, Amanda, who eventually managed to escape. Her . husband, Mark Crook, meanwhile, tried to flee the building by following . his wife out of an upstairs window on to a flat roof outside. But . 26-stone Mr Crook got stuck in the window frame just as a fireball blew . the windows out. He . suffered 80 per cent burns and was taken to a specialist burns unit in . East Grinstead, West Sussex, where he never regained consciousness in . the intensive care unit. He died six days later. Mahmud was also found guilty of three counts . of murder. Muhammadi and Mahmud were both also found guilty of two counts of attempted murder. Muhammadi\u2019s . new girlfriend, jobless Emma Smith, 21, was cleared of three counts of . murder and two counts of attempted murder but convicted of three counts . of manslaughter after a six-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court. The judge said that while she was not the principal figure, she was a 'joint perpetrator in the common venture to burn the house'. Scene of tragedy: The Crook family home in Chatham, Kent, was left gutted after the blaze . Escape: Melissa's brother Bohdan Crook (left) broke his feet and hands when he jumped from the burning house while her mother Amanda watched in horror as her husband burned after becoming stuck in the window . Judge Sweeney said the actions of Muhammadi 'can truly be described as pure, selfish wickedness' - adding that Melissa Crook and Noah 's last moments, trapped by the flames, must have been 'of abject terror. He said: 'No-one who heard the evidence in this case will ever forget Mrs Crook\u2019s description of how, as he tried to escape, her husband became stuck in the bedroom window and how, unable to extricate himself, she had to stand and watch as his lower half was burned. 'It\u2019s no thanks to you two that Amanda Crook and Bohdan Crook escaped the fate that you intended for them. 'Each suffered significant injuries, the effects - whether physical or mental - they are still clearly suffering from today.' Mr Justice Sweeney acknowledged that Muhammadi was the 'principal offender', adding: 'The enterprise was all your idea and you drove it forward to its conclusion.' He said that Mahmud\u2019s actions were borne out of 'misguided friendship' with Muhammadi and his expectation of significant financial gain from him. Mahmud was sentenced to life with a minimum term of 34 years prison before being eligible for parole. Muhammadi's girlfriend Smith showed no emotion as she was jailed for 14 years. The couple's marriage collapsed after six months amid arguments and emotional conflict involving their son . The judge told her: 'You joined the enterprise because you were the girlfriend of Danai Muhammadi. 'It was an on-off relationship in which, as I have already said when passing his sentence, he used you to get Melissa back.' He added that like both Muhammadi and Mahmud, Smith had shown not 'a spark of genuine remorse' for her actions. In the weeks before the fire, the court heart how Melissa Crook's relationships with Muhammadi and Smith deteriorated. Smith . had started a relationship with Mrs Crook\u2019s estranged husband, Danai . Muhammadi, and in four-letter text message exchanges she taunted Melissa . about their 'great life together'. Smith also mocked Mrs Crook . about her size, for being 'boring' in the bedroom and added: 'Enjoy your . life with no husband, no house... no money you gold-digger.' Amanda Crook, 50, said she felt 'sick' when she learned Danai Muhammadi was suspected of starting the . fire that killed three generations of her family. Mrs . Crook escaped the burning building in Chatham, Kent, along with her . 22-year-old son Bohdan - Melissa\u2019s brother - but both said the end of . the court case would not bring them closure. She said: 'We weren\u2019t . just anyone, we were family, and the fact he (Muhammadi) did it to his . wife and his own child and his father-in-law.

The 68-year-old said he did not have a predatory nature with women, but admitted he did \u2018hug a lot of girls\u2019. \u2018If I like someone I will hug them and give them a kiss because the whole world needs that,\u2019 he told the court. \u2018Perhaps hugging is something which can be misconstrued by some people or if people are looking for an excuse they can say \u201che touched us\u201d. I did hug a lot of girls. \u2018But nowadays you can\u2019t do that apparently\u2009\u2026\u2009So it is an unfortunate trait I suppose.\u2019 Travis described his colourful career as a \u2018big name\u2019 DJ at Radio 1 \u2013 but told Southwark Crown Court he could not do what he wanted. Travis spoke of his passion for photography and admitted he has taken pictures of naked and semi-naked women for a book he published. But he insisted that the pictures were not \u2018tacky\u2019 and said he did not use his hobby to prey on women. \u2018I love women,\u2019 he told the jury. \u2018I think they are wonderful.\u2019 He added: \u2018Women just have such fabulous shapes and I wanted to utilise those shapes.\u2019 Among the allegations against him, Travis is accused of\u00a0 sneaking into a Radio 4 studio and groping a presenter as she introduced Woman\u2019s Hour live on air in the early 1980s. Denying the attack, he said: \u2018I would be at a bit of a loose end understanding it to be quite honest with you.\u2019 He said he would have been hauled before a station boss if he had dared to interrupt a Radio 4 programme. On the stand: A sketch of Travis giving evidence in his own defence at the court today . On trial: The veteran former DJ denies assaulting 11 alleged victims over a period of more than three decades . \u2018I agree I was a big name in Radio 1, but there were quite a few big names. You did not do what you wanted at the BBC,\u2019 he said. Years later he met the woman at a party where he took a photograph of her. He . said: \u2018Everything seemed to be fine. That was a serious thing that in . her mind had happened. Why would she suddenly be posing and smiling for . me and for the camera? \u2018I . thought she was great, I thought she was fabulous, a really nice lady. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t get this. On the rare occasions I met her, I thought . she was superb.\u2019 Denial: Travis said that although he loves women's 'shapes' he is not a sexual predator . Travis, . who is being tried under his real name of Dave Patrick Griffin, was also . questioned over claims he pushed his hand up the skirt of a newsreader . while he was working for Classic Gold radio station in the early 2000s. \u2018This is not something you would do if you are a normal human being,\u2019 the DJ told the court. \u2018It\u2019s astonishing because I even thought, and I said to police, that she was wearing trousers.\u2019 When . asked about whether it had ever been suggested he had a reputation for . being a \u2018sexual predator\u2019 at the station, he said: \u2018No, no one said a . thing about it. \u2018You can\u2019t sexually assault a woman and expect people would not say anything.

Travis, . of Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, denies 13 counts of indecent assault . dating back to between 1976 and 2003, and one count of sexual assault in . 2008. The trial continues. Dave Lee Travis cried himself to sleep after being accused of assaulting women and said the allegations had ruined his life and career, a court heard today. The veteran DJ claimed he had been 'screwed backwards' by the claims, telling police his wife Marianne was ill with breast cancer at the time they emerged. He also said he had been forced to sell his home to fight the allegations, which he said had been made up by his accusers in a bid to 'make money'. Today jurors heard extracts from a police interview with Travis on September 18 last year, 10 months after he was first arrested. Couple: Travis said that his wife Marianne, right, was suffering from breast cancer at the time the allegations first surface . 'Mr Travis said that for 10 months he . had lost his money, work, his health, he has had back and knee . operations and had suffered stress,' said junior prosecutor Teresa Hay. 'Worse . still, his wife had suffered breast cancer. She was through it now but . stress is bad for someone who is going through that. 'This . was costing him his job, his living and everything he has built up over . 50 years. For him these allegations don't stand up. He and his wife had . suffered badly.' He said his accuser was 'out to make money' and asked: 'Why wait 20 years until it comes out in one-sided press coverage?' 'This is just someone else who can smell money and is jumping into the game to see what they can get out of it,' he told police. Ms Hay said Travis told police that 'he has been screwed . backwards - he is selling his house to pay for solicitors and . barristers. 'People might think he is a millionaire but his bank account is non-existent. 'His . life has changed for the worse and he is full of anger. Even if he is . acquitted he still won't be free. He has cried at night.' Home: Travis told police he had been forced to sell his house in Buckinghamshire, pictured, to pay his legal bills . The . jury heard that Travis was questioned in relation to allegations that . he groped a woman while dancing the Lambada at two British Airways . parties in the early 1990s. He . told police he would provide musical entertainment at such parties, . often wearing fancy dress, but could not remember those events in . particular. Asked about claims that he had told . the woman she had 'won the keys to his room', he claimed it was not the . type of thing he would say. He went on: 'It is just because she saw a picture of me in the paper next to Jimmy Savile. It is nonsense.' Travis . also told police that he had 'great sympathy' with rape victims and had . been involved in attempts to stop it in his work for children's . charities. 'But he didn't see the similarity between this and grabbing a girl's bum in a dance,' Ms Hay said. The . court has previously heard claims that Travis molested a teenager at a . Showaddywaddy concert and assaulted a woman in the BBC studio while . broadcasting his Radio 1 show. He . is also accused of attacking a theatre worker in his dressing room . while appearing in panto, stopping only when one of the Chuckle Brothers . walked past. Dave . Lee Travis groped a journalist's bottom while they were playing a . flight simulator game on his computer, a court heard today. The . German woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was visiting his . home in Buckinghamshire to interview him about Beat Club, a TV show . which he once presented. She . told jurors she was 'embarrassed and taken aback' by the DJ's 'sleazy' behaviour during the alleged incident in August 2005, which followed a . 90-minute interview. Travis invited the woman to play his favourite game and stood behind her as she began to play, the court heard. 'That's when he put his hand on a . shoulder, ran it down my back and rested it on the left cheek of my . bum,' she said. 'It was an extremely uncomfortable moment. 'I was completely taken aback, it was just unexpected. I felt it was sleazy, there was absolutely no option for me than to move. 'I was rather embarrassed and I was embarrassed for him about this kind of behaviour, it was just so inappropriate.' Star: The claims against Travis date back to the height of his fame as a DJ and presenter in the 1970s . The reporter said that after the incident she 'pretended it didn't happen', while Travis appeared 'sheepish'. She asked Travis to give her a lift to the local train station, where she took a photograph of the pair together. 'I . did feel it was a really embarrassing situation and it was, I guess an . attempt to make light of the situation,' the woman told the court. She said that the DJ 'pulled her towards him and we ended up standing cheek to cheek', adding: 'That's not the photograph I wanted. 'I have interviewed many, many famous people in my journalistic career and most of the time they are pleasant people. 'My only explanation was that he must have felt really sheepish about what happened. 'I think the situation was so awkward, it was obvious this elderly gentleman who I had never heard of before completely crossed the line. It must have been embarrassing for him.' The alleged victim confided in her partner but did not complain about the incident, saying 'it would have been very difficult' to lodge an official complaint. 'For me the situation was so embarrassing, it was so strange, I didn't feel I wanted to complain to someone,' she said. 'I sometimes thought in retrospect it would have been the smarter or braver thing to do at the time.' She eventually came forward after hearing of Travis' arrest in November 2012.

In a televised address carried by Hezbollah's station al Manar, Hassan Nasrallah said those regimes had lost the support and respect of their own people. Hezbollah -- a Shi'ite movement -- has often criticized the largely Sunni-led governments in the Arab world. But Nasrallah's language Monday came close to promoting their overthrow. The Hezbollah leader said he had not spoken before about the situation in Egypt because he did not want to be accused of meddling in Egypt's affairs. In a taunting reference to the Mubarak government's claim that Hezbollah has been active in Egypt, Nasrallah said the militia's friends and supporters there had recommended it should not speak up about the situation. Nasrallah's comments come as the people of Lebanon wait anxiously for the formation of a new government. The Cabinet led by Saad Hariri was brought down last month, and Hezbollah has emerged as the most powerful force in a possible new government. At the same time, tension is growing over the unveiling of indictments said to connect members of Hezbollah with the assassination of Rafik Hariri, Saad's father, in 2005. Hezbollah has turned on the U.N. Special Tribunal on Lebanon that is investigating the assassination, describing it as a tool of Israel and the United States. Saad Hariri says his party won't join the new government without guarantees it will respect indictments handed down by the tribunal. Positions are hardening ahead of commemorations of the sixth anniversary of Rafik Hariri's death on February 14. The daunting task of reconciliation has fallen to Najib Mikati -- a billionaire Sunni businessman involved in telecommunications, construction and other businesses. He has said he wants to form a national unity government -- and is seeking to accommodate Sunnis, Shi'ites and Christians in government as he negotiates the bewildering alliances between Lebanon's many parties. Some Lebanese politicians, notably the veteran Nabih Berri, a Shiite, are talking optimistically about a new government being formed within a week. Others foresee a much longer period of wrangling just as Lebanon awaits the publication of the tribunal's indictments, which for now are sealed. Lebanon's old divisions -- Christian against Sunni against Shiite -- are now more complex. Some Christian families, notably the Gemayels and their Kataeb party, are allied with the Sunni Hariri's party and want to see Hezbollah's wings clipped. Besides its political strength, Hezbollah's militia numbers thousands of well-trained fighters and tens of thousands of rockets prepared for war with Israel. But another prominent Christian, Michel Aoun, is allied with the Shiite Hezbollah. And Walid Jumblatt, the leader of the minority Druze community, has deserted Hariri for the pro-Syrian Hezbollah, even though Jumblat's father was killed by the Syrians. Aoun was brutally honest about his choice: \"We have the choice of stability at the price of justice by going with Hezbollah.\" In other words, the publication of the indictments and any attempt to follow through with arrests would only destabilize Lebanon. Many view Lebanon as an emerging battleground between Iran and Syria on the one hand and pro-Western forces on the other."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nasrallah criticized Arab regimes for their U.S. and Israel alliances, attributing their loss of public support to these alliances.

In one shocking comment, an angry Mr Karroum told journalist Lisa Goddard: 'I'm praying to the Lord every day, Tony Abbott, please Lord, let him lose one of his daughter, either in sickness or in accident or something, please Lord.' 'The Australian government is the mother and father of her, they are the ones who control everything in this country,' Mr Karroum told A Current Affair.

In an interview on Channel Nine's A Current Affair program, a grieving Mohamed Karroum says the Australian government has his daughter's blood on its hands .

The pair met and married in 2013, before Ali travelled to fight with al-Qaeda in Syria. After the Australian government stopped Amira from trying to leave the country on two occasions, she told family she was going to meet Ali for a vacation in Copenhagen. Her body was found shot and dismembered beside her husband's   in a house in Aleppo, just three weeks after she left Australia. Mohammed Karroum recalled the last message his daughter sent him shortly before her death. 'Please Dad, pray to Allah and ask him to forgive you for the days, for the years you have not prayed for him, death is around the corner Dad. I love you,' he recalled. He says he 'just can't believe' his daughter became an al-Qaeda fighter. Mohamed Karroum says Yusef Ali, a known extremist, 'poisoned' his daughter's mind . One of the posts from Amira's Facebook page, where she said she worked as a 'Slave of Allah' Mohamed Karroum believes Ali was a trained al-Qaeda killer who was known to Australian authorities.

Outraged conservationists have objected to the Tasmanian governments bold new plans which would see the 'wilderness' title removed from the state's Wilderness World Heritage area label . It further claims that the management of the region for wilderness values is a 'denial of their rights to access country and conduct cultural practices.' Vica Bayley, the Wilderness Society's Tasmanian campaign manager labelled the statement an 'extremely manipulative and deceptive argument', as the Tasmanian government had only recently expanded four wheel drive tracks over sacred Aboriginal middens in the north-west of the area. Tasmania's Liberal government provided $300,000 for the controversial development, which would see 90 kilometers of track upgraded and reopened, reported The ABC. The move was met with outrage by the Aboriginal community, as the area was home to countless rock engravings, middens, and hut depressions. 'This is completely tourism and development driven. If this is an example of 'sensitive development' then the community can have zero confidence in the plan,' he said.

'The draft plan is about achieving balanced outcomes that are genuinely respectful of cultural and natural values, while at the same time recognising that the TWWHA is an area to be used, celebrated and shared with the world,' Mr Groom said.

Ms McStein, who has become a full-time mother, is currently preparing for her hysterectomy which will be carried out in the next 12 months, and spends her free time raising awareness for endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common condition in which small pieces of the womb lining are found outside the womb - they can be found in the fallopian tubes, ovaries, bladder or bowel. The condition affects about two million women in the UK and most of them are diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 40. It is a chronic condition that causes painful and heavy periods. It can also lead to a lack of energy and fertility problems as well as pain during sex and bleeding between periods. Endometriosis symptoms can often be managed with painkillers or hormone treatments but surgery is sometimes required. Pregnancy can reduce the symptoms but they often return once the menstrual cycle returns to normal. One of the main complications of endometriosis is infertility. In severe cases, a hysterectomy can be required to treat the condition. However,the condition can return even after the operation. To have the best chance of curing the condition, the ovaries need to be removed as well."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Amy McStein was diagnosed with severe endometriosis at 19, a condition causing painful periods and potential infertility.

Former Formula One legend Irvine, 48, pulled a glass on the son of the former mayor of Milan, and left him with visible injuries over his eye, the court ruled. He was found guilty of assault and battery. The target of his attack, Gabriele Moratti, a renowned playboy, was also found guilty for assault and battery, having launched a hail of punches at Irvine, and was also handed a sentence of six months. Under the Italian justice system both are unlikely to ever see the inside of a jail cell as they are automatically entitled to two appeals. In any case the statute of limitations on the crimes expires in 2015, after which the case will be dropped, unless all appeals have been heard. Punched: Millionaire racing driver Eddie Irvine has been sentenced to . six months in prison for a nightclub brawl in Milan with Gabriele Moratti, the son of a former mayor of the Italian city . The quarrel began over a text message sent by the former Ferrari driver to an ex girlfriend of Moratti, named Giorgia, witnesses told the court in Milan. When Moratti entered the VIP area of Milan\u2019s Hollywood nightclub, and came across eternal bachelor Irvine talking to the girl he had recently broken up with, he attacked him, punching him three times, a lawyer for Irvine told the court. The Formula One champion, who now runs a property company and a shipping business, claimed he was hit repeatedly from behind by Mr Moratti causing him to black out. Giving evidence at an earlier hearing, the multi-millionaire racing driver said he believed Moratti \u2018was jealous because I sometimes took his ex girlfriend out. He told the court: \u2018I had arrived at the club at about midnight and sat at a table in the VIP area. I was drinking a vodka lemonade and while I was sitting on the sofa talking to Giorgia I was struck with two or three punches by Moratti. I lost my balance and I fell. Someone tried to stop Moratti. I didn\u2019t look back because I was afraid he would hit me in the face.\u2019 Following the brawl, Irvine received . threatening phone calls from one of Moratti\u2019s associates in his Milan . hotel room, he told the court.

In April of last year, he was fined \u20ac49,000 after falling foul of planning regulations, when he converted a warehouse in the Milanese suburbs into his personal Batman cave.

The trip includes several fundraisers for his re-election bid. During a wide-ranging interview, Obama criticized Washington's harsh political climate, telling Leno that \"the things that folks across the country are most fed up with, whether you are a Democrat, Republican, (or) independent, is putting party ahead of country or putting the next election ahead of the next generation.\" The two men discussed several foreign policy topics, including the situation in Libya and the impending withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq. Regarding Libya, Leno asked the president for his reaction to the death of longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi. \"This is somebody who for 40 years has terrorized his country and supported terrorism,\" Obama said. Gadhafi \"had an opportunity during the Arab Spring to finally let loose of his grip on power and to peacefully transition into democracy. We gave him ample opportunity, and he wouldn't do it.\" Obama said Gadhafi's demise sent \"a strong message around the world to dictators\" that \"people long to be free,\" and that \"universal rights\" and aspirations should be respected. The bloodied Gadhafi's televised jostling with his captors was not something Americans \"should relish,\" the president said . \"There was a reason after (Osama) bin Laden was killed, for example, we didn't release the photograph,\" the president said. \"I think that there's a certain decorum with which you treat the dead -- even if it's somebody who has done terrible things.\" The president hit back at GOP critics of the American role in the NATO-led Libya campaign, insisting that the United States did not, as many have claimed, \"lead from behind.\" \"We lead from the front,\" Obama asserted, highlighting the U.S. role in pushing a U.N. resolution backing NATO's intervention, as well as the U.S. military's role in establishing a no-fly zone over Libya. \"The difference here is we were able to organize the international community,\" Obama said. \"There was never this sense that somehow we were unilaterally making a decision to take out somebody. Rather, it was the world community.\" The Libya operation \"is a recipe for success in the future,\" the president declared. Obama also defended his choice to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of the year -- a decision blasted by GOP critics concerned the move will imperil U.S. gains in the region. \"I don't know exactly how they are thinking about it,\" Obama said. \"We've been in there for years, over 4,000 young men and women killed, tens of thousands injured, some of them for life, (and) spent close to $1 trillion on this operation. I think the vast majority of the American people feel as if it is time to bring this war to a close, particularly because we still have ... work to do in Afghanistan.\" The president noted the importance of the recent death of Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born cleric killed in Yemen by a U.S. drone strike. Al-Awlaki played a critical role with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, heading up external operations and focusing on attacking the United States, officials said. Al-Awlaki was \"probably the most important al Qaeda threat that was out there after bin Laden was taken out,\" Obama said. \"It was important that working with the enemies, we were able to remove him from the field.\" Turning closer to home, Obama had strong praise for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- his toughest competitor for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. \"I'm really proud of her,\" Obama said. \"It really wasn't that difficult\" to come together after the campaign. \"The truth is Hillary and I agree on the vast majority of issues.\" Obama appeared to dismiss rumors of a possible job swap between Clinton and Vice President Joe Biden in 2012, telling Leno that \"they are doing great where they are.\" The president expressed a degree of sympathy for the Occupy Wall Street movement, noting that \"people are frustrated, and that frustration has expressed itself in a lot of different ways\" -- including both Occupy Wall Street and the tea party. As a huge basketball fan, the president called the current NBA lockout \"heartbreaking.\" \"We should be able to figure out how to split a $9 billion dollar pot so that our fans, who are allowing us to make all of this money, can actually have a good season,\" he said. Asked about his health and personal habits, Obama told Leno that he has \"definitively\" quit smoking, and remains \"big on exercise.\" The president said he works out on a regular basis with first lady Michelle Obama in a small White House gym. \"It's embarrassing sometimes,\" the president said. \"She'll get up there a half an hour earlier than me. She will have already run 10 miles or something ... (when I'm) staggering up to the gym.\" Noting the first lady's highly publicized campaign for fitness and healthier eating habits, Obama said his wife actually does enjoy more unhealthy cuisine on occasion. \"She loves french fries. She loves pizza. She loves chicken. Her point is just in moderation,\" Obama told Leno. As for the upcoming Halloween holiday, the president said his wife generally hands out fruit and raisins. The president said he told his wife that \"the White House is going to get egged if this keeps up.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "On 'The Tonight Show', President Obama discussed Gadhafi's death, the U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq, his re-election bid, the death of Anwar al-Awlaki, and the NBA lockout.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\n(CNN) -- A few months before her second birthday, a small bump about the size of a pimple appeared on Audriana Willman's right leg. Her parents, Andrew and Chelsea, noticed the boil in the evening, as they prepared their daughter for bed. \"We had already been through this three other times, so we weren't too worried,\" explains Chelsea, who says she had taken her daughter to a pediatrician on several occasions to treat skin infections. As they usually did when a little red circle with a white head appeared on their toddler's body, they popped it like a pimple and cleaned the area with antibacterial soap. But this time, that small pimple would turn into a major problem. \"By the next morning, it wasn't just a bump anymore. Her leg was red and extremely swollen, and she could hardly walk. She was in pain, and her fever had spiked to 103,\" her mother recalls. \"It went from minor to really, really bad overnight.\" By 10:30 that morning, they had rushed Audriana to their pediatrician in Oroville, California. She was hospitalized, and the Willmans learned their daughter had developed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, which is a type of staph bacterium that does not respond to commonly used antibiotic treatments. This type of infection has been a problem in hospital settings for many years, but starting around 2000, it began steadily making its way into the lives of otherwise healthy people, especially children, who are not typically at risk for the fast-moving bacteria. As children head back to school, epidemiologists are encouraging parents to be more aware of the drug-resistant strain of staph and how to protect their kids. MRSA infections on the rise . \"Everyone is at risk,\" said Dr. Patrick Romano, senior author of a new report that found the number of children hospitalized with MRSA infections, mostly acquired from within the community, has more than doubled since 2000. \"MRSA really started as a bacterium that was seen in hospitals among high-risk patients. But during the last decade, we saw it spread to the general population.\" \"The problem is that MRSA began to affect people who were perfectly healthy,\" adds Dr. Jaime Fergie, author of a 2005 study that concluded that infections in children had reached \"epidemic proportions.\" Mutations in the organism made it more virulent and easy to transmit, he says. \"We continue to see more severe, life-threatening infections affecting the blood, lungs, muscles and even bones of previously healthy children.\" In 2009, 71,900 children were hospitalized because of infections under the skin, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the CDC estimates there are approximately 10,800 deaths in the U.S. each year caused by staph, of which 5,500 are inked to MRSA. The problem became so widespread that in January, the Infectious Diseases Society of America called the condition a \"huge public health problem\" and published its first-ever guidelines for the treatment of MRSA in pediatric patients. Protecting your child from MRSA . \"We have to live with the fact that it's out there, all around us in the community. At this point, we expect a certain level of these infections,\" Romano says. \"Now, it's a matter of recognizing the early signs and treating it early when we see it.\" Audriana Willman spent three days in a hospital and recovered without serious complication from her MRSA infection. Her parents say their previous experience has made them more cognizant of every little bump on their daughter. And because their daughter is prone to skin infections, they are even more vigilant about hygiene in their household. \"We learned that the hard way, how quickly they can progress. The longer we can go without them, the better,\" her mother says. As children head back to school, pediatricians are encouraging parents to become educated about MRSA to ensure that if their child gets an infection, they catch it early, before symptoms become severe. Here are 5 things parents should know: . 1. The infection site can resemble a spider bite . \"Sometimes, parents mistake [a MRSA infection] for a spider bite because it is so intense and appears so suddenly,\" said Fergie, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Driscoll Children's Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas. \"If you haven't seen a spider, don't assume it's a spider bite. If you recognize a painful red spot with a little bit of pus, that's enough of a concern to go to a doctor,\" he recommends. To help you identify the infections, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has compiled several images to better visualize what MRSA infections may look like. 2. The infection may start like a pimple and advance rapidly . Dr. Jennifer Shu, an Atlanta pediatrician, says parents often don't realize how quickly the infection can progress. \"This is what shocks parents the most. Something that looked like a pimple is all of a sudden the size of a nickel,\" explains Shu, who says the bacteria can spread within a matter of hours. She once saw a patient who developed more than 30 skin boils in two to three days. 3. Transmission among young athletes is prevalent . According to the National Athletic Trainers' Association, skin diseases accounted for 56% of all infectious diseases in competitive sports from 1922 through 2005. Athletes tend to share things like equipment and towels, and children engaged in high-contacts sports inevitably receive cuts, bruises and scrapes, which act as potential entryways for serious bacterial infections. Last year, the association issued a position statement on skin disease among athletes warning that after a bacterial infection, they should not be allowed to return to a game until they complete a 72-hour course of antibiotic therapy and the infection has been completely drained. The CDC offers more prevention information and advice specifically for athletes on its website. 4. Treatment for MRSA not always the first option . Romano, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, Davis, says that when a child has an infection, doctors do not always start with a prescription that works against MRSA bacteria. In communities experiencing high MRSA rates, pediatricians may automatically default to medications that fight the bacteria, but they may choose not to in communities where there hasn't been an outbreak. If someone in your home or another child in your child's school recently had a MRSA infection, alert a doctor, as it may be worth asking up front for a broader-spectrum antibiotic. Pages 12-15 of the Infectious Diseases Society of America's Clinical Practice Guidelines list the treatment recommendations for adults and children based on their symptoms. Return to the pediatrician as soon as possible if within 48 hours you do not notice less swelling or redness, or if the infected area remains warm, Romano advises. 5. Bleach baths and proper cleaning can help prevent spread . If you have several children, and one of them has developed a MRSA infection, you want to keep the spread to a minimum. Experts say to keep the infected area covered with a bandage until it heals. The Willmans took the recommendation of an infectious disease specialist and gave their daughter a bleach bath using about a half-cup of bleach in about 13 gallons of water, a few times a week. There is the potential for skin irritation if the mixture is not diluted properly, so be sure to follow the guidelines outlined by the ISDA. You'll also want to clean surfaces that might come in contact with the infection. The Environmental Protection Agency offers a list of registered cleaning products that are effective against MRSA."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Audriana Willman, a toddler, contracted a severe MRSA infection, which has mutated to affect healthy individuals and is prevalent among athletes. The infection caused her leg to swell and her fever to spike. MRSA, once confined to hospitals, is increasingly affecting healthy individuals, especially children.

Treatment guidelines for MRSA have been published and prevention measures, including hygiene practices, are recommended."}]}

Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller were freed from the reclusive communist state on Saturday following a secret mission by the top U.S. intelligence official. Last night, the pair landed at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state about midnight ET (9pm local time). Scroll down for video . Ecstatic: Kenneth Bae's mother ran over to her son at a Washington air base on Saturday two years after he was captured in North Korea and sentenced to 15 years behind bars for\u00a0alleged anti-government activities . Emotional embrace: Matthew Miller, 24, beamed as his mother rushed over to the plane to hug him . Bae, who was jailed in 2012 for alleged anti-government activities, was the first to step off the plane emblazoned with stars and stripes and onto the tarmac into the arms of his family members. The Korean-American missionary from Lynnwood, Washington, laughed and beamed as he hugged his mother who ran over to him. He was followed by California-born Miller, 24, who\u00a0was serving a six-year jail term on charges of espionage, after he allegedly ripped his tourist visa at Pyongyang's airport in April and demanded asylum. With a shaved head, Miller looked happy but subdued as he walked down the steps and into his beaming mother's arms. His father wrapped an arm over his shoulder and took one of Miller's two small bags to carry. North Korea said Miller had wanted to experience prison life so that he could secretly investigate North Korea's human rights situation. While Miller went home with his family, Bae and his sister Terri Chung address a press conference. Freed: Bae was freed along with Miller after a lengthy intelligence operation by the top US official . Family: He was joined by his children, sister and brother-in-law based in Washington . 'I've grown': Bae told reporters he has learned a lot in his two years of hard labor at his private prison . Bae's family have thanked President Obama for not abandoning their relative . Bae thanked President Barack Obama and the many people who supported him. He also thanked the North Korean government for releasing him, and said 'it's been an amazing two years, I learned a lot.' He started his speech by saying: 'I just want to say thank you all for supporiting me and standing by me in this time and it's been just [an] amazing blessing to see so many people being involved getting me released in the last two years - not to mention the thousands of people praying for me. 'I just want to thank you for lifting me up and not forgetting me, not forgetting the people of North Korea as well.' 'This has been a tremendously difficult time for my family.

I learned a lot, I grew a lot lost, a lot of weight - in a good way - and I'm standing strong.'

Obama tabled the mission last week and it was approved by Congress, which sent intelligence official James Clapper to North Korea with a presidential letter. Bae and Miller were the last US nationals held by the dictatorship following the release last month of Jeffrey Fowle, an Ohio resident detained for nearly six months.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\n(CNN) -- The Danish exception to the history of the Holocaust sheds new light on the relation between the Third Reich and the countries it occupied. It is of particular interest to compare the Danish, Norwegian and Dutch experiences, because the three countries shared many similarities before the war and because the Nazi leadership saw them through the same prism. Despite this, the fate of the Jews in the three countries was very different. The armed resistance of Norway and the Netherlands led the Nazis to take control not only of their territories but of their entire societies. High-ranking German officials were sent to oversee the administration of Norway and the Netherlands, and local Nazis were installed in powerful positions throughout their civil administration. In sharp contrast, elected Danish politicians remained in control until the end of August 1943 and no Danish Nazis were allowed to be part of the Danish administration. This made it possible for the Danish authorities to reject the rationale for any measure to be taken against the Danish Jews. Indeed, the Danish government insisted that no Jewish problem existed in Denmark and that therefore no solution was called for. This attitude provoked a surprising reaction on the part of the Nazi leadership which not only hesitated and postponed the measures that were put in place elsewhere, but also softened the blow when finally, on October 1, 1943, the raid against the Danish Jews was executed. The Germans anticipated the popular Danish reaction in defense of their countrymen and sought to downplay the raid in order not to stir up too much trouble in the occupied country. The Danish opposition to the action caused the Nazis to hesitate and at the same time stimulated a consideration in Berlin of whether the action against the Danish Jews was worth the price? The continuation of \"Model-Protectorate Denmark\" with provisions of foodstuffs to Germany proved to be more important to the Nazi leaders than deporting and killing the Danish Jews. It is hard to conclude that something similar could have been achieved elsewhere under different conditions. But it is clear that the resistance of the Danes towards discrimination and persecution of their Jewish countrymen made it possible for the Danish Jews to escape. This unique story begs the question whether the same would be true today? Would Danes -- or for that matter any other people -- in a comparable situation rise up and act spontaneously to rescue their countrymen, even at the risk of their own safety? The question goes to the heart of one of the most intense discussions of modern democracies: who are \"we\" and who belongs to our society? What does it take to be British -- or Danish, or for that matter German? And who, living in Britain or in Denmark, are not seen as part of the national \"us\"? These questions find no easy answers. And yet, the history of the escape of the Danish Jews shows to us the critical importance of the answers. We have no reason to believe that Danes or other Europeans would not today act on their own initiative to help their countrymen at peril. But it may be less obvious who would in that case be considered countrymen. Whom do we see as part of society and thus under the protection of the communality? And whom do we see as strangers living among us? In the case of Denmark in the 1940s, the inclusion not only related to the well-established Jewish families who had been part of Danish society for centuries. It also included the more recently arrived \"Russian Jews\" who were first generation immigrants, and, perhaps more surprisingly, the not insignificant number of stateless Jews, mostly German refugees on the run from Nazi persecution. This group did not belong to Danish society in any trivial sense and they did not speak Danish. Most of them had been in the country only shortly, and many had no, if any, personal relation to Denmark. Yet, they were rescued, because most Danes at the time saw the Nazi assault against them as a violation of the sense of justice on which their nation was built. Therefore, coming to their rescue was considered a national duty, an act of patriotism. The rationale was neither abstract nor sophisticated. It was a widely shared sense that an injustice was being committed and that letting it pass without attempting to stop it would eventually corrupt the entire society. This sense is what society is about, today just as much as at the time of the escape of the Danish Jews. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bo Lidegaard."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Denmark's unique Holocaust experience, marked by its 'Model-Protectorate' status, Danish resistance, the rescue of stateless Jews, and a sense of national duty, reveals the Third Reich's complex approach to occupied territories. Unlike Norway and the Netherlands, Denmark's Jewish population, including stateless Jews, was spared due to political control, rejection of anti-Jewish measures, and national duty. This resistance led to Nazi hesitation and a softened October 1943 raid, prioritizing Denmark's food provisions to Germany over Jewish deportation."}]}

A study by financial experts Forbes found that Real Madrid's value now stands at $3.3 billion, knocking the English Premier League champions elect off the top of the list for the first time since the study began in 2004. Confounding the increasingly difficult economic conditions in Spain, Real, managed by Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho, have increased revenues to $650 million. Their operating income of $134 million is second only to the $227 million amassed by the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, which is the highest of all sports teams. Manchester United, on the brink of securing a record 20th English top flight title, increased their value by 42% to $3.17 billion, according to Forbes. Despite dropping to second behind Real, United have boosted revenues with a share issue and by signing bumper sponsorship deals. Their seven-year shirt sponsorship deal with U.S. car giant Chevrolet is worth $559 million while an eight-year agreement with insurance firm Aon is thought to be worth $230 million. All England's top flight clubs have been boosted by an increase in television revenue with the combined domestic and overseas rights having the potential to top $6 billion, Forbes say. Real's arch rivals Barcelona are third on the list with a value of $2.6 billion, English club Arsenal lie fourth on $1.32 billion while German champions Bayern Munich sit fifth on $1.3 billion. The top 20 clubs, all but one of which are European, are worth an average of $968 million, which is up 26% on last year. David Beckham, who now plays for French club Paris Saint-Germain, is again the best-paid soccer star with earnings of $50.6 million while Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo is second on $43.5m. Barcelona's Lionel Messi is third on $40.3m. Forbes say they value teams by calculating their \"enterprise values (equity plus debt) that are based on multiples of revenue that teams garner from television, premium seating, media, licensing, merchandise and concessions.\" But speaking to CNN, sports business expert Simon Chadwick questioned the relevance of measuring value in this way. \"Real Madrid, Manchester United and Barcelona are all in the top-10 list of the most indebted clubs in the world, even if their revenue streams are healthy and strongly established,\" he said. \"The implication of measuring value in this way seems to be that many clubs in the top-10 are simply buying their success by signing players, building debt and winning trophies. \"It will be interesting to see the extent to which the UEFA Financial Fair Play initiative moderates valuations in coming Forbes league tables.\" UEFA's new rules are designed to make Europe's clubs live within their means and attempt to break even each year, though there is an allowance for debt in the initial stages of their strategy. Chadwick believes the figures underline just how immune soccer is to the financial difficulties being experienced in Europe. He says the upward spiral shows no signs of abating. \"While football clubs clearly have tremendous financial value and commercial potential, some of the figures being reported here are staggering,\" he added. \"For Real Madrid to almost double its financial value in 12 months is incredible, especially set against the backdrop of economic austerity (particularly in Spain) and competition from other sports and industrial sectors. \"If these figures are a truly accurate and rigorous measure of value, then they are stunning. Even at the top-end of the game, clubs are relatively underdeveloped as commercial entities. \"With changes in management practice, a stronger commercial emphasis, and global marketplace development, then one can only speculate how much further the value of top clubs might increase.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Forbes ranks Real Madrid ($3.3 billion) above Manchester United ($3.17 billion) in club value.

Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war. A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt. The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and U.N. estimates. Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims. On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed. Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting, mostly in the south. The Israeli military, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks. The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters. With tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week. Ziad Thabet, a Gaza Education Ministry official, said classes in the strip are set to begin on September 14. The U.N. said most of the displaced were to be evacuated to temporary housing by yesterday afternoon, but Thabet said the schools need to undergo repairs before they can be used.

An opinion poll released today found the popularity of the Hamas militant group had spiked significantly among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip following the war. The poll, conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research and headed by leading Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki, indicated that 61 per cent of Palestinians would choose the Islamic militant group's leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for president if Palestinian presidential elections were held today. Only 32 per cent would vote for current President Mahmoud Abbas, Hamas' rival, the survey suggested.

An opinion poll released today found the popularity of the Hamas militant group had spiked significantly among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip following the war. Pictured is a masked Palestinian militant of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). The support for Haniyeh marks a stark increase from a poll in June, conducted by the same pollster, which found only 41 per cent of Palestinians backed the Hamas figure. At the time, Abbas had 53 percent support. The poll also suggests a majority of Palestinians - 72 per cent - support adopting Hamas' armed approach in the West Bank. The research center said it is the first time in eight years that a majority of Palestinians has voiced such support for the Hamas leader. But, it said, Hamas' popularity might fall in coming months, as it did following previous Israel-Hamas conflicts. Polling started on the last day of the war, on August 26, and continued during the first four days of the ceasefire, the research center said. The poll said 79 per cent of respondents believe Hamas won the war, and 86 per cent support the renewal of rocket fire on Israel if a blockade on Gaza is not lifted, one of Hamas' main demands.

The expropriation of about 1,000 acres of West Bank land could help clear the way for new Jewish settlement construction. Lapid said such moves create 'redundant arguments with the United States and the world' and criticized the timing of the announcement following the Gaza war. Israel's Justice Minister, Tzipi Livni, also criticized the move this week.

Netanyahu has spoken vaguely about a new 'diplomatic horizon' that has emerged following the 50-day Israel-Hamas war. He has given few details on what he means. But Netanyahu has said that he is not willing to renew peace talks with Abbas, saying the Palestinian leader will have to first distance himself from Hamas militants. Hamas and Abbas' Palestinian Authority recently agreed to a unity deal that saw the formation of a government backed by both factions. 'He has to choose,' Netanyahu told Israeli Channel Two in a weekend interview. 'It's either yes to Hamas or no to Hamas.' Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars rained on their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war, while schools in Gaza remained shuttered as the territory recovered from the fighting. The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to rocket-scarred communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting remained fresh. In the southern city of Ashdod, employees at the 'Pashosh' kindergarten, which was struck by a rocket, removed shrapnel marks off the walls and slides ahead of the students' arrival. 'We are a little scared but we are excited,' said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher in its school. 'A lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine.'

Her ashes will be buried in Pennsylvania, next to her late husband. Thompson's only child George Thompson, 72, said she died as he flew from his home in California to see her. She had congestive heart failure. Aged nicely: Thompson, pictured with a friend in 1999, enjoyed dancing and singing until the end . 'She had such a big heart,' he told\u00a0The Tampa Bay Times on Sunday. 'She was such a large person.' Thompson passed the baton to Jeralean Talley, who was born on May 23, 1899. As well as being the oldest person in the US, Talley, from Inkster, Michigan, is the oldest living black person and credits 'the Lord' as her secret to a long life. Thompson was born during the administration of President William McKinley and just a year after the close of the Spanish-American War. She was a stylish dresser who enjoyed ballroom dancing until shortly before her death. She also loved to sing and play the piano, the Times reported. Susie Harper, 59, Thompson's caregiver of 13 years, said she never saw the elderly woman in a bad mood. Long life: On the brink of her 114th birthday, Elsie Calvert Thompson, pictured, died peacefully in her Florida apartment . Secret: At age 111, Thompson divulged the secret to longevity: 'I love people,' she said . In fact, Harper said the 113-year-old . told the Times she glided from bed every morning with a smile and was a . 'tireless hostess' who always offered guests food and drink despite . being well over a century old. 'She would wake up and say, \"Oh my, . won't you look outside? Isn't it beautiful?\" And if it was raining, she . would say, \"That's okay, we'll make our own sunshine,\"' Harper said. Thompson . had been in the record books for her remarkable age for four years . before she won the distinguished title of being the oldest living . American. At age 111, Thompson divulged the secret to longevity. 'I love people,' she told the Times back then.

Record books: Elsie Calvert Thompson was the fourth-oldest person in the world . Big milestone: Elsie Thompson, pictured on her last birthday, was just weeks shy of turning 114 . Those steps are seen as wise by many, as two of the previous title-holders died as a result of infections last month. Both 116-year-old Besse Cooper and 115-year-old Dina Manfredini died in December. Reporters from The Tampa Bay Times . met with Thompson on her 111th, 112th, and 113th birthdays, but the flu . precautions kept them away when she earned her title recently. Thompson was known for having a zest for life that many did not expect of someone her age. 'You'll say, \"Elsie, honey, you wanna get up?\" And she'll say, \"You betcha.\" Sometimes she'll talk and talk,' Harper said of the woman in January. Harper had worked with Thompson for the past 13 years as she continued to live in her own condominium in Clearwater, Florida as opposed to an assisted living facility. New elder: Thompson passed the baton to Jeralean Talley, pictured left, who was born on May 23, 1899.

'Sometimes when she's tired, she . doesn't want to say anything. But she has a happy and uplifting spirit . about her,' Ms Harper told The Tampa Bay Times. Thompson is one of the only 14 people left on Earth who were on the planet during the 19th century. Thompson stopped traveling to California to visit her son and his family son time before her death. He initially pushed for her to move to be nearer to him and his family when his father- her longtime husband- died in 1986, but she opted to stay in Florida. 'It has continued to work because she's well taken care of,' he told The Tampa Bay Times in January. 'It's a different world here, and she's so familiar with everything there.

Scot Lawrie proved a last day hero after his 5&3 victory over Brandt Snedeker helped his team retain the trophy, but he did not enjoy being the butt of the American supporters. \"I didn't get abused, but you get 'top it, shank it, you're a loser', stuff like that, every shot you play,\" he said. It came as no surprise to the 43-year-old veteran, who played in the infamous \"Battle of Brookline\" in 1999 where raucous home support helped the Americans overturn a four-point deficit on the last day. This time the boot was on the other foot, as inspired by team captain Jose Maria Olazabal, the Europeans silenced the crowd and pulled off the same feat in the concluding singles. \"It makes it all the more satisfying on Sunday night when you're standing there with the Ryder Cup in front of you and they are not. I think it helps us, to be fair. \"I think they (the United States team) said it's the same when they come here. Apparently that's how it is, but I can't see that.\" Lawrie has returned to a heroes welcome on home soil where he will be playing in the Alfred Dunhill Links tournament this week. \"Since I arrived here I can hardly get a ball hit for people coming up kind of slapping you on the back. It's been lovely,\" he added. Germany's Martin Kaymer, who holed the testing final putt to make sure Europe retained the Ryder Cup as he beat Steve Stricker, is also in the field. Kaymer had rolled his initial birdie putt on the 18th at Medinah about six foot past the hole to leave the Europe supporters with their hearts in their mouth. \"Even though it was more difficult in the end, it was an even better feeling. Of course it was a lot of pressure, but I see it more like a gift what happened,\" he told the official European Tour website. \"There will never, ever, be a more important putt in my life. Even if I have a chance in two years' time again (At Gleneagles) I've done it before already,\" added the 27-year-old.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\nThis was, Sergio Garcia conceded, much like being hunted by Tiger, complete with the roars that\u00a0 provided the first sign of danger. Only this time here it was Rory McIlroy who was terrorising the two golfers ahead of him. McIlroy who was drawing deafening applause from the crowds in the group behind. For Garcia and Rickie Fowler, it made the final few holes of a dramatic third round here in Hoylake all the more torturous. As Fowler dropped a shot on 17, his third bogey in four holes, McIlroy could be heard making eagle on the adjacent 16th. Under pressure: Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler during the third round on Saturday . As the American and the Spaniard then made their way across the third fairway to the scorer's tent, there came another roar for yet another eagle on 18 for the Ulsterman. Fowler had just birdied 18 but even that failed to stop the gap between first and second widening. Defending champion Phil Mickelson felt he missed a good opportunity to move up the leaderboard on day three. Mickelson was among the day's first starters, teeing off at 9am, but failed to take advantage of unexpectedly good conditions. The lefthander fired a 71 to lie 15 shots behind leader Rory McIlroy overnight and said: 'We had beautiful scoring conditions, first group off. If we could have shot seven, eight, nine under par it probably was out there. It was as easy as I've seen the course play. We could have made some noise. 'It could have been a lot lower and I let a lot of shots slide.' Mickelson, who came through the field to win with a final-round 66 at Muirfield last year, opened here with rounds of 74 and 70. Garcia admitted afterwards that playing McIlroy in this kind of form is as daunting as waging war against Woods in his prime; an almost futile exercise however well those in\u00a0 the chasing pack might be playing. 'I don't think Rory has been as consistent as Tiger was for so many years, but when he's at his best he's right up there,' said Garcia. 'Obviously I heard the roar on 16. I didn't know but I imagined it was an eagle. The only thing you can do is say \"well done\".' For Fowler is proved particularly galling. He was tearing up this course in near perfect conditions, going through the turn in 32\u00a0 and then birdying 10, 11 and 12\u00a0 to erase the six-shot advantage McIlroy had taken into the third round. But then came that crushing run of bogies and with it an emphatic McIlroy response. Fowler will nevertheless take encouragement from the fact that the six-shot lead McIlroy now has this afternoon can be closed, because he did it in 12 holes yesterday. He can also draw some comfort in knowing his two professional wins to date were both achieved with McIlroy as runner-up. His first victory, the Wells Fargo Championship two years ago, came after beating McIlroy on the first extra hole of a sudden-death play-off. Add to that the benefit of having been in much the same position in the US Open last month, not to\u00a0 mention the confidence of having already finished in the top five in both majors this year, and Fowler goes into the final pairing today in decent shape. Feel the force: Rickie Fowler tees off on the 13th hole at Hoylake on Saturday . The advice he gets from Phil Mickleson, someone he referred to affectionately as his golf 'dad', is also sure to come in handy. What better mentor to have than last year's Open champion? 'I've learned a lot from Phil,' said Fowler. 'He's kind of been like, I hate to say it, but like a dad out here. It's been a lot of fun being around him. Not just playing on Tuesday, but having dinner with him and\u00a0 seeing how he operates on and off the golf course.' Thanks to the work he has been doing this past year with Butch\u00a0 Harmon \u2013 a coach Fowler described as the 'best in the world' \u2013 the young American has been\u00a0 itting his irons superbly and at times he putted beautifully too,\u00a0 sinking one from around 30 feet on the second hole. Garcia's approach on the eighth was also worthy of mention, even if he will want to\u00a0 forget the two-and-a-half foot putt he missed on 12. Garcia thinks it a tall order, catching McIlroy. 'If he shoots three under, I have to shoot 10,' he said with a smile. 'So if Rory plays the way he's been playing it's difficult to see anybody catching him. When Rory plays well every course suits him. There's not really a lot of weaknesses in his game.' In the swing: American Rickie Fowler has been hitting his irons superbly . Fowler knows that too, having grown up competing against\u00a0 McIlroy. They are just a few months apart in age \u2013 now both 25 \u2013 and are actually good friends as well as neighbours in Jupiter, Florida. They also have a penchant for brightly covered clothing even if McIlroy joked this week that\u00a0 Fowler's fashion sense \u2013 he will once again wear the orange of Olklahoma State University today \u2013 was highly questionable. 'We've travelled a bit together between tournaments,' said Fowler. 'We first played against each other at the Walker Cup in 2007 and it's kind of gone from there. So I'm\u00a0 looking forward to it tomorrow. It's going to be a good time. We're good buddies and at the same time we both want to beat up on each other as bad as possible. 'If I can go out and put a bit of pressure on him and make him earn it a bit, get myself in the mix, maybe we'll be able to throw some blows back and forth. 'The US Open last month was my first time in the final group at a major. But it was just a matter of time before the two of us found a way to sneak into a final group together.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Rory McIlroy's strong performance in the third round of a Hoylake golf tournament put competitors Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler on edge.

Dr Mark Harrison amassed a fortune as he charged the nurses \u00a3400 a day for training courses on injecting the toxic drug at his Harley Street clinic. Showing a \u2018cavalier\u2019 attitude to safety, he told them to give Botox to patients without a prescription. Dr Mark Harrison amassed a fortune as he charged the nurses \u00a3400 a day for training courses on illegally injecting Botox. Pictured: Dr Harrison advertises his training in a video . He admitted the practice was \u2018naughty\u2019 but said regulation was so lax they would get away with it. It is thought the 51-year-old, who lives in a \u00a34million townhouse in Kensington, West London, made more than \u00a31million from the scam. But Harrison, managing director of Harley Aesthetics, was exposed by an undercover BBC investigation in which a journalist posed as a trainee nurse to film him secretly. Yesterday he was condemned for his \u2018flippant, cavalier and deplorable\u2019 attitude at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing. The Fitness To Practise panel found him guilty of misconduct by encouraging the nurses to break the law and suspended him for 12 months. Botox is normally administered by a doctor to a patient with a valid prescription after a face-to-face consultation. But Harrison found a loophole in the law at the time that allowed remote prescribing in exceptional circumstances, and he authorised nurses to perform the procedure by speaking to them on his mobile. He charged \u00a330 for each \u2018consultation\u2019 and offered one-day training courses at his practice for nurses who wanted to administer Botox. It is thought the 51-year-old, who lives in a \u00a34million townhouse in Kensington, West London, made more than \u00a31million from the scam . The 2012 BBC investigation alleged Harrison told nurses to use Botox prescribed for one patient on another and actively encouraged them to not pay adequate regard to a patient\u2019s medical history before administering the jabs. The millionaire \u2013 who also owns a six-bedroom Gloucestershire mansion with a nearby private stable for his seven polo ponies and properties in the French Alps including a \u00a31million chalet and a hotel \u2013 boasted in his company newsletter that he carried out 50,000 remote prescriptions, suggesting he made \u00a31.5million from the phone calls alone. His company, one of the UK\u2019s largest purchasers of Botox, charged patients from \u00a3200 for a treatment. He was filmed telling nurses: \u2018Strictly speaking, a vial with a patient name on should only be used on that patient. We use it on a number of people. Is it ever an issue? No. It is not legal but it\u2019s what everybody does, doctors, professors, me. Just order a vial in your name \u2013 it\u2019s not policed at all.\u2019 Harrison also suggested that if nurses could not contact him before giving Botox they should go ahead and he would authorise it afterwards. He was condemned for his \u2018flippant, cavalier and deplorable\u2019 attitude at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing for carrying out the training courses at his Harley Street clinic (pictured) Suspending him following a hearing in Manchester, the panel said: \u2018The findings against Dr Harrison are wide-ranging, some are repeated and involve the potential to place patients at risk of harm. His conduct... could properly be described as deplorable.\u2019 In a letter to the panel, Dr Harrison said: \u2018I can understand that on a busy ward with lots of different vials and lots of different patients, to use vials between patients would be dangerous. It would be unacceptable. 'However, in the context of Botox where you have a single practitioner administering a single medication to one patient at a time, I would contend that that is not dangerous, but I have not been accused of doing it. I do not encourage nurses to do that.\u2019 In the wake of the investigation into Harrison, the GMC has banned doctors from remotely prescribing cosmetic injections such as Botox, meaning they must hold a face-to-face consultation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dr. Harrison, owner of Harley Aesthetics, exploited a loophole to train nurses in illegal Botox administration.

Such is the clamor for tickets for Coventry City's return to the Ricoh Arena that one supporter was prepared to camp outside the box office on Wednesday night. The Sky Blues will return to the city when they face Gillingham this weekend after more than a year playing their games in Northampton. But the club's loyal follower - known simply as 'Andy' - was saved from a night in the cold when a fellow City fan arrived at the ground to offer his spare ticket after hearing the story on Twitter. Front of the queue: Andy prepares for a night outside the ticket office with a cup of tea . Good Samaritan: A fellow Sky Blues supporter arrived to give Andy his spare ticket . Heading home: Coventry are to return to the Ricoh Arena after playing in Northampton for more than a year . Remaining tickets have been limited to two per person to deal with the demand from excited supporters. Steve Waggott, chief executive of Coventry City Football Club, said: 'You can feel the positivity around the city about our return to the Ricoh and long may that continue. 'Everyone is looking forward to Friday night and what should be a great occasion for the club and the city.' The League One side have ended their dispute with the stadium's owners, Arena Coventry Limited (ACL), and have reached an agreement to head back to the stadium they played in between 2005 and 2013. Back to where they belong: A fan protests at the Ricoh in 2013, prior to Coventry's move . Home from home: Coventry take on Barnsley earlier this month at their adopted home in Northampton . The two-year deal, with an option for an extra two years, should see the Sky Blues play at the Ricoh in their next home fixture, which is against Gillingham on 6 September. The deal was struck after Coventry owners Sisu paid ACL \u00a3471,192 via the Football League last week, with the money going towards compensation and unpaid rent. ACL had previously said it would not discuss a return until it received money owed by the club after they went into administration last year. Sisu and ACL first came into conflict in April 2012 when Coventry started to withhold what they felt was unreasonable rent from the stadium operators. The Sky Blues then agreed a three-year groundshare deal with Northampton - 35 miles away - with an option of a further two years, and the Cobblers will be due compensation after the early end of the deal.

Properties are exchanging hands for 6.8 per cent more this month than a year ago, the lowest pace since November 2013 according to Nationwide . Separate Land Registry figures said prices in England and Wales in the year to December rose 7 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent in November and the fourth month in a row that the annual rate has fallen. Both sets of figures show that average house prices have remained static since last summer. The Nationwide said the reasons for the slowdown in the housing market since then 'remain unclear', as the economic background has in fact continued to improve. But it predicted that house prices would take off again once people started to feel the benfit of pay rises. Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said the number of mortgages approved  had been about 20 per cent below last year - and surveyors continued to report subdued levels of new buyer enquiries. But Mr Gardner said the reasons for the continued slowdown were unclear given the fall in unemployment, wages that have started to rise faster than inflation and high levels of consumer confidence which have helped fuel strong retail sales growth. 'If the economic backdrop continues to improve as we and most forecasters expect, activity in the housing market is likely to regain momentum in the months ahead,' he said. Britain's five year house price boom has benefited Conservative supporting areas much more than Labour constituencies . Prices were also likely to be supported by the long-term shortage of new houses coming onto the market. 'It is encouraging that the number of new homes built in England was up 8 percent in the year to the third quarter of 2014. However, this is still 34 percent below pre-crisis levels and little over half the expected rate of household formation in the years ahead,' Gardner said. The Land Registry data showed that London house prices ended the year up by 16.3 per cent, at an average of \u00a3464,936. In nine boroughs prices were up by more than a fifth over the year, and in every part of the capital rises were in double digits. The biggest leap in prices was in the north-east borough of Waltham Forest, which includes Walthamstow, which saw prices increase by 25.1 per cent to an average of \u00a3368,000. Kensington & Chelsea recorded the lowest level of growth within London, at 11.5 per cent over the year, but the average price was still a lofty \u00a31.3million."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "UK house prices are rising slowly, with an average of \u00a3188,446 nationwide and \u00a3464,936 in London, according to Nationwide and Land Registry.

Senators voted down the legislation by 39 votes to 29, after hours of heated debate that saw one politician break down in tears as she described the plight of one 15-year-old boy's journey from Afghanistan. Soon after the vote, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that former defence force chief Angus Houston would lead \"an expert group\" to determine the best way forward on asylum seekers, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"I want to be very clear about the role of this expert group,\" Gillard said. \"This expert group will receive the facts from Government and beyond. They will be able at their option to receive briefings wherever they want to get those briefings from. They will be able to assemble all of the material to help them form their views. They will be able to consult as they see fit,\" the ABC reported. The dilemma of what to do with thousands of asylum seekers who attempt the risky trip by boat to Australia each year has long divided the nation's political parties, and its people. However, the sinking of two boats in the past week carrying more than 300 people lent the issue urgency ahead of parliament's long winter break. More than 200 people were pulled from the sea near Christmas Island, north of Australia, after the separate accidents. It's not clear how many died because authorities don't have an accurate count of how many people were on board the vessels. Two years ago, Mujtaba Ahmadi made a similar treacherous journey from Indonesia on a fishing boat packed with more than 70 other people seeking a new life in Australia. He was just 15 years old. \"We came direct from Jakarta to Christmas Island. There are a lot of ways, this is the short way but it's very dangerous,\" Ahmadi said. \"There were too many people on the boat. We didn't have any space to sleep. We didn't have enough life jackets.\" The teenager left Iran with his family's blessing; his father borrowed money from his friends and his mother and sister sold their jewelry to raise $11,000. Some was spent on flights, while half was paid to people smugglers for the 50-hour boat trip. \"I heard that there are a lot of human rights in Australia. That's why I decided to come to Australia,\" he said. \"But then I arrived in a detention center, I thought no, there are no human rights in Australia.\" Ahmadi spent two months in detention on Christmas Island before being transferred to a hotel in Darwin, the Asti Motel, which for a time was used as a temporary detention center. He stayed there for eight months before being granted a visa to stay. Now 18, Ahmadi is learning English in Sydney and is following the debate among the nation's politicians as best he can, though he still can't understand why he spent so long in detention. \"We didn't do anything wrong. We are not criminals,\" he said. If the bill -- the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012 -- had been passed Thursday, it would have allowed Australia to send asylum seekers to Malaysia and the island of Nauru in the South Pacific for processing. It also would have marked a revival of Gillard's controversial \"Malaysia Solution,\" a deal agreed with the Malaysian government to send 800 asylum seekers there each year for processing in exchange for 4,000 refugees to Australia. The deal was ruled invalid last August by the High Court on the grounds that Malaysia has no legal obligation to protect asylum seekers, something required under Australia's Migration Act. Despite fierce opposition from the coalition and the Greens Party, the House of Parliament narrowly passed the bill late Wednesday, clearing the way for the Senate vote. The Greens said they were pleased the government had announced a multi-party committee to look into the issue, but said more could have been done. \"The government could, today, have taken the pressure off these desperate people to get on boats by immediately resettling thousands of people waiting in Indonesia and Malaysia, properly resourcing the UNHCR and increasing search and rescue capability,\" Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young said in a statement. The bill's defeat leaves the country without an effective response to attempts by asylum seekers to enter the country. The expert group has been asked to report back before parliament resumes in mid- August, the ABC said. The number of boats attempting the journey rose dramatically after Labor's Kevin Rudd defeated long-term Liberal leader John Howard in a federal election in 2007. During his time in power, Rudd unraveled Howard's policies, including the \"Pacific Solution,\" which involved diverting asylum seekers to detention camps on remote Pacific islands. The Howard policies were slammed by critics as inhumane, however supporters credited them with deterring large numbers of people from boarding boats to Australia. \"They were humane as they possibly could be in the circumstances,\" Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey told the ABC before Thursday's Senate vote. He said the coalition was pushing for a policy of turning back boats when possible, reopening the processing center on Nauru and granting asylum seekers temporary protection visas. The coalition would never support the Malaysia \"people swap,\" he added. Since replacing Rudd as Labor leader, Gillard has adopted a tougher stance on asylum seekers but has resisted calls from the opposition to return to the Howard policies."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Australia's Senate rejected the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill, reviving the 'Malaysia Solution' for offshore asylum seeker detention.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\nThis week, House Speaker John Boehner announced that the House will not consider immigration reform this year. Despite growing numbers and increasing political influence of the nation's Latino population, the House leadership has chosen to show it disrespect. How shameful. Here is some context: Last year, 409,849 human beings -- mothers, fathers, sons and daughters -- were torn from their families and deported. Millions have been exploited, forced to live in unrelenting fear of workplace raids and criminalized as they seek a fair pathway to citizenship. An entire generation of immigrants, the majority of whom are immigrants of color, are relegated to second-class status. Sadly, many of the same corporations that build the country's correctional facilities also build and run prison-like immigrant detention facilities. Since the Illegal Immigration Reform Act and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which cuts off long-standing policies of pardoning eligible immigrants who were at one point undocumented, and since 9/11, even the path to legality and recognition as human beings with equal rights has become an illusion. The breakdown of our democratic values does not end there. The path to equal representation in our democracy \u2014 our fundamental right to vote \u2014 must also be urgently addressed. On June 25, the Supreme Court struck down the formula of the Voting Rights Act needed for the federal government to protect rights in states with long histories of discrimination. Just two hours after the decision, Texas announced it would reinstate its strict voter ID law. This law had already been struck down by the Justice Department as discriminatory against Latinos and African Americans -- groups significantly less likely to have the limited forms of government-issued photo ID required under the law. Florida has followed suit by purging its voting rolls, ensnaring former immigrants who are now citizens despite the lack of measurable non-citizen voter fraud. Under the purge procedure, Florida's immigrant communities may be at risk of getting hit with letters questioning their citizenship status, hearing dates, requirements to show their papers and the costs of replacing lost documents. The state renewed this intimidating attempt to scare off communities of naturalized citizens, despite having settled a discrimination claim brought over a similar purge in 2012 by Advancement Project, Latino Justice, other national voting rights groups, and Florida-based Latino and Haitian American community groups. In state after state across the country, voter ID and other \"show me your papers to vote\" laws, laws that disparately impact immigrants of color, are being pursued at an alarming rate. Given our nation's long history of racial discrimination, it is perhaps not surprising that there is a great backlash against inclusion and equality as the face of our nation changes and the immigrant population grows dramatically.  Restrictions on voting rights based on race have been going on since formerly enslaved black Americans first became \"citizens\" and eligible to vote. But disenfranchisement is not the American way. True democracy is impossible if millions have no road map to become citizens, and if those who are citizens have their voting rights challenged at every turn. For a true and just democracy, we must dismantle any ethnic and racial barriers to citizenship and voting rights. Only when each person, regardless of race or ethnicity, is allowed to equally participate will our fundamental notions of citizenship and democracy -- and indeed, the American dream -- be realized."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Boehner's decision against immigration reform disrespects Latinos.

It was a historic walk that observers say was in line with his appetite for the extreme and the high-wire customs of his \"Flying Wallendas\" family. Pumping his fist in the air, Wallenda sprinted the last few steps on the wire. After touching down on Canadian soil, he embraced his family, grinning ear to ear. The tense 1,800-foot journey took 25 minutes, according to CNN affiliate CTV. \"I'm extremely blessed to be where I am,\" Wallenda said after stepping onto Canadian soil. Gotta watch: Tightrope stunts . To abide with immigration law, he had a U.S. passport tucked in a plastic bag in his pocket during the trip, according to the affiliate. Two border guards were waiting as soon as he stepped on Canadian soil to ensure he had the correct paperwork. \"It hasn't sunk in yet,\" he told ABC, which broadcast the event. \"This is something that I've played over and over in my mind for the last 20 years, and to finally be here at this point, it is very surreal. As I said as I left that wire, I'm extremely blessed to be where I am.\" Wallenda described the difficulties of dealing with the wind and heavy mist from the roaring falls. \"It's all about the concentration, the focus, and it all goes back to the training. You know, in the middle of the wire at one point, I just started thinking about great-grandfather and paying tribute to him and all the walks that he did,\" he said. His great-grandfather Karl Wallenda was killed at the age of 73, attempting to walk between two buildings in Puerto Rico in 1978. When asked by ABC how he planned to top the walk over Niagara Falls, Wallenda said he hopes to become the first person in the world to walk a tightrope across the Grand Canyon, in Arizona. Thousands were on hand to watch Wallenda teeter his way on the 2-inch-wide wire over Horseshoe Falls toward Canada. He wore a harness at the insistence of those sponsoring the event, officials say, despite what he said was his desire to walk without a safety rig. Nik Wallenda, 121 feet in the air: 'It's extremely important to never let your mind wander' Wearing a red and black rain jacket and a balance pole around his neck, Wallenda appeared calm and focused as he took small steps, gingerly placing one foot in front of the other. Wallenda, who hails from multiple generations of high-flying daredevils, had a near fall as he stumbled on a tightrope above Baltimore's Inner Harbor earlier this year. \"It's been a dream of mine for a long time,\" Wallenda told CNN before the Niagara Falls attempt. \"I'm one of those people who always tries to overachieve. I want to do more. I want to do bigger things.\" Other daredevils have tried their luck walking over Niagara, but farther downstream and not since 1896.

The company is protesting Mozilla's new CEO, Brendan Eich, who supported an anti-same-sex marriage campaign. Firefox is owned by Mozilla. When OkCupid members navigate to the site on a Firefox browser, they are met with a message encouraging them to use an alternative browser to access the site, including Google Chrome, Opera, Safari and the amusingly misspelled Internet Exploder. \"Those who seek to deny love and instead enforce misery, shame and frustration are our enemies, and we wish them nothing but failure,\" reads the message. The page points out that 8% of the matches made on OkCupid are between same-sex couples. Last week, Mozilla promoted Eich, a longtime employee who was previously the company's chief technology officer, to the position of CEO. The move prompted renewed outrage by third-party developers and employees. Eich donated $1,000 to support Propostion 8 in 2008. The California ballot initiative sought to ban same-sex marriage in the state. The donation was made public in 2012 but Eich held onto his job. After the announcement of Eich's promotion, app development company Rarebit announced it had pulled its apps from Firefox. \"As a married gay couple who are co-founders of this venture, we have chosen to boycott all Mozilla projects,\" said founder Hampton Catlin in an open letter to the company. Various Mozilla employees have also spoken up about the promotion, taking to Twitter to openly share their disappointment with Eich's politics. Some have come together and publicly called for Eich to step down. Eich posted a blog on his personal site last week addressing the backlash. He outlined his plan to support LGBT-friendly policies at Mozilla and expressed \"sorrow at having caused pain.\" \"I am committed to ensuring that Mozilla is, and will remain, a place that includes and supports everyone,\" he said. The apology hasn't satisfied everyone, and the backlash continues to grow one week later. OkCupid is one of the most high-profile companies to take a stand against Eich's appointment.

The West African nation's long-awaited, much-delayed second round presidential runoff between Diallo and Alpha Conde is scheduled for Sunday. But more than a week of violence and intimidation that has forced thousands of people to leave their homes in the towns of Siguiri, Kouroussa and Kissidougou in eastern Guinea has soured what would be the nation's most credible democratic presidential vote in its 52-year history. Are you there? Share images and video with CNN iReport . Ananie Kashironge, head of media relations for the International Committee of the Red Cross in Conakry, the nation's capital, told CNN on Tuesday that 2,800 people were displaced on October 29 and 30 alone. In addition, commercial trucks filled with ethnic Peul and all their possessions have been leaving the eastern towns of Siguiri (about 800 kilometers from Conakry) and Kouroussa (about 580 kilometers from Conakry) every day for the past 12 days, and local officials for Diallo's UFDG party say a total of 15,000 to 20,000 Peul have been displaced around the country. Most of the displaced people have traveled west to the Fouta Djallon region, where they have relatives, the officials say. After a rally for Conde in Conakry on October 22 in which dozens of supporters fell sick after drinking contaminated water and yogurt, ethnic Malinke people attacked Peul in Upper Guinea, especially in Siguiri and Kouroussa, for days. Those displaced spoke of Malinke men looting and burning Peul-owned businesses and demolishing homes where Peul lived in Siguiri. Officials for Diallo's party said they registered the deaths of three Peul in Siguiri, one who had been fatally beaten and two who had died after being struck by stones. Conde, whose father is from the Malinke ethnic group, draws much of his support from the majority Malinke region of Upper Guinea, where most of the violence happened. Diallo, an ethnic Peul, has his base of supporters in the northwestern Fouta Djallon region. Sabo Camara, the campaign director for the UFDG party in Dabola, a town on the border of the Fouta Djallon and Upper Guinea regions where many Peul have stayed or passed through, said the violence seemed planned. \"They don't want [the Peul] to vote and we heard that they even put out a communique on local radio saying that if [the Peul] stay there until election day they will kill all of them,\" Camara told CNN on Monday. \"We estimate that 15 to 20,000 people have passed through or stayed in Dabola\" since October 22,\" he added. \"Many told us that meetings had been organized, and razors and knives distributed to get rid of the Peul by force.\" One displaced man said those who forced them out made no secret of the reason. \"They told us, 'Come election day not a single Peul will vote here,' which is why they chased us away,\" said Thierno Barry, who left Siguiri with his family and all their belongings and was heading for his village of origin in the Fouta Djallon region. And a displaced Peul woman traveling from Siguiri who asked not to be named for safety reasons told a similar story. \"They gave out a list of people from the Peul ethnic group and said that they have to leave before the election or they will be killed,\" she said. Camara said the authorities in Siguiri and Kouroussa, members of a military junta who has ruled Guinea since December, 2008, did not do anything to stop the violence. \"We are under the impression that the authorities are complicit. Otherwise how can there be such trouble for four, five days without the authorities intervening,\" he said. Cheik Kaba, a Malinke businessman in Kankan, an upper Guinea city some 120 kilometers from Siguiri, told CNN that anti-Peul violence had spread to Kankan but had been contained because of local peace efforts. Conakry supporters of Conde's RPG party \"called us to say that [the Peul] poisoned RPG members. ... Everyone wanted to destroy everything here, but we reasoned with them and made them understand that it is our country and Guinea belongs to everyone, so they left them alone,\" Kaba said. Dr. Mohamed Saliou Camara, professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida and author of a book on Guinea's independence leader, told CNN recently that \"ethnicity becomes truly a problem when politicians resort to it to compensate for their lack of viable ideological platform and political program to meaningfully mobilize the electorate.\" The number of displaced people has once again complicated efforts to hold a credible second round of presidential elections. Siaka Toumani Sangare, the retired Malian general in charge of Guinea's electoral commission, told journalists at a press conference on Monday that the government was taking measures to ensure that those displaced will be able to vote. But with thousands of displaced people now in remote villages with electoral cards left behind in Siguiri and Kouroussa, it will be very difficult for the inefficient Guinean government to reach all those affected. \"We are very scared because this is a dangerous precedent, a very dangerous precedent,\" Sabo Camara said. \"If people who have lived in a place for 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, are told to leave the houses they have built, the businesses filled with their goods, it's really quite worrying.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ahead of Guinea's presidential runoff, violence from Conde's supporters, the Malinke ethnic group, has displaced thousands of ethnic Peul, Diallo's supporters, in Siguiri and Kouroussa.

To anyone under the age of 40, Paul Elliott is instantly recognisable as one half of the Chuckle Brothers, children\u2019s TV favourites from 1987 onwards. With Paul playing straight man to his hapless older brother Barry, the pair made\u00a0 an impressive 21 series of their hit BBC show Chucklevision, famous for its slapstick humour and catchphrases such as \u2018to me, to you\u2019. They filmed their last series in 2009, making it the longest running sitcom after Last Of The Summer Wine. Regular at this pub: Chuckle Brother Paul Elliot in the bar at his home 'Half Acre' in Hatfield, Doncaster, South Yorkshire . With their success came all the trappings, and Paul\u2019s five-bedroom gated home, Half Acres \u2013 with its well-stocked bar room, snooker room and grounds of one-and-a-half acres \u2013 is testimony to this. Set in the pleasant village of Hatfield in South Yorkshire, Half Acres is a 15-minute drive from Doncaster and not far from Rotherham, where Paul and Barry grew up in a council house with their two older brothers and their parents \u2013 mum Amy and father James, a gang show performer. However,\u00a0 you could say that Paul has become a victim of his own success. The palatial house, set down a private road, has been on the market for nearly two years. Despite reducing the asking price by \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3550,000, he has yet to find a buyer. \u2018We\u2019ve had only four or five viewings in all that time,\u2019 says Paul, who believes the house may be just too expensive for local buyers. \u2018The average house price around here is in the region of \u00a395,000; we\u2019re charging more than five times that.\u2019 Hard sell: Mr Elliot has been forced to lower the price for the home with \u00a3150,000 to \u00a3550,000 as he struggles to find a buyer . In frustration, he has just changed estate agents. According to Julian Brown, director at Portfield, Garrard and Wright, Paul\u2019s new agents, it has been a tough few years for prices in the region. He explains that prices have yet to recover to pre-2008 levels but things are starting to look up. \u2018Last month was cracking, our best in four years,\u2019 he says, \u2018but there are few buyers in Paul\u2019s price range and because it\u2019s such a unique property, it has to find its own level.\u2019 Paul\u2019s material possessions have been hard won. This is the Chuckle Brothers\u2019 50th year as a double act \u2013 they found fame after winning the TV talent show New Faces in 1974 \u2013 and the pair have just embarked on their 46th panto run, in Darlington. Although both in their late 60s, the brothers show no sign of slowing down and spend their time travelling around the country for personal appearances at everything from pub quizzes to corporate team-building events, as well as touring with their own show. \u2018I can\u2019t imagine retiring because it\u2019s such good fun,\u2019 says Paul. Chuckling away: The five-bedroom home also has a snooker table and an en-suite master bedroom . He admits the panto season \u2013 two performances a day, six days a week until February \u2013 is pretty exhausting. \u2018It\u2019s not an easy life but it\u2019s better than going down the pit,\u2019 says Paul, whose first job was working in a Sheffield steelworks. Paul and wife Sue, 56, bought Half Acres for \u00a3300,000 in 2002 and have spent about \u00a350,000 extending it, adding a master bedroom suite with bathroom and dressing room. Now that their youngest two sons are in their early 20s, they are keen to downsize and plan to spend much of the year at their Brittany farmhouse. Despite struggling to sell his current home, Paul still thinks property is a good place to invest his money. \u2018Obviously I\u2019m not happy about having to reduce the price but we will still have made money on the house if we sell for the new asking price.\u2019 The couple decided to invest in other properties soon after moving to Half Acres. They built a five-bedroom villa with pool on the Greek island of Kefalonia, which they rent to holidaymakers, and own a two-bedroom apartment on the island, where they themselves holiday. They have also bought a two-bed apartment in Calabria, Italy, which they visit twice a year. portfieldgarrard.com ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Paul Elliott, a TV star from the Chuckle Brothers, is struggling to sell his South Yorkshire home, despite a \u00a3150,000 price cut.

It wasn't a wonderful event. But I would take another one.\" Amber Haslerud, another passenger, said her voyage on the ill-fated Carnival Cruise ship Splendor was her first cruise, and she would also go on another one. \"I definitely would give it another go and try to get the experience I should have had this time,\" said Haslerud. \"I deserve it after all that we went through this week.\" The ship and its approximately 3,300 passengers arrived in San Diego on Thursday, four days after a fire in the engine room left the ship without air conditioning, hot showers or refrigeration one day into a scheduled seven-day cruise along the Mexican coast. \"It was absolutely deplorable,\" passenger Marquis Horace said. At one point, the ship ran out of food, he said, and \"they started making mayo sandwiches.\" Passengers said they weren't told there was a fire until they left the ship. Horace said the crew informed passengers only of \"a flameless fire.\" Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz said officials initially spoke only of smoke because the crew couldn't get into the engine room to assess the situation. Passengers were advised of the fire once it was confirmed, she said. Maritime law doesn't require cruise lines to tell passengers about onboard problems, said Robert Jarvis, a professor of law at Nova Southern University in Fort Lauderdale, Flordia. He said it sometimes makes sense to limit or delay the release of information to avoid a panic. Carnival's position is to inform passengers any time an issue will affect their cruise, de la Cruz said. The cruise line has said it plans to give customers who were aboard the Splendor a full refund, reimbursement for travel costs and a free cruise. Natalie Martinez and Angela Evans are among those who said they would also go on another cruise. But they said they would bring a survival kit with flashlights, chocolate and air freshener. And \"I think we would wait a year,\" Martinez added.. Some passengers aren't sure if they'll cruise again. Maurice Harold and his wife, Cynthia Harold, not only had to endure being adrift, they had to do so without some of their own clothes, medicines and other items lost when their luggage went into the water while being loaded onto the ship. \"It was pretty traumatic. It was a scary situation, said Cynthia Harold, who said she needs to use an oxygen machine while sleeping and was unable to after the ship lost power. \"I really haven't slept since I left Virginia Beach,\" she said. The couple said they were unsure of their next steps, adding that it all depends on how Carnival compensates them. Others looked at the incident differently calling it an \"adventure.\" \"A lot of things went wrong, but it was really fun,\" said one young passenger, Ryan Harlan, who was traveling with his parents. \"We went to the Kids' Camp.\" He said the Kids' Camp was, in fact, his favorite part, because he made some friends. And the worst part? \"Being stranded in the middle of the ocean,\" he said. The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it was investigating the incident. But later in the day the safety board said officials from Panama would lead the investigation because that is the country the vessel is flagged under. The U.S. Coast  Guard will also be part of the investigation, the transportation board said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A fire crippled a Carnival Cruise Lines ship, leaving 3,300 passengers without amenities and some without luggage.

Blackadder actor Tony Robinson, One Foot in the Grave star Richard Wilson and Homeland\u2019s David Harewood also declared their support for the Union, and they were joined by well-known pro-UK supporters Eddie Izzard and John Barrowman.

It has even suggested a playlist of songs that supporters can listen to on their MP3 players, including We Are Family by Sister Sledge, Let\u2019s Stick Together by Bryan Ferry and Stay By Me by Annie Lennox.

When the United Nations delegates last . met to discuss the laws of the virtual land, it was 1988, and the Internet was pretty . much unheard of within the general public. At that time, Google was still a twinkle in the eyes of two 15-year-olds, auctions could only be won if you attended in person, and Amazon was a river in South America. Now that the Internet is an everyday commodity for much of the world, the talks, starting today in Dubai, will see a variety of viewpoints raised. Some nations, including Russia. having previously pressed for internet controls and censorship, while others, including a U.S. delegation, pressing for web freedom. Time to conference call: Participants listen to the speech of Hamdoun Toure, Secretary General of the International Telecommunication, at the Dubai conference . Some delegates at the Dubai conference - including a 123-member U.S. delegation with envoys from tech giants such as Google and Microsoft - worry that any new U.N. ruling could be used by nations such as China and Russia to justify further tightening of Web blocks and monitoring. Even Google got political as the . conference started, placing a message on its homepage today which reads: . 'Love the free and open Internet? Tell . the world's governments to keep it that way'. The 11-day conference highlights the . fundamental shift from tightly-managed telecommunications networks to . the borderless sweep of the Internet. The Dubai gathering will confront questions that include how much sway the U.N. can exert over efforts such as battling cyber-crimes and expanding the Internet into developing nations. The secretary-general of the U.N. International Telecommunications Union, Hamadoun Toure, said that accusations how the meeting could limit Web freedoms is 'completely untrue' and predicted only 'light-touch' regulations. Google gets political: The search engine posted a link as it campaigned to keep the Internet regulation-free . 'Many countries will come to reaffirm their desire to see freedom of expression embedded in this conference,' he told reporters on the meeting's opening day. However, the outcome of the Dubai gathering is far from certain. The 193 nations at the meeting have put forward more than 900 proposed regulatory changes covering the Internet, mobile roaming fees and satellite and fixed-line communications. Broad consensus is needed for any item to be adopted for any changes - the first major review of the U.N.'s telecommunications agenda since 1988, well before the Internet age. The gathering is also powerless to force nations to change their Internet policies, such as China's notorious 'Great Firewall' and widespread blackouts of political opposition sites in places including Iran and the Gulf Arab states. Last week, Syria's Internet and telephone services disappeared for two days during some of the worst fighting in months to hit the capital, Damascus. Switch on: Any attempts for increased Web regulations are likely to face stiff opposition from groups led by a major U.S. delegation . The head of the U.S. delegation in Dubai, Ambassador Terry Kramer, told reporters last week in Washington that all efforts should be made to avoid a 'Balkanization' of the Internet in which each country would impose its own rules and standards that could disrupt the flow of commerce and information. 'That opens the door ... to content censorship,' he said. The International Trade Union Confederation, representing labor groups in more than 150 countries, claimed a bloc that includes China, Russia and several Middle East nations seeks to 'pave the way for future restrictions on both internet content or its users.' 'It is clear that some governments have an interest in changing the rules and regulations of the Internet,' the confederation said in statement Monday. Another likely battle that will take place in Dubai is over European-backed suggestions to change the pay structure of the Web to force content providers - such as Google, Facebook Inc. and others - to kick in an extra fee to reach users across borders. Advocates of the changes say the money raised could pay to expand broadband infrastructures in developing countries. Toure said he hoped for a 'landmark' accord on trying to bring broadband Internet to developing countries. 'The Internet remains out of reach for 2/3 of world's people,' said Toure, who is from Mali. The U.N. telecommunications agency dates back to 1865, when the telegraph revolutionized the speed of information. Over the decades, it has expanded to include telephone, satellite and other advances in communications."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The UN's Dubai conference has 193 countries debating over 900 proposed internet regulatory changes.

But the former foreign secretary added his relationship with younger brother Ed is 'healing' and there was no point 'looking in the rear view mirror'. The ex-MP spoke candidly to veteran broadcaster Andrew Marr, who returned to his BBC show on Sunday, just six months after suffering a stroke. Hard to forget: David Milliband (right) has admitted he can 'never erase' the memory of losing against his brother, Ed during the 2010 Labour leadership contest . The interview was Mr Miliband's last before he moves to New York to head up the International Rescue Committee charity. Although he did not completely rule out a comeback, he added that leaving British politics would ensure an end to the 'soap opera' of the brothers' rivalry. Mr Miliband said: 'The truth is I did not think I would be in this position.But I am now, I'm excited, I am engaged. Of course I am sad to go, but I am excited by the challenge ahead.' He added: 'These things, you can never erase them from memory or history. 'But Ed and I are brothers for life. That is something that you value and that you nurture whatever the difficulty of the circumstances.' Asked if his relationship with Ed was 'healing', Mr Miliband replied: 'Of course.' Comparing the brothers to Wimbledon tennis finalists Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, he continued: 'The important thing though is that you've got to never lead your life by looking in the rear view mirror. 'You can't afford to end up eating yourself up with that kind of struggle. 'You've got to try and say, there are the Murrays of this world who win and there are the Djokovics who come second.

The danger is that could be a great prize for the Tories as well.

Even today -- when most Hollywood movies don't exactly fade to black after the lovers lock lips -- the best kisses still have the power to send shivers down the spine. In honor of Valentine's Day, InStyle chose the most memorable cinematic embraces: upside down, on a boat, and in the pouring rain. \"Gone with the Wind\" \"You need kissing badly,\" Clark Gable, as Rhett Butler, told Vivien Leigh's Scarlett O'Hara in this 1939 epic. \"You should be kissed, and often. And by someone who knows how.\" Later on, while proposing to the twice-widowed Scarlett, he proves he's the man for the job. See all 25 iconic movie kisses . \"Lady and the Tramp\" She was the original uptown girl; he was a lovable drifter. But when these two crazy pups came together over a very long piece of spaghetti in this 1955 animated film, it was forever. \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" Truman Capote's original 1958 novella wasn't exactly a love story, so the author was less than thrilled with the 1961 big screen adaptation. (For one thing, he'd wanted Marilyn Monroe to play Holly Golightly.) But audiences adored this stylish film, particularly for the final scene, in which Holly (Audrey Hepburn) and Paul (George Peppard) make a rainy New York City alley seem as romantic as any pink-streaked sunset. InStyle.com: The most stylish celebrity couples . \"When Harry Met Sally\" This 1989 comedy made numerous witty contributions to the romantic lexicon -- and kickstarted a (still-raging) debate as to whether men and women could \"really\" be friends -- but it was the pair's New Year's Eve reconciliation that moved viewers to tears. As Billy Crystal (Harry) told Meg Ryan (Sally): \"I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with someone, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.\" \"Pretty Woman\" \"I don't kiss on the mouth,\" Vivian (Julia Roberts) warns Edward (Richard Gere) at the beginning of this 1990 movie. So when she does, it's pivotal -- the audience understands that she's come to regard Edward as much more than a client. But even that kiss can't beat the one at the happy ending, after Edward \"rescues\" Vivian on her fire escape and she promises to \"rescue him right back.\" InStyle.com: Julia Roberts's Transformation . \"Ghost\" Technically, in this scene from the 1990 film, Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) is making out with Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg). But because Oda Mae is channeling Molly's late boyfriend Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze), it's Sam that Molly -- and the viewers -- get to see. \"Titanic\" Director James Cameron initially planned to cast \"an Audrey Hepburn type\" to play the female lead in this 1997 epic, and Leonardo DiCaprio nearly turned down his role. It's still captivating to see him woo Kate Winslet's Rose, even if, as DiCaprio said in a recent interview, kissing Kate is \"like kissing a family member.\" InStyle.com: Kate Winslet's Transformation . \"Spiderman\" The upside down kiss that Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) shared with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) in this 2002 flick was breath-taking for Maguire, but not for the reasons you might think. \"The whole time I had rainwater running up my nose,\" he said. \"Then, when Kirsten rolled back the mask, she cut my air off completely.\" \"Slumdog Millionaire\" It was easy to see why Jamal (Dev Patel) was so hung up on his childhood friend Latika (Freida Pinto). When they finally kiss on a Mumbai train platform, it's a moment as exuberantly optimistic as the goofy dance scene that follows. Bonus points for still being a couple to this off-screen day.

Water flowed on the surface of Mars as recently as 200,000 years ago, new research suggests. A young crater in the red planet's southern hemisphere contains well-preserved gullies and sediment deposits thought to have been formed by water. Scientists studying the crater estimated it to be no more than about 200,000 years old, so the water features must have appeared since then, the scientists claim. Scroll down for video... This photo shows debris flowing on Mars (top and bottom left). The Martian landforms were shown to be similar to  known debris flows on the Norwegian Svalbard islands in the Arctic Ocean (bottom right) The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. \u2018Gullies are common on Mars but the ones which have been studied previously are older, and the sediments where they have formed are associated with the most recent ice age,\u2019 said lead scientist Dr Andreas Johnsson, from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. \u2018Our study crater on Mars is far too young to have been influenced by the conditions that were prevalent then. The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. This is an artist's impression of what a lake on Mars may have looked like . Evidence of water on Mars dates back to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971. It revealed clues of water erosion in river beds and canyons as well as weather fronts and fogs. Viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys. Mars is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past. In June last year, Curiosity found Powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. \u2018This suggests that the melt water-related processes that formed these deposits have been exceptionally effective also in more recent times.\u2019 The crater had features that were characteristic of debris flows on Earth caused by material being carried and then deposited by fast-moving water. The Martian landforms were compared with known debris flows on the Norwegian Svalbard islands in the Arctic Ocean. \u2018Our fieldwork on Svalbard confirmed our interpretation of the Martian deposits,\u2019 said Dr Johnsson, whose findings appear in the scientific journal Icarus. \u2018What surprised us was that the crater in which these debris flows have formed is so young.\u2019 The study crater is located in the mid-latitudes of the Martian southern hemisphere and superimposed on the \u2018rampart ejecta\u2019 of a nearby larger crater.

Labour today comfortably held Feltham and Heston in the by-election with an increased majority over the Conservatives. Labour candidate Seema Malhotra was returned with a majority of 6,203 - a net swing of 8.6 per cent from the Conservatives. On a night which saw a turnout of under 29 per cent - the lowest in a by-election for 11 years - the Liberal Democrats managed to see off a challenge from the UK Independence Party to hold on to third place. Triumph: Labour candidate Seema Malhotra (centre) celebrates with her husband Sushil Saluja (front left) after winning the Feltham and Heston by-election in the early hours of this morning . The result came as a relief to Labour leader Ed Miliband who needed a victory if he was not to face a fresh bout of questioning over his leadership. He hailed the by-election success as a 'verdict on the Government's failed economic plan'. Addressing supporters in Feltham town centre, Mr Miliband called on the Tories to 'listen' to voters. He said: 'I think it is pretty offensive that the Conservatives are saying this morning \"Well, what do you expect? It's a traditional Labour area\". 'They shouldn't be denying the people's choice, they should be listening to the people's verdict. 'I think that is one of the things people really don't like about this government - that they don't listen. They really need to start listening. The triumphant candidate said her victory is a 'wake-up call' for Prime Minister David Cameron. Important message: Ms Malhotra delivers her winning speech as the unsuccessful candidates, Lib Dem Roger Crouch (centre) and Tory Mark Bowen (head bowed), listen on at the Civic Centre in Hounslow, west London . Ms Malhotra said: 'Even on a lower turnout we've increased substantially our majority and the Tories have got to be asking the question of why. 'This is a really important message that's been sent to Mr Cameron.' The Conservatives however said Labour . should have extended their majority even further if they were looking . to be on course for victory at the next general election, set for 2015. The defeated Tory candidate Mark Bowen insisted that he was 'proud' of the result, despite seeing his party's share of the vote fall. 'We have done a lot better than the pollsters and bookmakers suggested we would do,' he said. For the Lib Dems there was relief that they avoided the humiliation of being beaten into fourth place, despite a sharp fall in their share of the vote. Delight: Supporters celebrate Ms Malhotra's victory, which increased Labour's share of the vote from 43per cent at the general election to 54per cent . Lib Dem candidate Roger Crouch said: 'We have shown that we are still resilient and still relevant.' However Ukip leader Nigel Farage said the Lib Dems were 'almost a busted flush'. 'People are turning to Ukip as they realise we are serious when it comes to putting Britain first,' he said. Ukip had been hoping to overhaul the Lib Dems but admitted their chances had been damaged by David Cameron's decision to wield the veto at the Brussels summit, which gave the Tories a fillip in the final week of the campaign. Labour increased their share of the vote from 43per cent at the general election to 54per cent with a net swing of 8.6per cent from the Tories. The Conservative vote share was down from 34per cent to 28per cent, while the Lib Dems dropped from nearly 14per cent to under 6per cent. In contrast, Ukip saw its vote share more than double from 2per cent to over 5per cent.

Pauline Nyiramasuhuko, who is the only woman to be convicted by the court, was minister for family and women's affairs in the Rwandan government when some 800,000 people, mainly ethnic Tutsis, were killed in 1994. She was accused of direct and public incitement to commit genocide and of being responsible for rape \"as part of a widespread and systematic attack against a civilian population on political, ethnic and racial grounds,\" the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) said. Her son, Arsene Shalom Ntahobali, a militia leader who was jointly charged in the case, was also convicted Friday of genocide, crimes against humanity including rape and persecution and war crimes, and sentenced to life in prison. Four local officials who were accused alongside Nyiramasuhuko and her son were all found guilty of genocide and other charges. They were handed prison terms ranging from 25 years to life. Nyiramasuhuko, who was arrested in 1997 in Kenya, and taken to the U.N. court in Tanzania to await trial, was found guilty of seven of the counts she faced, ICTR spokesman Roland Amoussouga told CNN. They included charges of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity including rape and persecution. Two charges were dismissed, one of complicity to commit genocide and a second relating to murder and crimes against humanity. She was also cleared of two charges, one alleging direct and public incitement to commit genocide and another of inhumane acts and crimes against humanity. The court found that Nyiramasuhuko was a member of the Interim Government that issued directives whose intention \"was to encourage the population to hunt down and take action against the 'enemy' and its 'accomplices'; terms which referred to Tutsis in general.\" Nyiramasuhuko also participated in many Cabinet meetings at which the massacre of Tutsis was discussed, \"and she took part in the decisions that triggered the onslaught of massacres in Butare prefecture.\" Between April and mid-June 1994, hundreds of Tutsis were rounded up by militia members in her home district of Butare and many subjected to assaults and rape, the court said. During this time, Nyiramasuhuko ordered killings and \"aided and abetted rapes\" of vulnerable civilians, some of which were committed by her son, the court said. The six sentenced Friday will remain in detention in Tanzania pending an appeals process. If their convictions are upheld, the head of the tribunal will then decide what state to transfer them to to serve their sentences, said Amoussouga, the ICTR spokesman. The ICTR said it had been a complex and lengthy case, involving 189 witnesses and almost 13,000 pages of documents. While Nyiramasuhuko is the only woman to have been convicted by the ICTR, other women have been jailed for their roles in the genocide by courts elsewhere. A Roman Catholic nun was sentenced to 30 years in prison by a traditional Rwandan court in 2006 for her part in the killings. Two other Catholic nuns were found guilty of genocide charges by a court in Belgium in 2001. The Rwandan genocide was triggered by the April 6, 1994, shooting down of a plane carrying the nation's Hutu president. Ethnic violence erupted and Tutsis were killed systematically by Hutus. The United Nations estimates that some 200,000 people participated in the perpetration of the Rwandan genocide. In all, 800,000 men, women, and children -- mostly Tutsis but also moderate Hutus -- died.

Rooney, who died of natural causes at age 93 on Sunday, also did not want his stepson Chris Aber to attend his funeral, attorney Michael Augustine said. Rooney's wishes are the basis for a looming court fight over who controls the legendary actor's remains and makes funeral and burial decisions, Augustine said. While Rooney disinherited his children, his wife and all but one of her children in a will he signed just weeks before his death, court papers suggest there is not much in his estate to fight over. His personal property is valued at just $18,000 despite an unmatched 90-year film career. Augustine, who served as Rooney's conservator, said in a court filing that he believed Rooney's estranged wife, Jan Rooney, and her son, Christopher Aber, would attempt to remove Rooney's body from Forest Lawn Memorial Park's mortuary. A Los Angeles judge signed a handwritten order Tuesday preventing anyone from removing Rooney's remains until he holds a hearing on Friday. Augustine, who is named as estate executor in the will, is asking for that authority. Attorney Yevgeny Belous, who works with lawyer Mitchell Karasov to represent Jan Rooney, said she is the only person with authority to make the decisions. Lawyers for both sides are \"working toward the mutual goal of honoring Mickey,\" perhaps with an agreement on funeral and burial arrangements, before Friday's hearing, Belous said. \"We want Mickey to have a proper ceremony,\" he said. \"We don't want to drag this into a fight.\" Rooney already purchased burial plots in a cemetery in the Westlake Village area of Los Angeles County. In fact, Rooney's mother was moved there years ago so the family would be together, Belous said. Augustine said Rooney told him shortly before his death that he no longer wanted to be buried in the plot he purchased 15 years earlier. \"Substantial intervening events\" in the years since changed his wishes, but Rooney's lack of cash prevented him from purchasing a new burial plot, he said. Rooney expressed a desire to be interred at either a veteran's cemetery or a Hollywood cemetery with other stars. Hollywood Forever, the final resting place for Rudolph Valentino, Cecil B. DeMille and a long list of long gone show biz A-listers, is one possibility, Augustine said. Augustine said he doubts a deal can be made before the judge imposes a decision, since he is demanding that Aber be banned from the funeral because of Mickey Rooney's severe dislike for the stepson who previously managed him. Rooney won a $2.8 million judgment against Aber in a lawsuit that included accusations of elder abuse. Aber has yet to pay the judgment, Augustine said. Jan Rooney signed an agreement waiving all claims to her husband's estate after the couple separated in June 2012 after 34 years of marriage, according to a court filing. She will benefit from Rooney's Social Security and other pensions totaling $8,400 a month, Augustine said. While Rooney was the highest paid actor in Hollywood 70 years ago, his personal property totaled just $18,000, according to documents accompanying his will. Rooney: A spokesman against elder abuse . The will signed by Rooney on March 11, 2014, left the entire estate to stepson Mark Rooney, one of Jan Rooney's sons, who was the actor's caretaker the last two years of his life. Rooney \"intentionally omitted\" and disinherited his eight surviving biological children and two other stepchildren from his last marriage, the will said. Rooney had no negative feelings toward his surviving children, but they were all financially better off than he was, Augustine said. He believed what little he had to leave should go to Mark Rooney and his wife, because they had been taking good care of him in the final two years, Augustine said. None of the others \"ever changed one of Mickey's Depends,\" Augustine said. A probate hearing is scheduled for May 12 to start the process of probating the actor's will."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mickey Rooney, who died at 93, didn't want to be buried in a pre-bought plot or have stepson Chris Aber at his funeral, causing a court dispute.

Officers reached him just before 11am today as he was trying to get across the carriageway with traffic speeding towards him. Police said that the man was cold and very distressed but physically unhurt. They gave him a lift back to the Brighton hotel he is staying at. Motorist Sarah Peck, who saw the man being rescued, said: 'He was sitting in his vehicle speaking to a police officer. 'He looked confused and bewildered, but was being looked after.

Dramatic video showed tiny Azra Karaduman being carried by rescuers to a vehicle that would take her to the hospital. They were holding a mask over her mouth to help give her oxygen. Later, rescuers pulled the girl's mother and paternal grandmother alive from the rubble as well. Officials said the 2-week-old girl's father remained trapped somewhere under the debris of the multiple-story building. Over several hours, four corpses were pulled from the rubble of the same building, officials said. At least one of them was male. Officials did not say immediately whether one of the bodies was the baby's father. The official death toll jumped to 459 Tuesday, with another 1,352 people injured, the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Relief Agency said. Teams of rescuers throughout the poor region struck by Sunday's 7.2-magnitude quake are searching for survivors around the clock. Reaching Azra -- who, according to her maternal grandmother, was born three weeks prematurely -- was particularly difficult, rescuers told CNN. The baby's mother managed to make contact with rescuers and get the baby to them through a narrow passage, a rescuer said. Officials had to find a rescuer thin enough to fit into the crevice to get Azra. The rescuer told CNN it was the first time he had ever pulled someone alive from earthquake rubble in 12 years of doing such work. While rescuers worked to get to the mother and grandmother, they managed to supply the two women with oxygen, officials said. \"It was hard to rescue them\" because of the tight space, said rescue worker Tansu Bayram. \"It was so difficult.\" Some 2,262 buildings in the region lie in ruins. The military is assisting rescue workers, who are using heavy machinery, shovels, and their bare hands. Numerous aftershocks -- the largest a magnitude 6.0 -- have rattled the area, which is one of the poorest in Turkey. One on Tuesday measured 5.7, and was 7 km (4.3 miles) deep. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 55 buildings collapsed in Ercis on the north shore of Lake Van. The Turkish Red Crescent said about 25 apartment buildings and a student dormitory also collapsed in the town. A health services building also collapsed, along with part of a hospital, CNN sister network CNN Turk reported. The injured were being treated in the hospital's garden. \"People are really scared,\" CNN Turk reporter Nevsin Mengu said from Van on Monday. \"The survivors are now trying to survive the cold weather.\" Rescuers and survivors contended with near-freezing temperatures. Some people collected wood from collapsed buildings to burn for warmth, Mengu said. She said many residents are not returning to their houses, opting instead to sleep on rooftops or in the streets. It was not clear whether their homes were uninhabitable or if they were just too frightened. Are you there? Submit your pictures or video . The Red Crescent called for rescue workers, machinery and drinking water. A crisis center was set up by the country's Health Ministry in the Turkish capital of Ankara.

It may sound far-fetched, but a California man says he lived a real life spy thriller when he became an unlikely secret agent. Fernando Jara, of Kern County, spent five years completely off the grid beginning in 2001 when the seemingly normal guy joined the ranks of America's most clandestine agency. It was shortly after the September 11 attacks when Jara, who had recently converted to Islam, sent an email to the CIA, offering his services as a spy. To his surprise, the feds got back to him, and offered him the job, Jara told the Los Angeles Times. He had dropped out of high school, and at the time was working toward his equivalency degree at community college. Jara quickly got to work, traveling within California and to Virginia and Washington, DC, where he received training in Arabic, counter-terror tactics and weapons. He was also connected with David Manning of Ventura, California, who taught the then-26-year-old how to handle knives and guns. Manning told the LA Times: 'They said he was under the radar and getting ready to go to Afghanistan to infiltrate the Taliban. I told them, \"I'm not doing this.\" I didn't believe them.' Jara credits Manning with turning him into 'a one-man army.' The next five years of Jara's life have remained a pretty guarded secret, but he tells the LA Times that he infiltrated numerous terror training camps in Yemen and Afghanistan while posing as a radical Muslim. The paper reached out to the FBI and CIA for comment on Jara, but both agencies declined to comment.

After several years in the spy game, . Jara's cover was exposed in a Yemen bar when a fellow patron said that . he was either a combatant or a foreign intelligence official. After that incident, Jara was ordered to escape Yemen. Upon his return to the U.S., things began to go downhill for Jara, who had developed signs of post-traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism.

He had been shot twice in the head while sitting in the passenger seat of his Range Rover before the vehicle - with his body inside it - was torched. Now a private investigation by his family has revealed that there are several 'persons of interest' in Britain who need to be questioned. The family of murdered Briton Oliver Gobat (pictured left with his sister-in-law Alexandra See) believes the British government is hampering the investigation in to his death . However, because of a diplomatic deadlock involving the UK and St Lucia authorities, they have not been quizzed over the death and Britain has yet to send its own police officers to the island. Mr Gobat\u2019s brother Adam is quoted in The Times as saying: \u2018We\u2019re hoping that this new information can persuade the UK government to take action. \u2018Inaction is damnable. Inaction is almost tantamount to the government protecting people who may be part of this, or who may have relevant information.\u2019 The Foreign Office is reportedly refusing to accept an invitation from St Lucia authorities for British police to travel to the Commonwealth country to help with the investigation as it wants assurances that the killers will not receive the death penalty. The Times says foreign office minister Hugo Swire told MPs earlier this week that he would look to find a way of overcoming the diplomatic barriers and that he 'pressed the issue' with the island's high commissioner recently. Oliver Gobat, 38, was shot twice in the head before being doused with petrol and set alight in his Range Rover (pictured) Mr Gobat's parents Theo and Helen Gobat have launched a private investigation into the suspected contract killing. The couple have put up a \u00a360,000 reward in a last ditch attempt to try and find his killers. The manner of Mr Gobat\u2019s death, on a remote track a mile from the upmarket Cap Maison hotel he ran in the north of the island, has led police to believe he was the victim of a contract killing. Police sources previously stated Mr Gobat\u2019s death was \u2018no ordinary murder\u2019 and it had \u2018all the hallmarks of a professional killing\u2019. Paradise: Cap Maison's estate of luxury apartments and hotel in the Caribbean once run by Mr Gobat . The boutique hotel, pictured, is five star and is based on the coast of the island . Cap Maison, a five-star boutique hotel set in the lush tropical grounds of a former sugar plantation on the northern tip of the island, was created by the Gobats with their three sons Rufus, Adam and Oliver. Guests, who have included Amy Winehouse and Kelly Brook, stay in colonial-style villas and every luxury is on tap, including valets, private chefs, a walk-in wine cellar and spa. Theo Gobat, 75, was born in Chester and trained as an accountant and moved to St Lucia in 1974 as finance director of a hotel and travel company which then went bankrupt. He and another director successfully took over the company's hotels and eventually created the small, upmarket Cap Maison. His son Oliver was born in St Lucia but had dual nationality. He represented Surrey juniors at cricket and attended Leeds University, before moving to Australia to help launch a health and fitness club in Adelaide, Australia."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Oliver Gobat, a British hotelier running Cap Maison in St Lucia, was murdered.

A woman juror who abandoned a four-week robbery trial to jet off on holiday to Malta was jailed last night for 56 days for contempt of court. Janet Chapman, 51, said she thought it would fine to travel abroad for a week because her doctor had signed her off work due to a bad back. The next day she phoned the court and left a telephone message saying: \u2018Hello, this is Janet Chapman.... I won\u2019t be attending court for a period of up to two weeks. 'I have got to return to the doctor\u2019s next Tuesday. I have got sciatica. Thankyou. Bye.\u2019 She then flew off to enjoy some winter sun on a \u00a3669 week-long holiday in Malta with her long-time partner Raymond Pritchard. But she had a nasty surprise when she touched down at Liverpool Airport as a welcoming party of police officers was waiting to arrest her. Judge Anthony Russell QC said: \u2018It is clear you deliberately deceived the court for your own ends and pleasure. \u2018Your assertion that you were unaware that you could not go away on holiday whilst absent from jury duty due to what you maintain was illness is ludicrous. \u2018I am satisfied that if you really . suffered back pain of such severity that that you could not continue . your jury service you would not have been able to endure the travel to . Malta. \u2018I am driven to the . conclusion that you pretended to your doctor that you had a back problem . in order that you could take a holiday in Malta.\u2019 Busted: Chapman was caught after an official at Preston Crown court noticed she had called from a foreign number . Preston Crown Court heard potential jurors were told to indicate if they had a holiday or hospital admission which would leave them unable to sit on a serious robbery trial. At the start of the trial of robbery suspect Raymond Mallen, Chapman did not notify the court why she should not be part of the jury. He was accused of being part of an organised gang which carried out a . series of high value cash-in-transit robberies across the North West of . England. Evidence had been . heard and Judge Stuart Baker was about to begin summing up when Chapman . phoned the courts and left her message. Yesterday . she told the court the holiday last month had been a birthday surprise . from her partner and she had only learned about the trip the night . before they flew out. Chapman, a deputy manager at a children\u2019s residential home, said that having suffered a back injury and been signed off sick from work she didn\u2019t think she would have to attend the trial. She said: \u2018On the Monday morning I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. I went to the doctor that night. I was signed off for a week. I didn\u2019t think I was doing anything wrong.\u2019 Surprise: Chapman's partner, Raymond Pritchard, told the court he had booked the \u00a3669 holiday in January, but had not told her about it until the night before . Her partner, Raymond Pritchard, told the court he booked the \u00a3669 holiday in January, but had not told her about it until the night before. Judge Russell said it had been a serious contempt of court. He said: \u2018You have manifestly failed to perform your public duty. Further, it is clear that you deliberately deceived the court for your own ends and pleasure, namely taking a holiday in Malta.\u2019 The case carried on and Mallen was convicted of conspiracy to rob and jailed 12 years. Various gang members have now been jailed for a total of more than 80 years in all. Last night Mr Pritchard choked back tears at his semi-detached property on the outskirts of Blackpool and said the mistake would cost them dear.. He said: \u2018Obviously we did not know what the consequences would be. I have never stepped into a court of any kind until today. This could well lose my wife her job. She works with children and it is a job she loves. \u2018Janet has never done anyone any harm. Then to come home from holiday and get arrested at the airport, it was terrible. I have not heard from her since she was jailed I don\u2019t know when she will be able to phone me. \u2018I think what has happened is like using a jack hammer to crack a nut.

This is the moment an innocent puffin trying to feed its young was robbed by a greedy gull. Having scoured the Northumbrian coast for food, the helpless victim had not noticed a predator watching from a nearby rock. It was not until he hit the jackpot and set off for home clutching a batch of five sand eels that the gull made its move. Success: With a batch of sand eels in its iconic beak the doting parent gets ready to head home . Coast seems clear: He sets off, clutching the meal. Not far from his roost, it shouldn't be a long flight . Noticing a second too late, the puffin tried to change course. But the bigger bird was ready. In an alarming display of survival-of-the-fittest, the pair tumbled to the ground of the Farne Islands in a bid to win the meal. The incredible scene, captured by amateur photographer Steve Evans, escalated on dry land. The determined puffin made a run for it on foot. And despite being apprehended by the savvy gull, all was not lost for the breadwinner who proudly walked away with one of the two remaining fish. Puffin enthusiast Mr Evans, 50, said: 'I saw the gull spot the puffin whilst on a rocky outcrop, as it took to the air, the puffin saw it and tried to change direction. Shock: Out of nowhere a giant predator swoops. The black-headed gull tries to turn to grab the eels . Attacked: The puffin had caught some sand eels off the coast of the Farne Islands in Northumbria . 'The gull attempted to hood its wings around the puffin and pecked at its fish-laden bill. 'The gull managed to dislodge a small sand eel, as this dropped from the air another bird spotted it and got to it before the gull. 'The gull managed to get a fish from the puffin, once this happened the gull seemed to leave the puffin alone. 'It got back to its burrow with some fish intact.' Puffins are phenomenal swimmers and hunters as they adopt a flying technique under water. In the air, they beat their . wings rapidly, over 400 times-per-minute. Plan B: The tussle moves to dry land where the determined puffin tries to leg it with his food still intact . Relieved but exhausted: Usually known for its speed, this puffin only took home some of his earnings . The black-headed gull is an arch-nemesis of the Atlantic Puffin breed, which resides in the British Isles. To avoid danger, the black and white auks tend to fly together in confusing formations. Their fast pace and stark colours alarm predators. Fascinated by these black and white creatures, known for their super-fast swimming technique, Mr Evans from Wakefield, Yorkshire, planned this photography expedition months ago. Lucky: During the tussle a nearby tern made off with one of the prized snacks as the gull and puffin fought away . He said: 'For many years I have had an interest in the outdoors and the countryside, working several dogs on large Yorkshire estates. 'I have always had a liking for Puffins, this comical bird, but wanted to . photograph them during the breeding season when they spend time on land.' Lundy Island, the largest island in the Bristol Channel, near Devon, is named after the Norse word for 'puffin' Puffins are the symbol of Newfound and Labrador province in Canada, and the namesake of Lundy Island (from 'lund', the Norse word for puffin). The iconic birds are still hunted and eaten in the Faroe Islands and Iceland. There are three types of puffin, which are members of the auk family. The Tufted Puffin, an almost black creature, is native to the North Pacific. The Horned Puffin, with a fleshy horn above its beak, resides in cold climates like Siberia and Alaska. The Atlantic Puffin, or 'common puffin', is native to the North Atlantic and the British Isles. Puffins are known for their ability to swim. They soar through the water, flapping their wings as if flying through the air.

They were the ones who suggested as early as Monday morning that Liverpool were about to come to the Bernabeu and stick their reserves out. Nobody believed the story but in the end they were right, which prompts a question for Liverpool supporters. What is more worrying \u2014 the fact that your manager\u2019s team plans are being leaked to the press in your opponent\u2019s home town or that he should make a decision laced with such staggering lack of ambition in the first place? Brendan Rodgers applauds the travelling fans at full time after Liverpool's defeat by Real Madrid . Steven Gerrard (left) started the game on the bench and came on as a sub for Lucas Leiva . Raheem Sterling (left, tussling with Cristiano Ronaldo) was another star who started on the bench . Brendan Rodgers decided to makes seven changes for Tuesday night's clash against Real Madrid. Only Simon Mignolet, Martin Skrtel, Alberto Moreno and Joe Allen survived from the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle at the weekend. Liverpool starting XI v Newcastle: . Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno, Sterling, Allen, Gerrard, Henderson, Coutinho, Balotelli . Liverpool starting XI v Real Madrid: . Mignolet, Manquillo, Toure, Skrtel , Moreno; Can, Lucas 7; Lallana, Allen, Markovic; Borini . Most of those standing flummoxed in the away section high up in the gods here last night were perhaps past caring about the small details by kick off. The decision had been made and Liverpool, as a result, were finished before they even began. This was sport, but only in name. It is hard to win at Madrid. Since 1957, only one English team apart from Liverpool has managed it. Arsenal in 2006. The key fact here, though, is that the others have come to this magnificent stadium and tried. To return to an earlier point, that is called sport. You turn up, take a deep breath, put your gloves on or your shin pads and you go out and try to do something special. Bobby Robson tried with Ipswich here in 1973 and got a draw. Brian Clough lost 5-1 with Derby after winning a European Cup first leg 4-1. He went home with a broken heart and a sense of injustice but at least he tried, just as David O\u2019Leary did in losing 3-2 with Leeds in 2001.

CLICK HERE for DOMINIC KING'S ratings from the Bernabeu to find out how the surprise Liverpool starters fared . His team led that night. Only for a minute, but just imagine what that minute must have felt like. We could go on. We could talk about narrow failures here for both Manchester teams. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers can dress this team selection up all he likes. He can call it pragmatic or realistic but it is neither of those things, really. It just felt fundamentally wrong and the fact that the defeat was narrow and the performance spirited does not change that. The result should not serve as vindication of Rodgers\u2019 methods. The scoreline was a fluke, reflective not of Real\u2019s clear dominance but of the fact that Liverpool\u2019s lack of competitiveness almost sent their opponents to sleep. Emre Can (right) was a surprise starter for Liverpool but failed to impress in Madrid . Fabio Borini started up front for Liverpool in place of Mario Balotelli . 137 - The seven players on the Liverpool bench had made 137 Champions League appearances between them prior to kick-off last night. That\u2019s seven more than the number made by the players in their starting XI. 130 -\u00a0The number of Champions League appearances made by Liverpool\u2019s starting XI. 642 - The number of Champions League appearances made by Real Madrid\u2019s starting XI. \u00a359 -The cost of an away ticket at Bernabeu last night. Not to mention the added cost of flights and hotels. 27 - Shots at goal by Madrid last night. That\u2019s 13 more than they managed in their 3-0 win at Anfield. 2 - Minutes played by Steven Gerrard at the Bernabeu prior to last night. He was a sub in a 1-0 win in 2009. He has now played a total of 23 minutes at the stadium. 3,669 - Tickets at the Bernabeu allocated to Liverpool fans. Rodgers\u2019 team selection will have disappointed many who made the 1,796-mile round-trip. The game was played in an almost dreamlike atmosphere, as though Madrid knew they would win. When they scored, in the 27th minute, the roof hardly came off the place. By half-time, Real had taken 13 shots on goal to Liverpool\u2019s none. That is not what we hoped for when the draw threw these two great clubs together. Afterwards, Rodgers\u2019 stated belief in his own methods was impressive enough. It is a relevant quality. He has not done much wrong since arriving at Anfield two summers ago but this selection flew quite spectacularly in the face of all he has preached. Back then he talked romantically about sitting on the floor of his grandfather\u2019s house watching great Liverpool European nights on TV. What he will not have watched is Bob Paisley sending his stiffs out. Back then they didn\u2019t even get on the plane, never mind the pitch. Real are a very good football team. They were not the best team in Spain last season, though. Or, indeed, the second best.\u00a0They lost five times, including twice at home. Brendan Rodgers made seven changes to the team that started on the weekend against Newcastle . Adam Lallana (centre) grew into the game as it went on and justified his starting place . They have improved since then and were far too good for Liverpool two weeks ago. In Rodgers\u2019 mind, though, they have been clearly been built up in to a monster. He obviously believes them to be unbeatable and perhaps that is the greatest sin of all. No manager \u2014 in any sport \u2014 should ever think that. If we all thought that way, we may as well scrap the FA Cup. This was, in effect, a team selection designed principally to avoid collateral damage that may affect an entirely different game \u2014 against Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League \u2014 that is still three days away. And if that is the way a manager thinks, what chance do his players have? Results can change seasons. Just one result. Who knows? For Liverpool, this could have been the one. Liverpool fans who traveled to the Bernabeu may question Rodgers' decision to play a weakened team . Simon Mingolet (centre) rises to collect a cross and deny Cristiano Ronaldo an effort at goal . Instead, Liverpool now look like a team who feel they don\u2019t belong in Europe, a team who arrive at the really big venues seeking purely to avoid a hiding. Rodgers, meanwhile, must wait and see what this does for his own reputation \u2014 even if he claimed last night not to care. Just two weeks ago, the Liverpool manager told another Spanish newspaper \u2014 AS \u2014 that he would like to work over here one day. He may be waiting a while after this.

Music affiliates that will reportedly appear on an album, also titled Cruel Summer, set for release sometime this year. Reactions to the music have been overwhelmingly positive, with MTV calling it \"rocking\" and GQ senior editor Logan Hill tweeting from the premiere that the music \"was the best part -- big complex production, huge beats.\" The Hollywood Reporter noted multiple instances of chair-dancing in the audience. Response to the film has also been generally warm. The Los Angeles Times film blog 24 Frames wrote, \"The story is secondary to the pyrotechnics, with new music from West and a thumping surround-sound quality that makes a 3D Michael Bay effort feel like an iPad short.\" Vulture, meanwhile, praised West's \"great visual sense\" and noted the effectiveness of the special camera rig invented for the film to incorporate all seven screens, whether it was stretching a single shot across multiple screens or having each display a different image/angle during a single scene. \"The movie is all Kanye's vision -- his images, his music and costumes he designed, mixed with pieces by local Arabian designers,\" wrote Jada Yuan. \"He put it together in two-and-a-half months with only four days of actual shooting.\" In a speech following the film, West said, \"I was very particular about having the screens be separate and having it where your mind puts the screens back together -- the way you can put memories together, the way that happens throughout the day and it all links back up.\" Vulture also managed to score a comment from one of the many stars in attendance, Jay-Z. \"It's about the things that separate us -- race and class in society and things like that. But the only thing that really binds us is true love,\" he said. West said he will keep working on and improving the film, and he plans to bring it to Qatar and New York in the future. \"I'm not the best director in the world or anything like that, but I had an idea,\" said West during his post-film speech. \"I could dream of, one day, this being the way that people watch movies, in this form where it surrounds you and people want to go back and see it more and more because they missed something else to the left and missed something else to the right, and it felt more like the experience of life.\" See the full story at RollingStone.com.

A teenager who almost died during a GCSE exam when he suffered a heart attack at his desk was banned from collecting his results - because he had an outstanding \u00a35.60 lunch bill. Teachers told schoolboy Ryan Swinburn he could not have his exam grades until he paid for the pizza and baguette he had eaten months earlier. The 16-year-old had been unable to settle the canteen bill after he was rushed into hospital with multiple organ failure, having recently been diagnosed with cardiolipin syndrome. He was discharged from hospital in time to sit his GCSEs but almost died in May when he suffered a cardiac arrest during a maths exam. But he was shocked when he went to school to collect his results last month and was told they were being withheld because of the outstanding lunch debt. Ryan, from Rugby, Warwickshire, said: 'It was all a bit ludicrous really. 'I\u2019ve had a tough time and because I wasn\u2019t at school I wasn\u2019t able to pay the bill. 'One of my teachers slyly told me I had got a C when I got there on the day so it really got me excited to see whether I had done the same in any other subjects. 'But when my head of year told me I couldn\u2019t have them until I had settled a mere \u00a35.60 - I was shocked.

He was forced to spend three months in hospital undergoing dialysis and taking a daily cocktail of powerful steroids to control his condition. Incredibly, the dedicated teenager battled to become well enough to sit his GCSEs in May but was rushed back to hospital after collapsing just minutes after starting the first exam. The school agreed to award Ryan, who wants to study psychology and sociology at A-Level, his GCSEs based on his mock exam results and predicted grades. But when he went to school on August 31 to collect his results he was turned away at the door until he paid the canteen bill. He walked home and returned with his fuming mother Deborah Harris, 44, who stormed back to the school to demand an explanation. She said: 'Settling a \u00a35 bill was the last thing on his mind - he has been seriously ill in hospital.

For millions of holidaymakers, it is an online bible that helps them to pick the best hotels \u2013 and avoid the worst. But one Hebridean guest house owner claims some of the candid hotel and restaurant reviews posted by users around the world on Trip-Advisor have harmed his business. Now former college lecturer Richard Gollin is to sue the world's largest travel website in a landmark case. He claims false and negative postings on the website have driven away potential customers. Mr Gollin, who runs the six-bedroomed\u00a0 beachside Baille na Cille guest house at an idyllic spot in Uig on the west coast of Lewis, claims some of the negative criticism about his business should have been removed by TripAdvisor. He is taking on the might of the international travel guide, which is valued on the US stock exchange at more than \u00a32billion, over suspected malicious postings he says hit his income. In a David and Goliath battle, Mr Gollin, 64, has begun a small claims action at Stornoway Sheriff Court. He believes the website is rife with inaccurate or false guest reviews. Postings include one from a guest who criticised the food and claimed visitors were under-fed. Another review included criticism of extra charges for a phone bill. Mr Gollin said: 'We are the most smallest, westerly remote guest house in Britain and we are taking on one of the largest travel guide companies. 'False criticisms': Baille na Cille has been 'hurt' by postings that Mr Gollin says should have been removed from the travel guide . 'I believe TripAdvisor is in dereliction . of duty in failing to have proper supervision of what goes on their . website. All across the country people should stand up to TripAdvisor.' Mr Gollin claims he has lost bookings as a result of negative and false postings and is seeking compensation from the US-based firm. On TripAdvisor, Mr Gollin's B&B has a mark of four stars out of five, with 41 out of 50 people rating it as 'very good' or 'excellent'. But some people have made complaints: . One user wrote: 'It is in a stunning location however the room was freezing cold and there was no hot water to have a wash.' Another wrote: 'Found the owner patronising and pompous.' Another user said: 'The dining room decor was distateful (sic) to us - filled with war memorabilia. The room was clean, but horribly ordinary.'

Londoners Mr Gollin and his wife Joanna, 52, the guest house chef, came to Lewis on honeymoon in the late 1970s and later relocated permanently. Mr Gollin worked as a business studies lecturer at Lews Castle College in Stornoway before leaving to concentrate on the guest house. He said: 'Anyone can go on the TripAdvisor site and within two minutes could post a fake review about the Ritz Hotel in London, for example, without even being there \u2013 they could just make it up.' Mr Gollin said he asked TripAdvisor to remove false postings but claims the company ignored him. The negative comments posted on the reviews website referred to the meals, the age of the building, the host himself and the beds. TripAdvisor insists in court submissions it is not subject to the law in Scotland and its legal team, from its Massachusetts headquarters, has instructed Stornoway lawyer Angus Macdonald. He is asking Sheriff David Sutherland to throw the case out of court, claiming it is outwith Scottish jurisdiction. Mr Gollin was originally representing himself but has now hired lawyer Duncan Burd. Court papers were lodged yesterday but the case has been continued to a later date. TripAdvisor, owned by the Expedia travel website firm, is valued at \u00a32.3billion.

Former disgraced New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was spotted over the weekend attending the Dartmouth reunion of his younger girlfriend Lis Smith. Smith, who is 31, graduated from the Ivy League school in 2005. According to Page Six, Spitzer, who graduated from Princeton in 1981, was apparently seen circulating at a frat party on Friday night too. The former New York Governor was forced to resign from his post in 2008 after spending more than $15,000 on prostitutes. He has also recently finalized a very public and bitter divorce from Silda Wall Spitzer. Public: Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer is standing by his gal pal Lis Smith. The couple were seen at a Dartmouth reunion over the weekend . The once-covert couple have now clearly let go of any attempts to keep their private lives private. Spitzer had a failed political 'comeback' campaign to become New York City's new comptroller last year, masterminded by Smith. She then joined Bill de Blasio's team and was widely considered to be the likely candidate for the mayor's press secretary. Just as the final staffing decision was due to be made, photos were released that showed the former governor, who resigned years ago after admitting to soliciting prostitutes, sneaking in and out of Smith's Soho apartment in December. Back to school: Spitzer, who graduated from Princeton in 1981, was even seen circulating at a Psi Upsilon frat party on Friday . Now after spending the past few months under the radar, Smith is actively trying to restart her consulting career. She is now working for the Democratic Governor's Association, paying close attention to Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland who is considered a possible 2016 candidate should Hillary Clinton choose not to run for president. Spitzer was introduced to his new girlfriend's family over Christmas and the couple took a romantic trip to Jamaica over the New Year - which reportedly included an amorous session inside an outdoor hot-tub. Spitzer, who was once considered a future presidential candidate, met his wife Silda at Harvard Law School in 1987. The couple had three daughters as Spitzer rose the ranks from successful lawyer to prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Silda Wall Spitzer recently received a $7.5million payout and to keep her luxury Fifth Avenue apartment overlooking Central Park in Manhattan as part of her divorce settlement. The ex-New York governor's former wife grimly stood by him when his predilection for expensive call girls came to light in 2008. She will also receive $240,000-a-year maintenance for life. The Spitzers divorce was finalized in February this year and it was agreed that Silda would receive the first $1million within 180 days. Another $1million will follow on the service of their divorce judgement and then at least $500,000 ever year unless the former politician decides to pay his ex a lump sum. The annual $240,000 maintenance payment will come to Silda after her former husband has paid the taxes. It will continue until she either remarries or dies.

Salons are using beds three times as hot as the Australian outback \u2013 putting unsuspecting clients at risk of serious skin conditions such as cancer. In the worst cases, sunbeds breached the legal limit by as much as three times, emitting UV rays too hot to ever occur on earth. Many salons are using sunbeds three times as hot as the Australian Outback - putting users at risk of skin cancer - an investigation by Trading Standards has revealed . Tanning salons, hairdressers and nail bars with sunbeds caused the most concern, while sunbeds in gyms were found to have much higher levels of compliance. Now, even the tanning industry has joined calls for tougher action against rogue operators. The latest shock figures come from North Yorkshire County Council's Trading Standards department - but there are fears the problem could be nationwide. The report revealed that 75 per cent of sunbeds failed to meet the legal limit for an acceptable level of UV radiation. Undercover officers found sunbeds emitting radiation at between 1.5 and 2.5 times the legal limit - a level hotter than the sun in the Australian Outback. The investigation began after complaints from customers that the tanning beds were too hot. It involved Trading Standards officers donning protective radiation suits to check UV levels. Tests carried out earlier this year in West Yorkshire found 89 per cent of beds failed to meet the legal safety limit. Lamps in sunbeds can use a level of UV no more powerful than the legal limit of 0.3 watts per square metre, which is the equivalent of the sun on a hot day in Spain. However, investigations in Wakefield, Bradford, Kirklees, Leeds, and Calderdale revealed some sunbeds were belting out 0.9 watts per square metre, a level of solar energy too hot ever to be found on earth. Some beds were pumping out 0.9 watts per square metre, three times the legal limit and a level of UV radiation too hot ever to be found on earth . Similarly, an inspection of all the sunbeds in North Tyneside carried out in March  found that eight out of 10 sunbed salons failed to comply with the rules. The average level of radiation they found was 0.49 watts per square metre, with at least one bed emitting 1.18 watts. Officials underlined that while 0.3 watts can be compared with a hot day on the beach in the Mediterranean, 0.9 watts is completely off the scale. The Trading Standards investigation began after complaints from customers that the tanning beds were too hot . Clare Forbes, of West Yorkshire County Council's Trading Standards department said: 'Such levels of UV radiation do not occur anywhere on the earth's surface. Not even 0.6 occurs anywhere on earth.' A Trading Standards officer for North Yorkshire County council said the beds that failed the tests were all suspended from use until the bulbs were repaired or replaced. Officers will now expand the survey to cover the whole county. They added: 'As we move into autumn officers warned people who may be tempted to use sunbeds to maintain their holiday tan, that they may be risking serious skin damage and worse.' Gary Lipman, Chairman of The Sunbed Association, joined in calls for further regulation to keep the public safe. He said: 'We welcome North Yorkshire County Council's efforts to ensure sunbed businesses are operating within the law. 'Our Code of Practice requires our members to operate to best practise but beyond our membership we are aware that not all tanning businesses operate to such high standards. 'We very much hope that now these tests have been taken, the Council uses its powers to ensure compliance, so that all sunbed businesses are operating on a level playing field. 'Only the local authority has the powers to ensure compliance and where this is properly enforced across the board, experience dictates that the vast majority of salons comply. 'We would encourage the Council to take swift action against any salon that resists compliance. 'We would always recommend that anyone looking to use a sunbed, seeks out a member of The Sunbed Association, where they are assured of receiving correct advice and information from properly trained staff about responsible tanning.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Trading Standards investigations found high failure rates in sunbed safety tests across North Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and North Tyneside.

Under hostile questioning from MPs, the chief executive \u2013 who is paid more \u00a3100,000-a-year \u2013 said he was 'sorry' for every case where service standards had not been met. But he denied presiding over an organisation in chaos - and insisted a backlog of around 480,000 cases was 'work in progress'. Apology: The head of the Passport Office, Paul Pugh gives evidence to Commons Home Affairs Committee at Portcullis House in London . Asked about images leaked by a whistle-blower, which showed boxes of passport applications piled up in Liverpool, Mr Pugh said the picture showed a 'well ordered, well controlled' holding area. He also defended the decision to launch a 'witch hunt' investigation to find the whistle-blower \u2013 saying anybody who had 'unauthorised contact with the media' must be identified. During a stormy session before Westminster's home affairs committee, Mr Pugh was repeatedly accused of putting holiday-makers summer holiday plans in jeopardy. Last week alone, 16,500 of the 165,000 passports that were issued were sent out late. Committee chairman Keith Vaz asked: 'Would you like to take this opportunity to apologise to all those who have been waiting? 'I have a sheaf of letters from members of the public, from members of parliament, who are very, very angry. You don't seem to recognise the fact that people are very upset and angry. Would you like to apologise?' Grilling: During a stormy session before Westminster's home affairs committee, Mr Pugh was repeatedly accused of putting holiday-makers summer holiday plans in jeopardy . Mr Pugh replied: 'I absolutely . recognise the anger and distress that some people have suffered and I . would like to put on record that yes, in every case where we haven't met . our service standards, where we haven't been able to meet the . customer's needs, yes, certainly, we are sorry for that.' 'Mr . Vaz, who revealed he had been forced to personally text the Home . Secretary to sort out the case of one constituent, asked: 'We can take . that as an apology?' 'Mr Pugh, who promised not to take a bonus next year, replied: 'It is an apology.' 'Labour MP Paul Flynn asked Mr Pugh if he had considered resigning, since that was what members of the public hit by the debacle would want.' 'He said he had considered quitting but it was his responsibility to lead the Passport Office through 'tough times. Mr Pugh denied a surge in citizenship approvals to migrants, who can then apply for their first passport, was to blame for the problem. 'He also insisted the decision to stop issuing passports from Britain's embassies overseas was not to blame. However, he admitted forecasts on the impact this decision would have had proved wrong. 'Officials had predicted an extra 350,000 cases would be dealt with in Britain. In fact, the figure was likely to be closer to 400,000. 'Mr Pugh could soon be facing a new crisis, MPs were told, as union leaders threaten to order a walkout at the Passport Office. Mike Jones, Home Office group secretary at the PCS Union, said senior officials wanted up to 600 new jobs and pay rises for their members. He said that, if managers do not open negotiations, the union could ballot for industrial action. Labour MP Ian Austin warned him this would cause severe inconvenience to 'hard-working families' who deserve a summer break. Mr Pugh said a strike would be 'extremely damaging to our customers and our public.' 'He denied claims by the PCS that a reduction of around 550 in the number of staff working in the Passport Office between 2010 and 2014 was to blame'In comments likely to infuriate the union, he said that, four years ago, some staff did not have enough work to do and would spend their days 'reading books'. Mr Jones said the Passport Office had 'lost control' of the backlog.' He said that at June this year the number of applications logged as work-in-progress stood at 493,289, up from 289,892 in March. This compares to 146,586 applications in June last year and 72,586 in March 2013.' 'MPs were frustrated that Mr Pugh had failed to deliver his own detailed figures to the committee.

Mrs Clinton - a potential presidential candidate for 2016 - made her differences with Mr Obama clear. But, though the suggestion was made, she did not go so far as to say whether different foreign policy could have prevented the rise of jihadist militants now causing chaos in Syria and Iraq. In a TV interview she said: 'We pushed very hard. But as I say in my book, I believe that Harry Truman was right, the buck stops with the president'. Scroll down for video . Not our fault; Clinton said the decision to yank American troops out of Iraq, taken while she was secretary of state, belonged to Iraq itself, not to the U.S. Clinton, who is on the fence about running for president in 2016, fielded questions moderated by CNN's Christiane Amanpour while wearing a Ralph Lauren suit . Mrs Clinton, a former secretary of state, said she joined forces with Pentagon and CIA chiefs to persuade Obama to arm rebels opposing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but that the White House resisted. Speaking on CNN, she said: 'It's very difficult, in retrospect, to say that would have prevented this.' The former secretary of state, senator and first lady has been offering views that differ from Obama's on foreign policy in recent months, including on issues such as Iran's nuclear program and dealings with Russian president Vladimir Putin. However, she stood by the President in another segment of the interviewing, suggesting that Mr Obama bears no responsibility for his decision to pull American troops out of . Iraq at the end of 2011. That decision, which created a power vacuum in the country, has also contributed to the rise of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) militants. 'In retrospect, that was a mistake by the Iraqi government,' she said.

American servicemen and women in Iraq as a stabilizing force after 2011. Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki reportedly balked on a . U.S. proposal because it would have included legal immunity for American troops . who broke local laws. ISIS has seized American-made tanks and weapons along its push toward Baghdad -- materiel transferred to the Iraqi army before Obama ordered a troop pullout in 2011 .

The group aims to institute an Islamic 'caliphate' \u2013 a nation that transcends the borders of existing countries \u2013 held together by strict Shariah law. The United States has sent warships and aircraft carriers into the Persian Gulf in the last week while Mr Obama decides whether to engage ISIS with airstrikes. The White House said Monday that Mr Obama had sent 275 troops into Baghdad to protect the evacuation of embassy personnel and assets while they are moved far away from the fighting. On Tuesday ISIS reached within 60 miles of Iraq's capital city.

The last thing Liverpool need when Luis Suarez goes is a repeat of Tottenham\u2019s post-Gareth Bale trauma. Spurs raked in a world-record \u00a386million for Bale a year ago and then wasted it on seven underwhelming signings, like \u00a325m flop Erik Lamela. To avoid the same pitfalls, Anfield boss Brendan Rodgers has already done his homework and made plans to rebuild a Liverpool team that can challenge in the Premier League and Champions League. VIDEO Scroll down for Liverpool target Lazar Markovic scoring sublime goal for Benfica . Poitning the way: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has already been very busy in the market this summer . Heading for the exit: Last season's star man Luis Suarez is set to join Barcelona . Southampton\u2019s England World Cup players Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert have already arrived. So has 20-year-old defensive midfield player Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen. Even bigger fish are set to follow. Benfica winger Lazar Markovic is due for a medical on Thursday before completing his \u00a320million move from Portugal. Belgium\u2019s World Cup striker Divock Origi is in advance talks. A left back, possibly Swansea City\u2019s Ben Davies, is needed. Dejan Lovren wants to join from Southampton. The average age of the new squad will be among the youngest in the Premier League which perfectly fits the profile demanded by owner John W Henry. There will be some familiar faces. Steven Gerrard will continue as captain albeit Rodgers will not play him every week so he lasts the season. Lucas, Martin Skrtel and Glen Johnson will have parts to play. But overall as the washing powder commercials go, this Liverpool will be new and improved \u2013 even without Barcelona-bound Suarez. At least that is what Rodgers is counting on. Lazar quest: Benfica forward Markovic is expected to join Liverpool in a \u00a320million deal . VIDEO Liverpool set to seal double signing . \u2018NEW AND IMPROVED\u2019... HOW LIVERPOOL COULD LINE UP 2014-15 . GOALKEEPER \u2013 SIMON MIGNOLET . Made an immediate impact at Anfield last season with a match-winning penalty save on his debut against Stoke City. Now 26, he should be coming into his prime as a goalkeeper. RIGHT BACK \u2013 JON FLANAGAN . Just 21, local boy Flanagan has filled in across the defence to help the team but this could be his breakthrough season in his favoured position with Glen Johnson showing the first signs of decline. CENTRE BACK \u2013 DEJAN LOVREN . The Croatian World Cup defender has made it no secret he\u2019d like to join the Rodgers revolution at Anfield from Southampton. But a fee still has to be agreed with the St Mary\u2019s club. Shoring up: Southampton's Dejan Lovren was one of the outstanding defenders in the top flight last season . CENTRE BACK \u2013 MAMADOU SAKHO . Uncomfortable first season but excelled in the World Cup for France \u2013 where he was picked ahead of Arsenal\u2019s Laurent Koscielny \u2013 and now ready to show The Kop what \u00a317m was spent on. LEFT BACK \u2013 BEN DAVIES . Rodgers has been searching for a left back ever since he arrived at the club. Liverpool have been linked with plenty but \u00a36m Davies would be right up their street if Swansea sell. CENTRAL MIDFIELD \u2013 EMRE CAN . The German has just signed in a \u00a310m deal from Bayer Levekusen and doesn\u2019t lack confidence \u2013 agreeing to wear the No 23 shirt made famous by Jamie Carragher. Just 20, he is improving each year. Yes we Can: Liverpool have already signed Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen for \u00a310m this summer . CENTRAL MIDFIELD \u2013 STEVE GERRARD/PHILIPPE COUTINHO . Rodgers knows Gerrard can\u2019t play every week as he did last season, particularly with the club also back in Europe. When he wants to go for it, the excellent Coutinho can provide genuine trickery, with Can dropping back in to Gerrard's deeper role. CENTRAL MIDFIELD \u2013 ADAM LALLANA . Liverpool\u2019s most expensive signing of the summer so far at around \u00a325m, Lallana\u2019s ability to keep the ball moving and pick a pass means he will be essential to Rodgers\u2019 plans. RIGHT WING \u2013 RAHEEM STERLING . One of the few England players to return from the World Cup in credit. Hard to believe he\u2019s still only 19, the ultimate modern forward with pace, technique and courage on and off the ball. Sterling work: The England winger was a standout performer for the Reds last season . CENTRE FORWARD \u2013 DANIEL STURRIDGE . 35 goals in 49 games for Liverpool is an astonishing return for a player who didn\u2019t make it at Manchester City or Chelsea. Sturridge will be desperate to show he can score goals without Suarez. LEFT WING - LAZAR MARKOVIC . The 20-year-old Serbian is rated one of the best young talents in Europe and Rodgers hopes his signing from Benfica will give Liverpool a genuine threat down both flanks. Striking it rich: Sturridge (left) finished as the top flight's second highest goal scorer behind Suarez last season . SUBSTITUTES . MICHEL VORM \u2013 Rodgers wants cover for Mignolet in goal and Swansea\u2019s Dutchman Vorm is his No 1 target. GLEN JOHNSON \u2013 Not the force he once was but in a youthful squad, Johnson\u2019s experience will be vital in Europe. MARTN SKRTEL - Found it hard to adapt to the passing style being imposed by Rodgers, but he decided to stay at Anfield and was one of their most consistent performers last season. JOE ALLEN \u2013 Rodgers\u2019 first signing, for \u00a315m from Swansea, the Welshman is among the most accurate passers in the Premier League and a growing influence on the pitch. Case for the defence: Johnson (left) and Skrtel (right) will still have a role to play next season . JORDAN HENDERSON \u2013 One of few Kenny Dalglish signings to survive and thrive under Rodgers. Possesses a fantastic midfield engine and is versatile. RICKIE LAMBERT \u2013 The Liverpudlian had a roundabout route to Anfield via Rochdale, Bristol Rovers and Southampton but he\u2019s happy to be back \u2018home\u2019 after a \u00a34m summer move from Southampton. DIVOCK ORIGI \u2013 One of the new stars to emerge from the World Cup, Origi\u2019s pace and trickery make him a natural replacement for Sturridge if the England man ever needs a rest.

The Prime Minister is warned his early enthusiasm for involving voluntary groups in running Britain is \u2018going nowhere\u2019. The Big Society concept was widely ridiculed when floated by Mr Cameron before the 2010 general election, with even supporters of the idea complaining that the PM had failed to explain what it actually meant.

Councils which provide huge levels of income for charities have seen funding from Westminster slashed. Charities also warn that people who rely on state are seeing support eroded.

While the threat of Ebola is very real in Africa, the paranoia it's generated in the United States is unreal. You can count the number of documented cases in America on two hands -- and still have fingers to spare. There are eight confirmed cases. And in each one, the patient was either infected in Liberia or Sierra Leone, or had contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian returnee who's the sole fatality of the disease in the U.S. Health care professionals, both within the government and those with little reason to parrot a party line, insist that the chances of any of us catching the virus are minuscule. If we really need something to worry about, they say, worry about getting your flu shots. From 1976 through 2007, flu-related causes killed between 3,000 and 49,000 people in the U.S. And yet, the disproportionate hysteria over Ebola multiplies contagiously. Mel Robbins, a CNN commentator and legal analyst, has given it a name: Fear-bola. \"Fear-bola attacks the part of the brain responsible for rational thinking,\" she says. \"It starts with a low-grade concern about the two health care workers diagnosed with Ebola in Dallas and slowly builds into fear of a widespread epidemic in the United States.\" Complete coverage of the Ebola outbreak . How bad is it? So bad that nearly two thirds of those queried in a Washington Post/ABC News poll said they're concerned about an epidemic in the U.S. So bad that the Centers for Disease Control, in the first week of October, fielded 800 calls from concerned Americans. So bad that even after a Dallas lab worker -- who isolated herself in her cabin during a Carnival Cruise because she may have possibly handled Duncan's clinical specimen -- was cleared, the Moore, Oklahoma, Public Schools asked students and faculty who were on the same cruise not to come to school. Here are some more examples of our overreaction: . From Nigeria? Not this year . Navarro College, a two-year college about 60 miles from Dallas, sent out rejection letters to some applicants from Nigeria because the country had a few Ebola cases. \"With sincere regret, I must report that Navarro College is not able to offer you acceptance for the Spring 2015 term,\" the letter read. \"Unfortunately, Navarro College is not accepting international students from countries with confirmed Ebola cases.\" The college called it \"the responsible thing to do.\" \"At this time, we believe it is the responsible thing to do to postpone our recruitment in those nations that the Center for Disease Control and the U.S. State Department have identified as at risk.\" Incidentally, Nigeria had 19 cases, but none in the last 43 days. In fact, the World Health Organization declared it Ebola-free on Monday. Who shouts 'Ebola' on a plane? Get sick in a parking lot, force a shutdown . A woman boarded a shuttle bus in a Pentagon parking lot Thursday, got off and vomited. A hazmat team responded, the area was cordoned off, military officials going to a Marine Corps ceremony were temporarily quarantined, the woman was put into isolation. A Pentagon spokesman said it was \"out of an abundance of caution.\" The woman didn't have Ebola. Get sick on a plane, stay in the bathroom . A passenger who vomited in the aisle of an American Airlines plane from Dallas to Chicago was allegedly told to stay in the lavatory for the rest of the flight. \"They told her to stay in the bathroom, and she stayed in the bathroom,\" Martha Selby, a University of Texas professor who was on the flight, told the Houston Chronicle. \"They said, 'We can't let you out.'\" The airlines told the paper that the woman wanted to stay in the bathroom, and that \"there were no concerns related to Ebola.\" The woman didn't have Ebola. Go to a conference, go on leave . An elementary school teacher in Maine was put on 21 days' leave - the incubation period for Ebola -- because she went to Dallas for an education conference. While there, she stayed at a hotel about 10 miles from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where a patient died of the disease. Still, parents were concerned, and the school district said it obliged. Here's how the Portland Press Herald put it into perspective: About 5 million Americans passed through Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in August, the latest month for which statistics are available. The woman, of course, didn't have Ebola. What's more contagious than Ebola? Concern about its spread . Go to a funeral, go on vacation . A middle school principal in Hazelhurst, Mississippi, who went to his brother's funeral in Africa is now on a weeklong paid vacation. Why? Because parents pulled their kids out of school Friday once they learned of the trip. And where in Africa did the principal go? Zambia, which has reported a total of zero Ebola cases. The principal didn't have ... you know the rest. Don't like the team, taunt the player . A West African high school soccer player in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, was taunted with chants of \"Ebola\" by players of the opposing team during a game earlier this month. The opposing team's head coach and assistant coach resigned the next day. The player ... so on and so forth. What's more disturbing than Ebola? The outrageous commentary . Yell 'Ebola,' trigger panic . Last week, a masked man in a Los Angeles public bus yelled, \"Don't mess with me, I have Ebola!\" The bus driver was quarantined and the bus taken out of service. The man disappeared. But officials doubt he has Ebola. Pat down = paid leave . A TSA agent at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport is now on paid administrative leave because he/she pat down Amber Vinson. She's one of the nurses who contracted Ebola after treating Duncan. And before her illness was apparent, she took a Frontier Airlines flight to Cleveland, then a flight back to Dallas. The agent wore gloves during the pat down, the TSA told Newsnet5 in Cleveland. And yet, the leave was \"out of an abundance of caution.\" Never mind that Ebola is only spread through direct contact with blood, sweat, feces, vomit, semen and saliva.

A council boss who earned more than the Prime Minister has left her job with a \u00a3219,000 pay-off after being accused of bullying and claiming excessive expenses. Andrea Hill, chief executive of Suffolk County Council, has quit the local authority after three years of controversy. She repeatedly defied calls from the Government to take a 10 per cent pay cut \u2013 even though she earned around \u00a375,000 more than David Cameron\u2019s salary of \u00a3142,500. Suffolk County Council chief executive Andrea Hill had been on paid leave since Easter but has stepped down . The 47-year-old also faced criticism over her \u2018domineering management style\u2019. A spokesman for Suffolk County Council said Mrs Hill had left the council following \u2018lengthy\u2019 talks. The news was immediately welcomed by one of her leading council critics, Kathy Pollard, who said: \u2018There will be a feeling of immense relief across the county. \u2018It has been a very unhappy chapter in Suffolk\u2019s history especially for those of us who voted against her appointment in the first place. \u2018She introduced cuts but her position became more and more tenuous as she refused to take a pay cut herself - she was obviously not willing to share the pain with the rest of us.\u2019 \u2018It is no secret that the public were very angry about her salary and hopefully there will be full transparency when her successor is appointed with clear salary guidelines - which was not the case with Mrs Hill.\u2019 Today\u2019s announcement, which came after a 90-minute meeting of the council\u2019s dismissals appeals committee, follows increasing pressure on Mrs Hill to quit. In a statement today, a spokesman for Suffolk County Council said: 'Following a lengthy discussion last Friday, and negotiations between representatives of both parties over the weekend, the county council can now confirm that Mrs Hill will be leaving her post with immediate effect.' Today's announcement, which came after a 90-minute meeting of Suffolk County Council's dismissals appeals committee, follows increasing pressure on Mrs Hill to quit . An independent inquiry was launched into both the accusations of bullying and excessive expenses claims. The council\u2019s dismissal and appeals committee met to discuss its conclusions. The spokesman added: \u2018Bullying and . harassment allegations were robustly investigated. Although it remains a . concern that such a perception existed, the committee is satisfied that . there was no evidence to support those claims.\u2019 March 31: Suffolk .

July 4: Suffolk County Council confirms Mrs Hill will be leaving her post with immediate effect. Regarding her expenses claims, the . committee admitted \u2018there were undoubtedly claims which, in the current . climate, might not represent best use of public money\u2019. But it \u2018accepted that there was no dishonesty\u2019. Two senior long-serving council officers resigned suddenly earlier this year, which was followed by the apparent suicide of the head of legal services, David White, who had worked for the council for more than 20 years. An anonymous whistle-blower complained to councillors about Mrs Hill\u2019s management style which led to a detailed investigation by a leading London law firm whose report was considered before today\u2019s crunch meeting. Mrs Hill had come to Suffolk from a similar job as head of Bedford county council. But a little over three years later, under intense fire for her official life style - thousands of pounds of ratepayers\u2019 money spent on \u2018vanity\u2019 portrait photographs, nights in luxury hotels and expensive \u2018team building\u2019 lessons - her reign is over. A legal inquiry into claims by a whistleblower about Mrs Hill - which has cost thousands of pounds - formally ended last Friday when the council\u2019s dismissals appeals committee met for five hours to consider its conclusions. After weeks of negotiating between lawyers behind closed doors, the authority has agreed that Mrs Hill will leave - in her handbag a settlement agreement totalling \u00a3218,592. She has been on extended leave since Easter at the Cambridgeshire home she shares with her husband Philip and their three children and will now be able to spend more time with her family. Before she went on leave Mrs Hill circulated an extraordinary 1,800-word defence to council employees claiming her critics were motivated by envy and that she should be seen as a \u2018role model\u2019. Instead, she said, she had been attacked by the media and political opponents, her children had been bullied, her friends pestered and her staff abused. She also alleged that some websites called for people to carry out \u2018extreme acts of violence\u2019 against her. But there\u2019s no triumphant legacy for Mrs Hill either - her controversial \u2018New Strategic Direction\u2019 policy lies in tatters. The new council chairman, Mark Bee, moved swiftly last month with a promise to scrap large parts of its plan to hive-off services such as libraries, recycling and school crossing patrols. But it was Mrs Hill\u2019s six-figure salary which placed her among the highest-rewarded council chiefs in the country that angered many ratepayers. Not only because it was awarded without the proper procedure, according to critics, but because it was topped up a payment of some \u00a350,000 a year \u2018deferred pay\u2019 put into Mrs Hill\u2019s pension pot. By contrast the man she took over from, Mike More, had earlier announced he was giving up a \u00a336,000 performance-related bonus, seemingly happy with his \u00a3200,000 a year as chief executive of Westminster City Council. Mrs Hill stridently pointed out that she had turned down pay increases totalling \u00a3210 a week but would not consider any reduction in her current salary. In an interview with the local paper\u2019s local government reporter - who was blacklisted for exposing some of Mrs Hill\u2019s spending follies - she insisted: \u2018I do understand it is a big salary but I got the job in open competition. \u2018Anybody in the country could have applied for it - in fact many people did and they were chief executives on similar salaries to mine.\u2019 And while it didn\u2019t impress librarians or lollipop ladies who were facing the sack at the time, Mrs Hill seemed proud that she had set a good example. She said: \u2018Actually I have taken a lead on pay restraint because I decided, quite by myself, to give up a pay increase of \u00a35,000 and I gave up another increase in 2009 of over \u00a36,000 so that\u2019s \u00a311,000 I have forgone. \u2018I have considered that I have already given up two pay increases and I think that was the thing to do at the time and I won\u2019t be taking another pay cut.\u2019 What won the imperious Mrs Hill few friends was her adamant assertion that she was worth her huge salary because she was in 'a high-risk job.' It prompted one angry ratepayer to write pointing out some might consider a young Suffolk soldier in the Royal Anglian Regiment fighting in Iraq on a tenth of her salary was the one in a real high-risk occupation.

The Office of Inspector General confirms to CNN that it has staff investigators on the ground in San Antonio looking into the allegations. The allegations surrounding this Texas VA hospital comes as the federal department fends off claims of potentially deadly delays at other facilities, including claims of a secret wait list in Phoenix that was first reported by CNN. Phoenix VA officials deny secret wait list; doctors say they're lying . The VA's official policy is that all patients should be able to see a doctor, dentist or some other medical professional within 14 days of their requested/preferred date. Any wait longer than two weeks is supposed to documented. Yet Brian Turner, a Veterans Affairs scheduling clerk based in San Antonio, said Thursday that some who called to make appointments at his facility did end up waiting longer, yet such delays were never reported. For example, he said, they might be told the next available appointment wasn't for several months. It would be scheduled for then, but marked in official files as if the patient had put off their appointment until then by choice. \"What we've been instructed was that -- they are not saying fudged, there is no secret wait list -- but what they've done is come out and just say 'zero out that date,' \" Turner said. The \"zero,\" in this case, suggests the patient didn't have to wait at all. \"It could be three months and look like no days (wait),\" he added. \"It looked like they had scheduled the appointment and got exactly what they wanted.\" The Veterans Affairs public affairs office said that Turner's allegation has been looked into, without any finding of wrongdoing. \"Based on our internal fact-finding conducted April 25-28, we found the claims by this employee were not substantiated,\" the VA statement said. However, the Office of Inspector General says it is conducting its own investigation. Turner tells CNN he has already been interviewed by OIG staff. The claim comes amid strong public pressure on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and its leader, Eric Shinseki, after CNN reporting unveiled e-mails that allegedly discussed the destruction of a secret list of veterans waiting for care at a Phoenix VA hospital. Shinseki has ordered a \"face-to-face audit\" at VA clinics, a department spokesman said on Thursday. Earlier the same day, a House committee voted to subpoena Shinseki in the wake of such accusations that his department is responsible for deadly delays in health care. Shinseki orders 'face-to-face audit' at clinics . Turner told CNN that he's become a witness in an investigation by the VA inspector general's office focusing on delayed care, alleged falsification of records and possible medical harm to veterans at the San Antonio facility. Turner, a former Army soldier himself who still works at the VA, said he has asked to be protected under federal whistle-blower laws. As to the VA's earlier fact-finding efforts, Turner said that no one asked him about his allegations. In fact, he said, when he began expressing his concerns to other staff members, he was called in and told not to e-mail another person. \"They shut me up the very next day,\" Turner said.

Three children of murderer Melanie Smith have revealed the torture they suffered at their mother's hands growing up. Lisa, Charlotte and Jonathon have spoken for the first time about their mother who they describe as the most evil woman in Britain after she was convicted last week of burning five people to death. They revealed how Smith burned them with cigarettes, poured boiling water over them and locked them in a tiny cupboard if they cried. She also chopped off their hair if they made 'too much noise'. Their father Paul, now 51, fought Smith for custody of the children but lost. It was only when she abandoned them in voluntary foster care that he won them back and their ordeal ended. Devastated: Lisa and Charlotte, pictured with their father Paul, have spoken for the first about the abuse they suffered at the hands of their mother Melanie Smith . Jobless Smith was yesterday convicted by a 10-2 majority of five counts of murder, making her one of the most prolific murderesses in modern British history. Smith set fire to a baby's pushchair because she was fed up with it being outside her front door. But the blaze spread into a devastating . inferno which ripped through the first-floor flat in Prestatyn, North . Wales, last October. Guilty: Melanie Smith has been convicted of killing her neighbours by setting fire to their home . It trapped and killed Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her partner Liam Timbrell, 23, their baby son Charlie, 15 months, Miss Shiers\u2019s nephew Bailey, four, and niece Skye, two. Smith will be sentenced next month. Her daughter Charlotte, now 23, told the Sunday Mirror: 'We all wish she was dead. Knowing that the evil woman who killed that poor family is our mother is almost impossible to bear. Dad rescued us from hell. He\u2019s brought us all up without her but now she\u2019s back in our lives in the most horrific way imaginable. She\u2019s been dead to us since we were tiny. Now I just want her to rot in hell.' Paul married Melanie in August 1987, two years after they met at Pontins near Prestatyn where she worked as a chamber maid. She gave birth to their three children - Lisa, now 24, Charlotte, 23, and Jonathon, now 22, within the next four years but Paul said he immediately noticed she lacked any maternal instinct. As she began to drink more and more, Paul began to notice marks on the children but Melanie always had an excuse. The final straw came when he discovered her in bed with another man while their three children were locked in another room. Blaze victims: Liam Timbrell, right, with Lee-Anna Shiers and their baby Charlie shortly after his birth . Tragic: Skye Allen, two, and her brother Bailey , four, who were killed in the fire in the first-floor flat in Prestatyn . Deaths: Ms Shiers, left, and her 15-month-old son Charlie were both killed following the blaze set by Smith . The couple divorced and Melanie won custody of the children but put them in care a day later because she couldn't cope. Paul told the newspaper: 'When I picked the kids up from the foster home that day, I vowed that Melanie would never hurt them again. None of us ever saw or spoke to her again. She\u2019s never sent one birthday or Christmas card and there\u2019s never been a single letter.' The next time Paul and his children saw Melanie was when her photo appeared on TV following her arrest over the blaze. Paul added: 'Her cruelty has finally got her what she deserves. We just feel so sad for the victims and their families.' Fire: The smoke-damaged property in Prestatyn after the blaze which killed five people last year .

Mark Spencer, Conservative MP for . Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, said the figures were evidence that a 'compensation . culture' has spread to the force. He said: 'We have lost the plot in terms of what we think it is acceptable to claim for. 'We are inundated with ambulance-chasing adverts on TV for no-win no-fee services. 'If you slip on ice while you are at home you are a dozy twit - if you do it at work all of a sudden it's someone else's fault.' Retired policeman Ray Egan, 75, . yesterday criticised the payouts and said he was 'surprised' officers . had become part of a compensation culture 'sweeping the nation'. Mr Egan, who served with West . Midlands Police from 1967 to 1993, said: 'It's all to do with this claim . culture, it's like a disease and people are jumping on the bandwagon. I don't know where it is going end. 'I'm surprised the blame culture has . spread to the police force. But everybody else is jumping on board, so . it's just human nature. 'It's costing the country a lot of money, it could be spent on policing and put to much better use. 'It's crazy really. What we need back is the man on the beat, it's become an endangered species. 'They can't stop people claiming, it's just going to go on and on. I'm just glad I'm retired and out of it.' In total \u00a3446,999 has been paid out by the Nottinghamshire Police to injured officers and civilian staff. Paddy Tipping, Police and Crime Commissioner for Nottinghamshire, added: 'The force need to take a firm but fair line on this. 'Police officers when they join know . they are taking on a demanding and dangerous role and know getting . injured is a real possibility. 'But at the same time if the force has been negligent we need to satisfy that and pay a fair degree of compensation.' But Phil Matthews, chairman of . the Nottinghamshire branch of the Police Federation, defended the right . of officers to make claims. He said: 'You do not get thousands of . pounds because you have tripped over something - you get it because you . have suffered a serious injury. 'If you went to any other organisation . that employed about 4,000 people over a number of sites and asked them . how many claims had they had, I think we could fair quite well.

Dangerous job: Nottinghamshire Police has also made six payouts - including one \u00a317,826 settlement - to officers who have been bitten by the force's own dogs (stock image) John Blanchard, chair of the Humberside . Police Federation, added most officers are reasonable and will not claim . for compensation unless it is necessary. He said: 'Officers are entitled to the same protection as any other member of the public when it comes to injury. 'If compensation is due, compensation is due. By the same token, I expect a level of common sense and reason. 'There is absolutely an element of risk . in policing. The vast majority of officers will have had bumps, knocks, . scrapes and all kinds of injuries and it won't have crossed their minds . to claim. 'It is part of the rough and tumble of the job.' Most officers will seek advice from the Police Federation, which runs its own claim line for officers. Mr Blanchard said all cases are reviewed and evaluated by an independent solicitor to assess whether they will be successful. He said: 'The force's insurers are very thorough and don't pay out unless there is some fault there. 'We will have people come to us and, if we don't think they will be successful, we will give them a reality check. 'At the end of the day, it is our members' money and taxpayers' money that will be paid out.' Statistics: Humberside Police has received 44 compensation claims from staff between January 2010 and March this year - with 16 claims successful, 10 rejected and the rest ongoing . However, Mr Blanchard said such claims can improve safety for other officers. He continued: 'If officers have been injured, money doesn't make it all better. It is about providing some comfort, or . medical appliances that are needed, and it is also about demonstrating . to the force that the right health and safety measures were not in place . and they can correct them.' Malcolm Turner, deputy head of Nottinghamshire Police . legal services, said the force reviewed outstanding claims every month - . with checks made by the Deputy Chief Constable. He said: 'While some incidents may . apparently seem to be trivial, the consequences which might flow from . them can, on occasion, be very significant. 'Claims are handled in-house and all are . carefully scrutinised to ensure compensation is only paid in cases . where that is appropriate and the amounts paid are in line with the . guidance issued by the Judicial College.' The figures have been criticised by the Taxpayers' Alliance, which argued it included 'trivial claims', such as an officer receiving \u00a31,200 for sprains after a strap broke on some portable equipment. Andrew Allison, spokesman for the Taxpayers' Alliance in East Yorkshire, said: 'There appears to be no doubt that the compensation culture in Britain is out of hand. 'Police officers should not be pursuing trivial claims such as when a strap breaks on equipment. 'Accidents like these happen every day. They should be leading by example and remember that taxpayers are picking up the bill.'

NASA\u2019s Kepler space telescope has discovered 11 new planetary systems hosting 26 confirmed planets. It's the latest find from a two-year space scan, and brings the total to 60 confirmed planets. The new haul triples the number of multi-planet solar systems found by Kepler. Doug Hudgins, a Kepler scientist at Nasa says, 'In just two years staring at a patch of sky not much bigger than your fist, Kepler has discovered more than 60 planets. Our galaxy is positively loaded with . planets of all sizes and orbits.' Diagrams of the multi-planet systems detected by the Kepler space telescope: The planets range in size from 1.5 times the size of Earth to ones bigger than the gas giant Jupiter . The planets orbit close to their host stars and range in size from 1.5 times the radius of Earth to larger than Jupiter. Fifteen are between Earth and Neptune in size. Further observations will be required to determine which are rocky like Earth and which have thick gaseous atmospheres like Neptune. All the new planets are closer to their host star than Venus is to our Sun. Kepler-33, a star that is older and more . massive than our Sun, had the most planets. The system hosts five . planets, ranging in size from 1.5 to 5 times that of Earth. 'Prior to the Kepler mission, we knew of perhaps 500 exoplanets across the whole sky,' said Doug Hudgins, Kepler program scientist at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Kepler identifies planet candidates by repeatedly measuring the change in brightness of stars to detect when a planet passes in front of the star. That passage casts a small shadow toward Earth and the Kepler spacecraft. The planets were detected by monitoring changes in brightness as they orbit in front of their stars. Scientists will now try to establish whether they are rocky, like earth, or gaseous, like Neptune . Each of the new confirmed planetary systems contains two to five closely spaced transiting planets. In tightly packed planetary systems, the gravitational pull of the planets on each other causes some planets to accelerate and some to decelerate along their orbits. Kepler detects this effect by measuring the changes, or so-called Transit Timing Variations (TTVs).Planetary systems with TTVs can be verified without requiring extensive ground-based observations, accelerating confirmation of planet candidates. The TTV detection technique also increases Kepler\u2019s ability to confirm planetary systems around fainter and more distant stars.Five of the systems (Kepler-25, Kepler-27, Kepler-30, Kepler-31 and Kepler-33) contain a pair of planets where the inner planet orbits the star twice during each orbit of the outer planet. Four of the systems (Kepler-23, Kepler-24, Kepler-28 and Kepler-32) contain a pairing where the outer planet circles the star twice for every three times the inner planet orbits its star. The properties of a star provide clues for planet detection. The decrease in the star\u2019s brightness and duration of a planet transit, combined with the properties of its host star, present a recognizable signature. When astronomers detect planet candidates that exhibit similar signatures around the same star, the likelihood of any of these planet candidates being a false positive is very low.'The approach used to verify the Kepler-33 planets shows the overall reliability is quite high,' said Jack Lissauer, planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., and lead author of the paper on Kepler-33. These discoveries are published in four different papers in the Astrophysical Journal and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Doug Hudgins announced that NASA's Kepler telescope has discovered 11 new planetary systems with 26 planets, confirmed by Transit Timing Variations (TTVs).

The skater-turned-Olympic commentator met men on Grindr, a gay social network that shows men if they are near other members, and sent them full-front naked selfies, according to Radar. The images and messages are just the latest revelations in a messy divorce case between 29-year-old Weir and his husband of two years, lawyer Victor Voronov. In messages reportedly obtained by Radar, a man who identified himself as Weir asked another Grindr member if he lives nearby, although the location is not known. Scroll down for video . Bitter battle: Johny Weir, right, and his husband of two years, Victor Voronov, left, are divorcing - and amid the split it has been claimed that Weir messaged other men through gay social network, Grindr . Weir allegedly told him: 'I'm a figure skater. We have a show here\u2026 What are you looking for here.' The man, who has not been identified, responded: 'Cool. You must have strong legs.' Weir also reportedly sent an image showing his reflection in a mirror. Voronov has also claimed he has an image showing his ex's penis, Radar reported - but Weir has previously said he is not worried about such images surfacing. 'The worst that he could do is post naked photos that we have between each other and I look flawless,' he told Access Hollywood last month. Weir filed for divorce from Voronov, whom he married at the end of 2011 after just months of dating, in February while working as a commentator for NBC at the Sochi Olympics. Nasty divorce: Weir, pictured naked on his show Be Good Johnny Weir, was accused by Vornonov of sending  nude photos and steamy messages to men online, and his husband also has nude images of him . Nasty divorce: Weir said he was not concerned about his ex sharing naked images of him following the split. He claimed Voronov physically and emotionally abused him . The split has sparked a series of bitter digs - from Weir claiming Voronov destroyed his beloved Birkin bags, and Voronov claiming his ex sent text messages to gay porn star Michael Lucas and engaged in threesomes. Most recently, Voronov accused his estranged husband of sending a 'hateful' and 'disgusting' email and filed court papers saying Weir had violated a temporary restraining order by sending the email. 'Johnny sent Victor a disgusting, hateful email which violated the no contact order as part of the temporary restraining order he got last week,' a source told Radar. Voronov had the restraining order put in place after an incident on March 5 in which Weir allegedly hit him on the arm and threw a wooden Russian doll at him. 'So on Monday, Victor filed a police . report with cops in Rutherford, New Jersey,' the source added. 'Johnny could be in very serious legal trouble if the judge finds . him in contempt for violating terms of the temporary restraining order.' Exes: Voronov has claimed that Weir cheated on him throughout the relationship and said Weir recently sent him a 'hateful' email that violated a temporary restraining order he had out against his ex . Pettiness aside: The couple's bickering revolved around ownership of designer bags and other valuables including a Faberge egg. Voronov at one point claimed his figure skater husband held their dog Tema hostage . Voronov, 29, claims Weir committed multiple acts of adultery - . including an affair with an unidentified Chicago club owner. He also says Weir is holding their dog Tema . hostage. In legal . documents obtained by TMZ, Voronov alleges Weir forced him out . of the closet and that he married him because . his life with a Georgetown-educated lawyer would make compelling . reality TV. In addition to the allegations of adultery and cruelty, Voronov is also requesting a judge to force Weir to return property the lawyer claims the Olympian took from him. These include 20 furs - including a $125,000 coat made from sable - a crocodile Celine bag, 40 Balenciaga bags, one green and one orange Hermes Birkin and 12 Chanel bags. He is also claiming temporary support and legal fees. Olympic favorite: Weir was a hit as he commentated on the Sochi Olympics with Tara Lipinski earlier this year - but he has said that behind the scenes he was struggling with his demanding and emotionally abusive husband . A source close to Weir told TMZ that the property Voronov is requesting was the Winter Olympic commentators before their marriage. The source also added that Weir 'categorically denies' the adultery allegations. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Weir made his own swipes at his ex, claiming his non-practicing attorney husband was often abusive towards him and relied on his money. He claimed he was struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner. 'Sochi was one of the hardest times in my life,' he said. 'When I was on the broadcasting, I escaped my own personal hell that I was living in. 'My husband was behaving very erratically. The majority of the time off camera I was in tears. I was on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a good place.' Happier times: Voronov and Weir on their wedding day in 2011 and (right) out and about in Manhattan . He added that their fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of control, including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the police. A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm. Despite the fall out, however, the couple appeared together in a New Jersey court last month and a judge agreed to dismiss the case. Weir announced their divorce on Twitter two weeks ago, writing: 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts and I wish him well.' Despite the rocky relationship, Voronov said on his Twitter shortly afterwards that he had not been aware that Weir had filed for divorce until the announcement. 'Shocked by the abrupt ending of my marriage and am dealing with the trauma including multiple things I am just now becoming aware of...' he wrote. Champion on ice: Weir competed in the 2010 . Vancouver Winter Olympics, finishing sixth place in the men's single . competition, and was a hit in his first commentary stint at Sochi . He added: 'Yes. I'd like to confirm, It's true: I am only now finding out that my husband @johnnygweir filed for divorce from me months ago.' Voronov's spokesperson, Wendy Feldman, added: 'It is our extreme hope and desire that this divorce could have been handled amicably. Not only is Victor heartbroken but he is now humiliated.' Weir officially came out as gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality. On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov. But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery. 'A marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's constant fireworks.

UPDATED: . 09:54 EST, 11 September 2013 . Nigel Evans today delivered an extraordinary Commons speech protesting his innocence after being charged with a series of sex offences against seven men. Quitting as Deputy Speaker, he addressed hundreds of MPs including the Prime Minister about his desire to \u2018robustly defend my innocence and seek acquittal\u2019. Quoting Churchill, he referred to the death of his mother and the spiritual support of Parliament\u2019s chaplain before thanking fellow MPs for their \u2018hugs, prayers and good wishes\u2019. Scroll down for video . Speech: Nigel Evans addressed MPs in a personal statement after Prime Minister's Questions . Last night Evans was charged with the rape of a man between March 29 and April 1, 2013, five sexual assaults dating back to 2009 and two indecent assaults dating back to 2002. The Conservative says he will continue to represent his Ribble Valley constituency in Lancashire but as an independent MP. The decision to charge the openly-gay politician \u2013 a popular figure in Westminster \u2013 came after he was arrested for a third time yesterday morning. Speaking immediately after Prime Minster\u2019s Questions, he told a packed Commons chamber: \u2018I hope you will bear with me while I make this statement, it\u2019s been a few years since I made a speech in this chamber and I\u2019m sad to say this is the speech. \u2018As many of you will know following recent allegations, I was charged with alleged offences yesterday. I now have the opportunity to robustly defend my innocence and seek acquittal. \u2018I have therefore decided the best course of action is for me to return to the backbenches and this is a decision I have made myself after careful consideration.\u2019 When he left Preston police station last night, he gave\u00a0 a short statement before saying he \u2018will not be making any further comment until after the case concludes\u2019. But in the Commons he spoke at length about the impact of the case on his. Thanks: Evans listed the many people he says have shown him 'compassionate consideration' Evans said: \u2018It was one of the happiest days of my life when I was elected deputy speaker in 2010, it was an endorsement of my abilities to do the job by my colleagues and for that I am grateful. \u2018Since these allegations, I have not been able to fully fulfil my duties in the chair, which left me in a land of limbo. \u2018None of us were elected to the fine office of Member of Parliament to be put in that invidious position, unable to fully fulfil the reason why we were sent here.\u2019 He said he was \u2018grateful\u2019 for the \u2018unstinting support\u2019 he has revceived from Mr Bercow and the other two deputy speakers, Lindsay Hoyle and Dawn Primarolo. Evans went on: \u2018When I told Ms Primarolo on Saturday my decision, I even got a hug from her - thank you Dawn. \u2018I have had so many hugs, prayers and good wishes since May 4 and I would like to thank everyone who has shown me such compassionate consideration, my family particularly, my association, who have been marvellous, and even seasoned, crusty journalists have displayed a heart I have never before witnessed. \u2018I was told I would soon see who my real friends are and that has been true. But the truth is there have been so many of them - so thank you to my dearest loyal friends, including loyal members of my staff at Westminster and the Ribble Valley. Grateful: Speaker John Bercow paid tribute to Mr Evans twice in the Commons . \u2018And to you, my colleagues, on all sides of the House who have spoken with me, looked after me and just shown loving attention. Party divisions disappear in times like this and they have, thank you. \u2018Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the Speaker\u2019s chaplain, and Andrew Tremlett, the canon of Westminster Abbey, have given me superb spiritual guidance which has given me the one thing everyone in this world needs, alongside air, water and food: that is hope. \u2018Hope is that essential key to giving us a fulfilled life and they have ensured I have retained that hope.\u2019 Evans said: \u2018This is clearly the most painful thing I have endured in my life alongside the loss of my mother in 2009 and the loss of my brother earlier this year. \u2018Winston Churchill said when you are going through hell, keep going. Sage advice. And so I will see this through to the end with the support of the people that mean so much to me.\u2019 The Ribble Valley MP added: \u2018Returning to the backbenches gives me the opportunity to speak out on issues such as the over-building of new homes in the Ribble Valley, threats to the Slaidburn doctors\u2019 surgery and cuts to rural bus services. \u2018It\u2019s the bread and butter of politics, giving support to the people who put me in the mother of parliaments, my home for the past 21 years and a place that has meant so much to me. \u2018I am proud to serve the people of the Ribble Valley and the best tribute I can give them now is to get on with the job that they sent me here to do.\u2019 Tory MP Nadine Dorries placed a hand on Evans\u2019s shoulder as he sat down after his statement. Earlier, at the start of Commons session, Mr Bercow said: \u2018I have received his resignation with sadness. I wish to thank Nigel for his three years of service to the House as deputy speaker, in which he has proved to be highly competent, fair and good-humoured. \u2018He has been a loyal and valued member of the team of deputy speakers who assist me in chairing our proceedings. I am warmly grateful to him.\u2019 Evans will appear before magistrates in Preston on September 18. The indecent assaults are alleged to have been committed between January 1, 2002 and January 1, 2004; the sexual assaults between January 1, 2009 and April 1 this year; and the rape between March 29 and April 1 this year. Evans's initial arrest in early May related to offences alleged to have been committed in Pendleton, Lancashire . Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer said: \u2018Following an investigation by Lancashire police, the Crown Prosecution Service has received a file of evidence in the case of Mr Nigel Evans MP which concerns allegations of a sexual nature. \u2018After careful consideration, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and that it is in the public interest to prosecute Evans. \u2018Lancashire Constabulary has therefore been authorised to charge two counts of indecent assault, five counts of sexual assault and one count of rape relating to a total of seven alleged victims. \u2018The decision in this case was taken by Joanne Cunliffe, an experienced specialist rape prosecutor, in consultation with John Dilworth, head of the CPS North West Complex Casework Unit and in consultation with an external and highly experienced criminal QC. \u2018I have also been consulted on this case. The decision has been taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and the CPS legal guidance on rape and sexual offences.\u2019 Evans, from Pendleton, Lancashire, stepped aside from his deputy speaker duties after his arrest but had continued to work as an MP. He was one of three deputy speakers elected in a secret ballot of MPs in 2010. Later that year he came out as gay, saying he was \u2018\u2019tired of living a lie\u2019\u2019. He was a vice chairman of the Conservative Party from 1999 to 2001. When Iain Duncan Smith became party leader in 2001, he was promoted to the shadow cabinet as shadow Welsh secretary - a post he held for two years.

Sacked: Paul Kellerman lost his job as a delivery driver after being wrongly recorded doing 103 mph when he was only driving at 34 mph . A delivery driver who was wrongly recorded speeding at 103 mph has been sacked despite the police apologising for the blunder and his van being unable to go above 70 mph. Paul Kellerman, 43, was dismissed after his firm received a prosecution notice stating he was caught speeding in a 40 mph zone, when he had actually been travelling at just 34 mph . The manager of the police force's speed camera unit later admitted the error, but the company would not relent and Mr Kellerman is still looking for another job. He was on his way to deliver electrical goods to Stevenage, Hertfordshire, when he noticed a speed camera flash as he drove along the Hatfield Road in St Albans. Paul, of Cudworth in Barnsley, South Yorkshire, said: 'I saw the signs and knew it was a 40 mph zone but I knew I wasn't doing much more than 30 mph. 'I was gutted but I knew I was well under the limit. It's a high street, you can't do 103 mph and I wouldn't do that anyway.' His van even had a speed limiter on it, meaning it cannot go above 70 mph. Mr Kellerman contacted the police to complain and officers admitted their mistake. A letter from the speed unit manager said: 'On further investigation it is apparent that you were travelling within the speed limit at 34 mph in a 40 mph zone and the ticket was issued as a result of operator error.' The unit manager even telephone Mr Kellerman's boss but his job had already been filled. The speed camera had wrongly recorded the speed of Mr Kellerman's vehicle and the operator failed to check the speed before issuing the notice. Mr Kellerman, who worked up to 80 hours a week for \u00a3320, also called the speed unit and said they could not apologise enough. He said: 'I was told it was an error on their part. They kept saying they were sorry and I wasn't the first person but I have still lost my job.' Mr Kellerman has lost a stone and a half in weight since being sacked. He has also signed up for housing benefits and has had to ask for help in paying his rent. Error: Mr Kellerman was travelling at just 34 mph when he was flashed by the speed camera (library image) He said: 'I tried to explain to my boss that I would never drive so fast but was replaced straight away because of the constant flow of work.

Douglas Prade walked out of the Madison Correctional Institution around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, CNN affiliate WOIO reported, a few hours after Summit County Common Pleas Judge Judy Hunter ruled he was innocent of the crime and ordered him released. County officials said they will appeal the decision. Margo Prade, a popular doctor, was found dead of multiple gunshot wounds in her vehicle in her office's parking lot in November 1997. Douglas Prade was indicted for aggravated murder the next February and convicted in September of that year. He was sentenced to life in prison. The case dominated local headlines for months and was the subject of crime shows on national TV. Although DNA tests conducted at the time were inconclusive, the main evidence against the captain was a bite mark on the victim's arm and lab coat that a prosecution expert matched to her husband's teeth. No weapon was found and prosecutors produced no one who witnessed the killing. With help from the University of Cincinnati's Innocence Project, Douglas Prade appealed the conviction and eventually won a ruling from the Ohio Supreme Court in 2010 that allowed the DNA evidence to be retested using newer methods. When the results came back, none of the DNA evidence could be matched to Douglas Prade. \"The defendant has been conclusively excluded as the contributor of the male DNA on the bite mark section of the lab coat or anywhere else,\" Hunter wrote in her 26-page ruling Tuesday. Hunter also cast serious doubt on the reliability of bite-mark evidence, leaving the prosecution with little to go on. \"The DNA results prove what Prade has said all along, that he is 100% innocent,\" Carrie Woods, Prade's Innocence Project lawyer, said after a hearing last summer. \"The Court is not unsympathetic to the family members, friends and community who want to see justice for Dr. Prade,\" Hunter wrote. \"However, the evidence that the defendant presented in this case is clear and convincing. Based on the review of the conclusive Y-STR DNA test results and the evidence from the 1998 trial, the court is firmly convinced that no reasonable juror would convict the defendant for the crime of aggravated murder with a firearm.\" She ordered that Prade be released from prison \"forthwith.\" Summit County law enforcement officials were dismayed at the decision. \"This is a gross misapplication of the law, and we will be appealing Prade's exoneration,\" county Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh said in a news release. \"All of the evidence clearly points to Prade as Dr. Margo Prade's killer,\" Akron Police Chief James Nice said in the same release. \"He was proven guilty in front of a jury using a substantial amount of other evidence.\" If Ohio's Ninth District Court of Appeals reverses Hunter's ruling, the state will have 30 days to file a motion seeking a new trial, Walsh's office said. \"I feel like my life is in danger and my family's life is in danger now. (Dr. Prade and her mother) are probably turning over in their graves, but God will have the final say,\" Tony Fowler, Margo Prade's nephew, told CNN affiliate WEWS. \"The decision is unfair and unjust, in my opinion,\" Tammy Fowler, a niece, told the station."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Douglas Prade, ex-police captain, was exonerated for his wife's 1997 murder, causing distress to Margo Prade's family.

Asked why, in spite of efforts by both Mexico and the United States, the leader Mexico's most powerful criminal organization -- the Sinaloa drug cartel -- remains at large, Napolitano implied it's only a matter of time before Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman falls. \"It took us 10 years to find Osama bin Laden and we found him,\" Napolitano said. \"And you know what happened there. I'm not suggesting the same thing would happen with Guzman but I am suggesting that we are persistent when it comes to wrongdoers and those who do harm in both of our countries.\" Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001, and both Mexican and U.S. authorities are offering multimillion-dollar rewards for information leading to his capture. Mexican reporters also asked whether the U.S. Homeland Security secretary still considers Mexico a safe destination. Twenty-two Carnival Cruise Lines passengers were robbed of valuables and their passports Saturday while they were traveling by bus in the middle of a shore excursion near the beach resort of Puerto Vallarta. Napolitano didn't specifically address that incident, but suggested she doesn't believe there is a generalized security problem. \"I think Americans come and go freely to Mexico all the time and I expect that to continue. It's a wonderful country. There are many, many places to go and to see. And obviously we also do a tremendous amount of commerce,\" Napolitano said. The meeting with Poire was Napolitano's first stop of a five-day regional tour that will also take her to Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama. Napoliticano was specifically asked whether the U.S. government is as concerned about the power of criminal organizations in Latin America as it is about terrorism. She called both terrorism and drug trafficking a global scourge, but pointed out there are important distinctions between the two. \"(Drug trafficking) has to be handled in a somewhat different way. It's a different type of crime and it's a different type of plague, but that's also why it is so important that we act not only bi-nationally, but in a regional way, to go after the supply of illegal narcotics,\" Napolitano said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Secretary Napolitano, on a five-day tour, met Minister Poire in Mexico City.

UPDATED: . 06:01 EST, 19 December 2012 . The number of people surviving till the age of 105 or more has almost doubled in less than a decade, official figures revealed yesterday. There are 640 Britons who have reached that grand old age or greater, compared with 350 in 2002, the Office for National Statistics, reveals. The number of 'super centenarians' \u2013 which experts classify as aged 110 or over \u2013 were\u00a0 unavailable but are also said to be rising fast. Experts predict Britain's ageing population will continue on the same trend, with more and more living far longer than their own parents or grandparents. While the extra years will be welcome to most, many will not have put aside enough to fund a long retirement or the periods of ill-health that can accompany old age. More are continuing in work after their official retirement date, with many finding that the returns on their pensions are far short of what they had expected. The majority of the 'super- elderly' are women, who normally live longer than men. Many wives survive their husbands by many years, or even decades. Of the 640 aged 105 and above in the UK in 2010 \u2013 the latest year for which figures are\u00a0 available \u2013 560 are women and 80 are men. The ONS also said the number of those who are aged 110 or more is rising 'year-on-year' in England and Wales, although\u00a0 it does not have an exact number. Many pensioners prefer to stay active in their old age and choose to go back to work . Overall, the figures, published . yesterday, show there are 12,640 people in the UK who are aged 100 or . over. This is a record and a number that is rising sharply every year . because of improved medical treatment, better nutrition and rising . living standards. William . Hunter, founder of Hunter Wealth Management, said: 'The old adage . about\u00a0 people living for \"three score years and ten\" is clearly over the . hill. 'Britons are healthier and living longer than ever before. But our finances are in much less rude health. 'As we live longer, pension companies are being forced\u00a0 to pay out for longer, and\u00a0 have of course passed those costs on.' Annuities \u2013 the income for life paid out by\u00a0 an insurance firm when you cash in your pension pot \u2013 have dropped dramatically, forcing many older people to keep on working. Nearly one million pensioners are working in Britain, the\u00a0 largest number since records began, according to official\u00a0 figures published last week by the ONS. Over the last year, the army of so-called 'grey workers' has increased by around 100,000, equal to around 270 pensioners every single day. At this level, it means nearly ten per cent of those who are\u00a0 65 and above have a job, with experts saying the number is almost guaranteed to keep on rising. For many pensioners, it is a positive choice. They enjoy their job, find it satisfying and are also keen to remain active in their old age. But many others are being forced into working \u2013 or even going back to work after retiring \u2013 because they simply cannot afford to stop. Laith Khalaf, a pensions\u00a0 analyst at the financial advisers, Hargreaves Lansdown, said the message is simple \u2013 if you want to retire young, start saving. He said: 'Living to a ripe old age is a blessing if you can afford it \u2013 but a curse if you can't. 'The Government is unwilling to pay for an ever-increasing time spent in retirement. 'Those without sufficient savings will be left at the mercy of the state pension.' Overall, the ONS said a typical man lives until the age of 85 in England and Wales, while a woman will typically survive until the age of 89. Since 1960, the average life span has jumped by around a decade for a man and eight years for a woman, it said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The UK's elderly population has surged, with 640 individuals aged 105 or more, the majority being women, and 12,640 aged 100 or more.

When her mother moved from Northumberland to Edinburgh to be near her parents earlier this year, she assumed the council would pay for the specialised piece of furniture. Sadie Fenton Hunt had to sleep surrounded by dog caging after her mother's bid for a special bed to keep her from crawling out at night and hurting herself was turned down . Ms Fenton was forced to think on her feet when the application was turned down. She used some furniture to steady the caging .

They were. The two had dated briefly in the 1980s. But Boatwright doesn't remember any of that. The 61-year-old Florida-born U.S. Navy vet woke up in a California hospital earlier this year speaking only Swedish. He had lived in Sweden off and on for about 20 years. Now, here he was at Goteborg Landvetter Airport, where that old friend, Ewa Espling, plans to help him get himself together in her country. \"I just want to be able to live a normal life and hopefully get my memory back,\" Boatwright said Tuesday. Boatwright has been diagnosed with dissociative amnesia, a rare psychiatric condition typically associated with a traumatic event. He says he has no memory of his past. Police found him unconscious in a Southern California Motel 6 in February. Navy vet wakes up, speaks only Swedish . Tuesday, Boatwright recalled that, waking up in the hospital this year, he looked at himself in the mirror and started crying. He didn't recognize the face looking back. When doctors tried to talk to him, he thought that his name was Johan Ek and that he was from Sweden. He didn't know why he had five tennis rackets in his hotel room. He was treated at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs. The hospital discharged him to Roy's Desert Resource Center, where he has spent the past two weeks. The Riverside County Department of Mental Health bought him a one-way ticket to Gothenburg after Boatwright made it clear that he wants to live in Sweden. Boatwright said Tuesday that he is grateful for all of the help he has received. In the United States, Boatwright said, he felt like a stranger in his own country because he didn't speak the language: English. In Sweden, he feels safe and more calm and believes he'll be able to start rebuilding his life. \"I think it's the best solution for Michael, because he can't speak English,\" Espling said. \"To recover fully, I think he needs to come where he's safe and understands what's happening around him.\" Before Tuesday, Espling and Boatwright hadn't seen each other since 1984. Espling has arranged for a place for Boatwright to live in Sweden. She said she will try to assist as much as she can while he works through rebuilding his life. \"He's going to have a home as long as he needs it,\" she said. She identified Boatwright in a Swedish newspaper article this year. \"Michael asked me, 'Why are you doing this for me?' Because I know Michael would have done the same thing for me. If he had found me in the papers. This is a very nice man with a very big heart,\" Espling said. In an exclusive CNN interview this month, Boatwright said he suffers from recurring nightmares too disturbing to describe. Boatwright said he is pleased to be in Sweden and wants to start working once he gets his memory back. He hopes to become a tennis instructor because, in his view, it's the one thing he's good at. Boatwright compared his life to an empty chalkboard. \"After death, this is probably the worst thing you could ever go through,\" he said. Small pieces are starting to come back, however. Recently, a Swedish song called \"Sol, vind och vatten\" (\"Sun, Wind and Water\") popped into his head as if it were on repeat all day long. He had no idea where it came from. He doesn't recall any experiences that he and Espling shared in the 1980s, but some emotional remnants of the past remain.

Samantha Elauf was 17 when she interviewed for a 'model' position, as the company calls its sales staff, at an Abercrombie Kids store in a shopping mall in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 2008. She\u00a0never explicitly voiced her religious views or her need to wear a headscarf but the assistant store manager correctly assumed she was a Muslim. She impressed the assistant store manager, who then consulted a manager and explained that she thought Elauf wore the scarf for religious reasons - but the manager said the headscarf wasn't permitted even if it was worn because of Elauf's religion, according to the suit. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Samantha Elauf, pictured outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday, was turned down for a sales staff position at an Abercrombie & Fitch store in 2008 because she was wearing a headscarf . Support: Elauf is pictured with her mother Majda Elauf, left, and P. David Lopez, General Counsel of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), as they leave the Supreme Court in Washington . The\u00a0headscarf, or hijab, conflicted with the company's Look Policy, a code derived from Abercrombie's focus on what it calls East Coast collegiate or preppy style. Abercrombie has said it didn't violate the law because it never got 'direct, explicit notice' from Elauf that her practice conflicted with the company's policy. At the time of the interview, the policy required employees to dress in a way that's consistent with the clothing Abercrombie sells, and it prohibited wearing headscarves or anything in black. The company has said it changed its headscarf policy as early as 2010, but the ban on black clothing remains. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit on Elauf's behalf, and a jury eventually awarded her $20,000. But the federal appeals court in Denver threw out the award and concluded that Abercrombie & Fitch could not be held liable because Elauf never asked the company to relax its policy against headscarves. 'Discrimination': Elauf now works in merchandising for Urban Outfitters and has a fashion blog . Fighting back: The company said Elauf never asked them to relax its policy in line with her religious practice . '[A]n applicant or employee cannot remain silent before the employer regarding the religious nature of his or her conflicting practice and need for an accommodation and still hope to prevail in a religion-accommodation case,' Abercrombie wrote in a brief. 'Abercrombie expends a great deal of effort to ensure that its target customers receive a holistically brand-based, sensory experience. To Abercrombie, a Model who violates the Look Policy by wearing inconsistent clothing inaccurately represents the brand, causes consumer confusion, fails to perform an essential function of the position, and ultimately damages the brand.' Elauf now works for Urban Outfitters and also runs a fashion blog. The case being argued Wednesday explores when an employer must take steps to accommodate the religious beliefs of a worker or job applicant. Organizations of state and local governments are supporting the company out of concerns that, if the EEOC prevails, they would be subject to more discrimination claims as large employers. Battle: Elauf is pictured outside the federal courthouse in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma in 2011. The Supreme Court is now considering her employment discrimination claim . Muslim, Christian and Jewish advocacy organizations have weighed in on Elauf's side, as have gay-rights groups. A legal brief on behalf of Orthodox Jews argues that requiring job applicants to voice the need for religion-related special treatment makes them less likely to be hired, with no reason given for the decision. Orthodox Jews who wear a skullcap, or yarmulke, or who may not work on Saturdays are routinely advised to withhold that information until after they are hired, lawyer Nathan Lewin said in his Supreme Court filing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In 2008, Samantha Elauf was denied a job at Abercrombie & Fitch due to her headscarf, violating the 'Look Policy'.

A three-year-old girl may have tried to change her tiny brother\u2019s nappy just moments before he suffocated to death in his cot, an inquest heard today. The little girl was alone in the room in Witney, Oxfordshire, with six-month-old baby Feonyx Clarke before he was discovered lying limp and face down with four or five nappy bags near his head. The coroner, who would not name the girl, recorded an open verdict on the death - after saying it was possible his sister was trying to change his nappy on her own while their mother was downstairs. 'Very sad and tragic': Feonyx Clarke, of Witney, Oxfordshire, was discovered lying limp and face down with four or five nappy bags near his head . Kirsty Clarke, their mother, had earlier told the hearing that her daughter - referred to in the inquest as \u2018T\u2019 - may have tried to change Feonyx in his cot in an upstairs room without her knowledge. Despite the best efforts of paramedics and doctors, Feonyx could not be saved and was certified dead almost 24 hours later at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.

The unused nappy bags which were found in Feonyx\u2019s cot had not been there when his mother checked on him 20 minutes earlier.

I can\u2019t exclude it. It could be suffocation or it could be a naturally occurring collapse with an unknown cause, which then goes onto cause these symptoms.\u2019 Feonyx was also found to be suffering from bronchopneumonia as he had been unwell in the days leading to his death. Treatment: Despite the best efforts of paramedics and doctors, Feonyx could not be saved and was certified dead almost 24 hours after being found limp at John Radcliffe Hospital (pictured) in Oxford . Mrs Clarke, 27 - newly married to waste collector Gavin - provided a police statement following the baby\u2019s death. \u2018There were some toys at the bottom of the cot which he could not reach. He had a snuggle over him. Apart from that there was nothing in the cot,\u2019 she said. The full-time mother collected her oldest child \u2018N\u2019 from school with her father watching over Feonyx. She came back after 4pm. 'I lifted Feonyx out of his cot - he was limp. I checked on his wrist for a pulse. He didn\u2019t appear to breathing' Kirsty Clarke . \u2018At about 5pm \u2018T\u2019 went upstairs. She was three years old at this time and \u2018N\u2019 seven,\u2019 her statement said. 'I went up after her to see what she was doing. \u2018She got back into my bed and went straight to sleep. I checked on Feonyx. He was warm so I removed his blanket and then went back downstairs. \u2018Between about 5.20pm or 5.30pm I went back up to check on him. He was lying face down on some nappy bags. Also in the cot was a clean nappy with a bag of baby wipes. \u2018They had not been in the cot at 5pm when I had changed him. T was still in my bed. She was under my duvet, so I do not know whether she was asleep or not. I lifted Feonyx out of his cot - he was limp. 'I checked on his wrist for a pulse. He didn\u2019t appear to breathing. I started CPR and called 999. I did CPR until paramedics arrived. They then took him to hospital.\u2019 Inquest: The coroner recorded an open verdict on the death at Oxford Coroner's Court (pictured) - after saying it was possible his sister was trying to change his nappy on her own while their mother was downstairs . She said that Feonyx, born on November 8, 2012, was a \u2018bubbly and playful\u2019 child, who had only seen his health visitor and doctor for routine baby check-ups and eight-week injections. During evidence, brunette Kirsty told the hearing: \u2018He was teething and had a cold the days before and was a bit more sleepy (than normal). I remember nappy bags in the cot. \u2018I don\u2019t remember if his face was on . them. They were at the top of the cot. There were four or five loose . nappy bags. At 5pm there were no nappy bags, no wipes and no nappies (in . his cot). There was no bed in his room. T was in another room.\u2019 'It was a very sad and tragic death' Darren Salter, Oxfordshire Coroner . Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter asked her: \u2018It is possible that T may have tried perhaps to change Feonyx? That would be an explanation wouldn\u2019t it?' Mrs Clarke replied: \u2018Yes.\u2019 She said nappy bags would normally be kept on a window sill. Feonyx died at 1.18pm on May 25, 2013. Coroner Mr Salter said: \u2018All I can say is repeat what Dr Gould said. The suffocation on nappy bags is possible and can\u2019t be fully excluded, but there is no direct evidence at the post-mortem of it. \u2018The best thing for me to do is return what is called an open verdict where the evidence at the inquest doesn\u2019t fully show what the cause of death is. \u2018I think the most likely aspect of this was that it was a natural cause, but it is hard to determine what that natural cause was. It was a very sad and tragic death.\u2019 Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Feonyx Clarke, a six-month-old, may have suffocated while his three-year-old sister tried to change his nappy, an inquest found.

Convictions: Jan Morales has a 40-year history of appalling crimes yet was allowed to work as a paramedic . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered an investigation into how the owner of a fleet of ambulances was allowed to drive vehicles and work as a paramedic \u2013 despite criminal convictions for kidnapping, assault and child pornography. The move follows serious concerns raised by a senior judge after The Mail on Sunday reported how health regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) granted the firm a licence. Jan Morales, co-owner of Staffordshire-based International Medical Assistance, has a string of convictions going back more than 40 years. Despite his history he had access to keys to the front doors of patients who might have to call for help. Now, after blasting the inadequate checks done on Morales by the CQC, the Care Standards Tribunal has referred the case to Mr Hunt. Earlier this year The Mail on Sunday reported that CQC granted the registration in full knowledge of Morales\u2019s 21 child pornography\u00a0 offences, for which he was jailed in 2005. But it took the CQC until this month to stop him from working with patients, even though he was on the sex offenders\u2019 register. The MoS has been told by senior sources in the private ambulance industry that dozens of companies have never been properly inspected. Even before Morales\u2019s firm was approved, concerns had been raised. \u2018It is clear at the time of the assessment for registration, Staffordshire Police had disclosed that Mr Morales had been convicted of offences relating to child pornography,\u2019 said tribunal judge Gillian Irving QC. \u2018We found it astonishing as the facts of this case materialised that a man with the forensic history of\u00a0 Mr Morales was able to hold the position of director in a company such as this. 'It was difficult to\u00a0 imagine anyone less suitable or appropriate.\u2019 Inquiry: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered an investigation into how Morales was allowed to drive emergency vehicles . Observing that users of private ambulance services are \u2018some of the most vulnerable in our society\u2019, the judge worried that there is no requirement for staff to be checked through the Criminal Records Bureau. A spokesman for the CQC said: \u2018We acknowledge that we should not have registered the private ambulance provider. CQC have written to the Secretary of State to make him aware of this case.\u2019 The Department of Health said: \u2018This is clearly wrong and never should have happened. We are currently looking into tightening safeguarding measures.\u2019 Concerns: Andy Burnham . NHS bosses are increasingly using \u2018poorly trained\u2019 private ambulance crews for the most serious 999 calls as the crisis in emergency care worsens. In London the bill for using private ambulances has gone up ten-fold in two years to more than \u00a34\u2009million due to cuts and an increase in calls. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: \u2018Whistleblowers have contacted Labour with concerns that even the most serious 999 calls are being handled by private ambulances without properly trained staff.\u2019 Gary Palmer, from the GMB union, which represents paramedics, said: \u2018The training of the private crews can often be less than for an NHS ambulance.\u2019 A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: \u2018The NHS is seeing an extra one million more patients each year in A&E and despite the additional workload is coping well.\u2019"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Amid an emergency care crisis, Jeremy Hunt is probing how Jan Morales, a criminal on the sex offenders\u2019 register, was allowed to work in private ambulance services.

Eric Pickles revealed the Tories are now looking at setting down 'minimum standards', making it more difficult for local authorities to offer fortnightly collections . Eric Pickles has threatened to introduce new laws forcing councils to bring back weekly bin collections after admitting the Government\u2019s previous efforts have done no more than slow the decline. The Communities Secretary said it had taken Labour ten years to \u2018destroy\u2019 the traditional weekly service and suggested it would take as long to restore it. He revealed the Tories are now looking at setting down \u2018minimum standards\u2019, making it more difficult for local authorities to offer fortnightly collections. Councils should also be forced to publicise when long-running\u00a0 contracts with waste firms are up for renewal, giving voters a chance\u00a0 to demand a return to a weekly service, he said. Admitting his frustration at the lack of progress so far, Mr Pickles told the Daily Mail: \u2018If people get impatient with me, so be it. They aren\u2019t as impatient as I am.\u2019 The minister, who argues weekly rubbish collections are a \u2018fundamental right\u2019, has been under increasing pressure over his repeated pledges before the election to reverse the trend towards a fortnightly service that began under Labour. But the proportion of councils operating black bag collections every other week has increased from 57 per cent in 2010 to 69 per cent last year. Most councils have shunned a \u00a3250million fund set up by Mr Pickles to pay for the reintroduction of weekly services. Instead, the cash has been used to support the retention of weekly services in areas which still offer them. Mr Pickles\u2019 Department for Communities and Local Government only has authority over councils in England, where it says its efforts have slowed down the movement towards fortnightly bin collections. Mr Pickles insisted the Government had safeguarded weekly collections for six million households in England. File picture . In parts of Scotland and Wales, where the department has no say, some councils are even considering collecting black bag rubbish only once every three weeks. Mr Pickles insisted the Government had safeguarded weekly collections for six million households in England, with four million more still getting them from councils outside the scheme. He said he had also abolished plans for new bin taxes and changed the law to scrap unfair fines for people who do not put\u00a0 rubbish out correctly. \u2018If we hadn\u2019t done what we have, we would have virtually no weekly\u00a0 collections. We\u2019ve certainly saved six million, but it\u2019s a process,\u2019 the minister said. \u2018It was always going to be very difficult to take on the bin barons, take on the industry and stand up for what ordinary punters want.\u2019 Mr Pickles said he wanted to amend Labour\u2019s Household Waste Recycling Act 2003 to include the minimum standards. \u2018It would make it more difficult to do fortnightly collections and set out the type of collection that had to be made weekly,\u2019 he added."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Eric Pickles, with the Department for Communities and Local Government, aims to enforce weekly bin collections by amending Labour\u2019s Household Waste Recycling Act 2003.

That\u2019s why he wins many balls that normal players don\u2019t win. \u2018His transition from offence to defence is very quick and he wins the ball back very quickly and he can take advantage of that.\u2019 This latest reverse for Sunderland leaves them with just a single win to go with five draws and three defeats. Manager Gus Poyet insisted he was heartened by the response to last week\u2019s drubbing but was disappointed that individual errors had again been so costly. \u2018It\u2019s difficult to analyse the game because the commitment, reaction, desire and organisation compared to last week was there,\u2019 he said. \u2018But we forgot to leave the mistakes in the dressing room.\u2019 Poyet also said his team were angry. \u2018They fought hard for the result and two actions cost us.\u2019 But he believes Sunderland\u2019s problem is psychological rather than any technical or tactical issue. \u2018We\u2019re getting paid to win games and we\u2019ve won one and need to change that,\u2019 he said. \u2018It\u2019s about character now, being brave enough to go on the pitch and believe we can win.\u2019 Poyet made two changes to his starting line-up, bring in Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson as Jordi Gomez and Connor Wickham dropped to the bench.

Sunderland pushed forward at the start and had the first sight of goal in the second minute, Rodwell heading wide from Will Buckley\u2019s cross. If that looked promising it was a false dawn because their only other efforts that carried threat in the first half were headers from John O\u2019Shea and Rodwell, and both of those were blocked. Arsenal\u2019s first chance was in the seventh minute from a corner taken by Santi Cazorla. It was headed clear only as far as Kieran Gibbs, but he lashed wide from the edge of the area. Cazorla fed Sanchez a minute later and he also shot and missed. At the other end, Brown nodded on to O\u2019Shea, whose header was blocked. Then came the clearest chance up to that point of the match when Danny Welbeck, who received the ball on the left corner of the area, switched it on to his right foot and smacked the ball just over. Gibbs was booked for taking out Johnson, the first of a spate of yellows cards either side of the break, with Welbeck and Mikel Arteta among others to go into Kevin Friend\u2019s book. Welbeck was booked for an alleged dive in the second half but it looked a harsh decision because his movement was impeded by O\u2019Shea. Arteta\u2019s booking five minutes after that was arguably lenient, for a high kick on Rodwell that might well have given him a facial injury. Arsenal went ahead in the 30th minute thanks to Brown\u2019s error in the centre circle. First, he failed to control a simple pass from a team-mate and then he made a hash of an attempted back pass, twisting his kicking leg and making minimal contact with the ball. In doing so, he gave possession to Sanchez with nobody between the Chilean forward and the Sunderland goal. Sanchez dashed forward and chipped over Mannone. Cazorla had a chance to extend the lead three minutes later but his left-footed shot flew wide right. On the hour, Sanchez\u2019s effort from outside the box forced a save from Mannone and then another former Arsenal man, Seb Larsson, elicited a save from Wojciech Szczesny at the other end. Jozy Altidore, on as a substitute for Rodwell, headed on target and Szczesny saved again. Sanchez rubbed Sunderland\u2019s noses in it with his late second goal when Mannone was clearly at fault. \u2018Vito has been educated at Arsenal so of course I have some sympathy,\u2019 Wenger said. \u2018He is like anyone else [at Sunderland], his confidence has dropped a little bit because of the defeat last week. But he has shown his qualities since he arrived here and will show that again.\u2019 Arsenal must demonstrate their own, more clearly and more often.

UPDATED: . 16:16 EST, 21 September 2013 . Hamzah Khan's father, Aftab, told police a year before the toddler's death that his son was being neglected. Tapes of the conversation were played at the manslaughter trial of the boy's mother, Amanda Hutton . The devastated father of the four-year-old boy allegedly starved to death by his mother had begged police to check on the child before his death, a court has heard. Tapes were played at the manslaughter trial of tragic Hamazah Khan's mother, Amanda Hutton, of the conversation between Aftab Khan and police in 2008, following his arrest for an assault on Hutton. During the conversation, he repeatedly told officers of his concern for his son and issued a chilling warning to them when he said: 'When it all comes out I will come back and say I told you so... you guys aren't listening.' Hamzah was found dead in his cot in September 2011 and had been there for 21 months. On the tape, he also accused Hutton of being 'bitter and twisted' and an alcoholic. 'Get a doctor to check the kid (Hamzah). I want you to check Hamzah, get a doctor to check him and check how undernourished he is and how neglected he is. 'There's something wrong with that kid.' Asked if he had taken his son to the doctor, Aftab, who said he had been with Hutton 'on and off for 22 years' and who later admitted the assault on her in court, said: 'She will not let me. I've told her time and time again, there's something wrong with him, take him to the doctors. 'I changed his nappy when she'd left him for about a day and a half because of the drink problem.I can't do anything. She's overpowering. Go and live with her and you'll see the big bad story. 'It all boils down to she's an alcoholic she won't listen to anybody. I'll report her to the social services.The authorities can't be bothered. I will get the social services involved, you aren't listening. 'So if anything else happens afterwards you guys know about it. 'This is the problem, authorities, you don't believe the right people. She's a bitter and twisted woman and there's something seriously wrong with her. 'She don't brush her teeth, she don't clean herself, she don't look after herself. She's an alcoholic.' The brother of Hamzah Khan (pictured) has told a jury how he saw the child sleeping in a buggy that stank of urine . He also confirmed police had been called to the house on eight separate occasions in the two-and-a-half years up to 2008. Detective Inspector Ian Lawrie told the court officers visited the home . in Bradford, West Yorks., after the interview. The court is due to hear . evidence from officers in relation to that visit. On trial: Amanda Hutton faces manslaughter charges after her son Hamzah Khan's decomposed body was found at home 21 months after his death . Bradford Crown Court also heard evidence from Hamzah's brother, Qaiser Khan, 22, who said his sibling had 'appeared neglected', and had been sleeping in a cot which 'stank of urine'. He also claimed he had witnessed the child eating the contents of his nappy. Mr Khan told a jury at Bradford Crown Court how he went to the house between December 2008 and March 2009. He said Hamzah slept upright in a urine-soaked buggy that 'stank'. Mr Khan said his brother was left in a dirty nappy and he witnessed him eating the contents. 'Hamzah appeared neglected,' Mr Khan said. He explained to the jury: 'I was only at the house for a couple of days. The buggy smelled so bad of urine I got disinfectant and cleaned it out.' Mr Khan was also asked about a text message sent from his phone to Hutton in December 2008. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, said the text said: 'Watch out Monday you b****. I\u2019m going to go to the police station to report you for child neglect and abuse. Look at Hamzah.' Mr Khan said he did not remember sending it. Asked by Stephen Meadowcroft QC, defending, if he was exaggerating what was happening at the house because he had a bad relationship with his mother, Mr Khan said: 'I\u2019ve seen this with my own eyes.' Mr Khan told the court that when he was aged about 13, he was made to drink 'mouldy, off milk' by his mother as punishment. He said his mother would spend her days drinking. 'She would go upstairs and drink and then I wouldn\u2019t see her for most of the day,' he said. Earlier, Mr Khan refused to answer any questions when he first stepped into the witness box. But after a break he returned to court to give his evidence. Qaiser Khan, 22, was giving evidence on the third day of the trial of his mother Amanda Hutton, who denies the manslaughter of her son Hamzah Khan . The prosecution has told the court Hutton starved her son to death. The defendant told police her son died after he was taken ill. Mr Meadowcroft said he was suggesting that Hutton was coping before Hamza\u2019s death. The barrister said: 'The child died tragically and it wasn\u2019t her fault. After that, she collapsed.' Mr Khan said: 'Urined buggy - was that coping? That was before 2009. 'It was quite clear she wasn\u2019t coping. She hadn\u2019t cleaned the house up and she didn\u2019t clean the nappies.'

This is not a geographic truism, but a strategic imperative. Generations of Americans, distracted by far-flung crises, have long taken our own region for granted. This must change if the 21st century is to be an American century. The United States, Canada and Mexico are bound by a shared economic, environmental, demographic and cultural destiny. How we move forward together is key to our success. In recognition of our shared destiny, the three countries should create a North American passport that would, over time, allow their citizens to travel, work, invest, learn and innovate anywhere in North America.  Work, tourist and student visas are necessities in the modern world to regulate the flow of people between sovereign states. In the North American context, much like within the European Union, our economies and societies are far more integrated than our immigration system recognizes -- and a North American passport, much like the EU passport, would align our laws with reality. Podcast: A North American passport? Such a move would provide a dramatic break from Washington's historical negligence of its  \"near abroad,\" which stems from a rare luxury. In contrast to other major continental powers through the centuries, the United States has not had to worry much about its neighbors and devote the bulk of its military resources to protecting its borders. With no real threat next door, the United States has felt free to roam elsewhere in the world, as unconstrained and secure as if we were an island nation. Meanwhile, our neighbors bolster our prosperity.  Mexico and Canada are now the top two export markets for the United States, and two of our top three trading partners overall. Trade has exploded in the two decades since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which has created an integrated manufacturing platform and labor market. Canada, a stalwart ally that embodies the best of our shared democratic values, has long been the No. 1 source of imported oil to the United States, with Mexico usually coming second or third. The North American region has become the fastest-growing producer of oil and natural gas in the world and will surpass Saudi Arabia and OPEC within a decade or two as the global energy leader. This potential must be leveraged regionally, with cross-border infrastructure investments and environmental planning. Even if Washington still thinks in terms of tidy lines separating nation states, mineral resources are about as influenced by such lines on a map as the water gushing down the Colorado River. Mexico, an emerging powerhouse with more than 100 million people, is striving to consolidate its democratic gains and become a predominantly middle-class society. The United States has a strong stake in this effort. Mexico is the linchpin to our relations with the countries of Central and South America. The economic prosperity, education and security of Mexico's people will help determine the overall competitiveness of North America on the global stage. Moreover, Americans on this side of the Rio Grande must acknowledge the \"Mexicanness\" in the United States and treat Mexicans living here with the dignity and respect they deserve. The inception of NAFTA marked an important step toward leveraging these geographic realities for a shared North American success. NAFTA has been a boon to our growth and competitiveness. Integrated production platforms, sometimes spanning all three countries, have helped draw manufacturing back from competitors across the Pacific. But the promise of NAFTA has fallen short in a critical respect; while trade and investment have grown, the barriers to movement have remained too high for the people who help drive and stand to benefit from that growth. As evidenced by the recent political firestorm over President Obama's executive move to allow more undocumented workers to avoid deportation, it would take farsighted and courageous political leadership in all three countries to press for a North American passport. But the fact is that allowing North Americans to move more effortlessly across the borders would help alleviate our contentious domestic immigration battles. We have more than 10 million undocumented immigrants in this country because we didn't create a realistic, legal avenue for the number of Mexicans who would -- and should, given our level of integration -- come to the United States over time.  Moreover, by erecting a wall along the border and making crossings so difficult, costly and dangerous, we have interrupted the old \"circularity\" of migratory flows, trapping millions of workers on this side of the border. If we established a North American passport and adapted our legal framework to economic realities, allowing people to move within our North American economy, we wouldn't need to debate whether to offer more than 10 million people U.S. citizenship.   Even a few years ago, immigration was a far more polarizing issue in states like Arizona. Now the tide is slowly changing. More Republicans are recognizing that their prior stance on immigration needs to change if they want to win over voters in the next presidential election. A North American passport would reflect the unique relationship and shared interests among our nations. In the face of growing competition from rising powers elsewhere in the world, simply taking our geography for granted and focusing our attention elsewhere is no longer a viable option."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A North American passport would represent the integrated economies of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, the U.S.'s main export markets.

Over 10 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. highlight NAFTA's shortcomings. Republicans are slowly changing their stance on immigration."}]}

An Army sergeant has been charged with secretly photographing and videotaping at least a dozen women at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, including in a bathroom and showers. The Army said on Wednesday that Sgt 1st Class Michael McClendon is facing charges of dereliction of duty, mistreatment, entering a women's bathroom without notice, and taking and possessing inappropriate photos and videos of women who were naked or in various states of undress. The women have been notified by the Army about the matter. Accusation: An Army sergeant at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, pictured, has been charged with secretly photographing and videotaping at least a dozen women . Shocking allegations: The Army says it has notified the female cadets about the matter . McClendon, who is a combat engineer and joined the military in 1990, was assigned to the academy from 2009 to this month. He was a member of the support staff at West Point, working with cadets. He was charged on May 14 with violating four articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, but some of the allegations date back to 2009. He has been transferred to Fort Drum, New York. The case is the latest in an embarrassing series of arrests and incidents of sexual misconduct across the military, and comes on the heels of a Pentagon report that estimated that as many as 26,000 service members may have been sexually assaulted last year. 'The Army is committed to ensuring the safety and welfare of our Cadets at the Military Academy at West Point - as well as all soldiers throughout our Army,' said Gen John Campbell, vice chief of staff of the Army, in a statement. Startling trend: The case is the latest in an embarrassing series of arrests and incidents of sexual misconduct across the military . 'Once notified of the violation, a full investigation was launched, followed by swift action to correct the problem. Our cadets must be confident that issues such as these are handled quickly and decisively, and that our system will hold those responsible accountable.' The charges, first reported by The New York Times, detail that he took videos of various women's body parts without their consent. And the charges note that the videos have been recovered. According to the Army, McClendon was relieved of his duties on May 17, 2012, and was ordered to have no contact with cadets and was barred from entering cadet areas on the post. The yearlong delay in formally charging McClendon was because of the complexities of the case and the effort to recover the forensic evidence. McClendon, who is from Blakely, Georgia, is doing military duty at Fort Drum, and is not being held in a jail. Growing problem: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, left, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey, right, have been asked by President Obama to lead a process to root out the problem of sexual abuse within the U.S. military . Army spokesman George Wright said that throughout the notification process, the Army will protect the privacy of the individuals involved as well as offer support services as required. In recent weeks, military leaders have expressed anger and shame over their failure to stem the escalating sexual abuse across the services. In a meeting last week with defense and military officials, President Obama asked Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Martin Dempsey to lead a process to root out the problem.

The 'Bluewater Classic' in its 70th staging is the first real competitive test for Comanche, which has been specially built for distance racing and speed record attempts, the brainchild of Netscape co-founder Jim Clark and his wife, Kristy Hinze-Clark, who was born in Australia. Comanche, skippered by American Ken Read and with a strong international crew, is expected to battle it out for line honors with seven-time winner Wild Oats XI in the 628-nautical miles race, one of the highlights of the international yachting calendar. The traditional Boxing Day start from Sydney Harbor saw an early glimpse of Comanche's speed with the skipper of Wild Oats XI, Mark Richards, moved to exclaim: \"She's smoking -- look at that thing go!\" Out to sea and past the first mark in an unofficial record time, Comanche led from Wild Oats XI with the other supermaxis Ragamuffin and Perpetual Loyal giving chase. The race, which runs down the east coast of Australia and across the Bass Strait to the Tasmanian capital Hobart, has drawn a 117-strong entry, the biggest since 1994.

Clark watched from a supporting boat as his wife was part of the crew when Comanche took part in the Big Boat Challenge in Sydney Harbor on December 9, won by Wild Oats XI. But the short race was just a small taster for the bigger test and Hinze-Clark opted out of competing, two days before the start, due to fears her inexperience might hamper the race favorite in predicted difficult conditions.

Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and first lady Michelle Obama embrace while meeting Wednesday in London. While meeting Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in London on Wednesday, the two women briefly embraced -- not your typical scene at Buckingham Palace. The British media called it everything from a breach of protocol to an extraordinary show of affection from the queen. The Times of London proclaimed it a \"touching moment,\" and the palace apparently agreed. \"This was a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation between the queen and Michelle Obama,\" a palace spokeswoman said. CNN's Carol Costello talked about the moment Thursday with Charles Mosley, author of \"Blood Royal,\" on CNN's \"American Morning.\" CNN: According to our tabloids in the United States, the meeting went really well. What's your take? Mosley: Absolutely. What is astounding is the picture of the queen with her arm around Michelle Obama and Michelle Obama's hand around the queen, too. But the queen made the first move. This is the most astounding thing because the queen is not known for being touchy-feely. Indeed, her son Prince Charles complained on one occasion that he wasn't given enough affection when he was a child. She's obviously a late developer. CNN: What's the big deal [about touching the queen]? Mosley: The big deal is that the queen is normally a sacred person. In monarchies, there's a sacredness that surrounds the sovereign, which is perhaps not known in republics, at least not all the time in the way that it is in a monarchy. She's been on the throne a very, very long time, and she is herself a very dignified person, all the more so because of her relatively short stature.

Mosley: Not a bad one at all. The queen is actually quite technologically advanced. She uses e-mail to a much greater extent than most members of the royal family and particularly much more than her son, who is a bit of a technophobe. CNN: [The queen gave the president a silver-framed photograph of herself and her husband.] Was it a recent picture of the queen and Prince Philip at least? Mosley: That I don't know. If it's the same as she gives everybody, it must be a sort of middle period picture because it would have to cover so many years.

She found three-month-old Bobby Blakemore unresponsive the next morning and despite attempts at resuscitation he was declared dead at the scene. Three-month-old Bobby Blakemore was found dead after sharing a double bed with his mother, an inquest in Bolton heard . The Bolton hearing was told Bobby was born prematurely at 34 weeks and had weighed 5lbs 3 oz, but had been feeding well and there had been no medical concerns. Miss Williams of Clifton, near Swinton, Greater Manchester, told the hearing her son had a routine in which he would wake up in the morning at around 7am. The company team leader said: 'I would wake up about 12 and then 3am, he always struggled to get back to sleep after the 3 o'clock feed.' On October 19 last year Bobby's father Liam Blakemore, an insurance worker, took him out before returning before 1pm. The youngster slept until 2.45pm before waking for a feed and was a 'bit sick.'\u00a0After that he was said to be fine. Bobby had another feed at 6.30pm before being placed in his pram where he fell asleep. That evening Miss Williams was joined at her home by a work colleague and she had a glass of wine before going to bed - leaving her friend to sleep on her sofa. The inquest was told that Bobby did have a Moses basket but Miss Williams said: 'He didn't like sleeping in it, he had a crib in our room. 'That night I put him in our bed instead of putting him in the crib. I wanted to be with him. I was playing songs he liked listening to.' Little Bobby ,pictured with his father Liam Blakemore, had been perfectly healthy before he died . She said she lay on her back and put herself between Bobby and the adjacent bedroom wall and covered them both with the duvet. She woke at around 6am to find Bobby unresponsive . Despite mouth-to-mouth resuscitation attempts and instructions from a 999 operator, Bobby was pronounced dead at the scene. When asked by the coroner Alan Walsh if she had been aware of any overlying Miss Williams replied 'no.' She said that when she woke Bobby was in the same position in which she had left him. The NHS advise that the safest place for a baby to sleep in its first six months is in a cot in its parents room. They advise against sharing a bed if either parent is a smoker, has recently drunk alcohol, taken medication or drugs that make them sleep more heavily or are tired. They say the risks of sharing a bed with an infant are also increased if they were born premature or were of a low birth weight. The NHS say there is also a risk parents could role over in their sleep and suffocate their baby. Or the child could get caught between the wall and the bed, or roll out of an adult bed and be injured. She also said that he hadn't cried in the night. The pathologist who carried out the post mortem examination was unable to ascertain a cause of death for the child. Recording a narrative cause of death Mr Walsh said: 'It's accepted in some case that prematurity is a factor in sudden unexpected death. 'Although born prematurely Bobby did grow and thrive and that's largely due to the good care he was given by his parents. 'He was obviously well fed and cared for and well looked after by parents that cared and helped him to overcome the immediate dangers of prematurity. 'He was placed in bed with Angela because she wanted to be close to him that day. 'He usually slept in a crib, sadly he didn't disturb his mother that night and she found him in the morning unresponsive. 'It's important that some of the factors that arise in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome are given as a warning, there is nothing to suggest that is the cause of death. 'Prematurity is one of the factors, co-sleeping is another factor as well as overheating and smoking. I'm satisfied there was no smoking in the house.

Final cut: The script developed by Mr Fleming and Whittingham eventually became the film Thunderball, starring Sean Connery (pictured) Mr Fleming wrote: 'My concern is... to make it as fast-moving and packed with incidents as possible. To my mind the chief weakness is the thinness of the Mafia threat and this must be considerably strengthened. 'I am badly in need of good Italian names for the Mafia gangsters and these could perhaps be obtained from the Venice telephone directory! 'In order to keep the feet of this film firmly on the ground production will have to be particularly brisk so as not to allow the audience time to worry about probabilities. 'Production will have to be particularly strong in portraying the Secret Service and the Mafia. Any suspicion of cardboard must be avoided and the acting throughout should be under-played and without exaggeration. 'More subsidiary incidents should be added where there is any sign of the pace flagging but, for the time being, my invention has run out.' Novel: Mr Fleming later turned the script into a . novel (right) but did not credit Mr Whittingham or his producer, who . had helped craft it. A court case later awarded Mr Whittingham the film . rights to the book. The finished screenplay, right, is part of the . auction lot . Although the scrip was finalised, plans for the film were shelved in 1960 due to a disagreement with producer Kevin McClory. Mr Fleming went on to write Thunderball as a novel in 1961, but in doing so failed to credit Whittingham and McClory for their input. The case was settled out of court in November 1963 and McClory was awarded the film rights for Thunderball, which premiered in 1965, a year after Fleming's death. The memo along with a first draft 'continuity treatment' for Thunderball by Whittingham, and first draft shooting script for the film that are all for sale now were used as evidence in the case. Katherine Schofield, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'Fleming decided in 1958 to turn one of his James Bond books into a film and this pre-dated Dr No by four years. Titles: Pages of the memo up for auction show potential titles for the film which would become Thunderball . 'The memo is Fleming's thoughts of what the film would be. He was an amazing novelist but found it difficult to convert his work to the big screen which is why he employed Whittingham. 'Fleming is saying in the memo \"let's do it like this\". One idea he had was to use the Mafia as the bad guys which is different to what was eventually made. 'But the most significant item for sale is the original final edition script because that is the script for the very first Bond movie.' The memo, Whittingham's first draft treatment and first draft shooting script are expected to sell for \u00a35,000 each. The final edition script for Thunderball is tipped to go under the hammer for \u00a312,000 in the auction in London on December 18."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ian Fleming's memo to Jack Whittingham outlined a Bond film with Mafia villains.

He wants the biggest job of the lot. This is his England dream; a vision and a philosophy that he believes will get the best out of the country\u2019s players under his guidance. It feels good to hear someone care so much. \u2018Everyone has dreams of playing for England and my dream after football is to manage England,\u2019 he revealed. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rio Ferdinand's factfile: His clubs and trophies . Dream: Rio Ferdinand, sat in the dugout while injured at the 2010 World Cup, wants to manage England one day . Making his point: Ferdinand spoke of his desire to 'put a few noses out of joint' at the FA . On his way: Ferdinand has started coaching and he is enthusiastic about his future in the dugout . Badge of honour: The former England defender wants all his qualifications before he starts coaching . \u2018I don\u2019t expect the chance now, but once I get the badges I am there. If I don\u2019t get a job in management I will wonder why.\u2019 Ferdinand started out on the coaching pathway when his career at Manchester United came to a close. It fills him with enthusiasm and now he wants more. To listen to him talk about the national team, to hear the passion in his voice, leaves you wanting to know more. \u2018I will give myself the best opportunity of getting the job by getting all the badges,\u2019 he added. \u2018I don\u2019t think people should start shouting the odds about the opportunity to manage clubs until they have their badges. I am not sitting here saying \u201cgive me a job\u201d because I don\u2019t have them yet.\u2019 Fitting right in: Ferdinand with David Beckham and Sir Trevor Brooking on the bench in South Africa . He is on the UEFA B licence course and the next step is the A Licence and then the ProLicence. After that, he cannot be ignored. Ferdinand, who turns 36 in November, has too much to offer after a lifetime in the game. He has experienced almost everything. He admires the young coaches; the guys who were given a chance in their thirties. Ferdinand believes they have a better connection with the dressing room. \u2018Low, Klinsmann were young geezers when they started out with Germany,\u2019 he added. \u2018Look at Van Basten, Mourinho, Guardiola and Luis Enrique \u2014 they are not old fellas but they were given a chance. It is different in this country. We are 10 years behind in certain situations. We have to do what\u2019s best for English football.\u2019 Ferdinand has the bug for it. He would be a tracksuit manager, taking England\u2019s players through sessions as they prepare under a player who won 81 caps for his country during a distinguished international career. The old ones aren't always the best: A young Jose Mourinho sprints down the Old Trafford touchline in 2004 . He speaks of radical changes needed with the national set-up, adapting the structure to suit an England team that would be encouraged to play Ferdinand\u2019s way. After 50 years of failure, it has to be worth a shot. \u2018Maybe I\u2019m not their (the FA\u2019s) type, but I don\u2019t know what their type is,\u2019 added Ferdinand. \u2018Maybe it\u2019s an unblemished track record, but everybody deserves a second chance. Glenn Hoddle is a prime example. He\u2019s the best one you had and he is gone, never to be seen again with England. We are on our knees.\u2019 Ferdinand is talking about his eight-month ban from football after he missed a drugs test in 2003. It was an error, a bad one, but he has been the model professional ever since. \u2018Everybody deserves a second chance,\u2019 he says. Ferdinand is right. This is a man who wants to take care of his country, to improve the players and make sure the future of the national team is secure. It has been a long time since anyone could say that. \u2018It will take radical changes for things to happen with England and people\u2019s noses might be put out of joint but in the long run it will work,\u2019 he added. Pepping them up: Pep Guardiola ushered in an era of success at Barcelona after being appointed aged 37 . \u2018I am speaking from a position of wanting to help. When you are a young player, making your way, you don\u2019t want to speak out because you are worried you might not get picked. But when you come out of the firing line, you can speak with experience.\u2019 Ferdinand sat on FA chairman Greg Dyke\u2019s commission, providing some compelling arguments about the state of English football when he sat down to discuss the future of the national team. \u2018Bit left-field that one,\u2019 is his reaction to a question about Roy Hodgson\u2019s claim last week that there isn\u2019t much difference in the way England and Germany try to play. He is reluctant to answer at first, unaware of the comments after he had only just come off QPR\u2019s training pitch in west London as he prepared for the start of the Barclays Premier League season. \u2018I watched the games at the World Cup and I didn\u2019t see any likeness to Germany at all,\u2019 he added. \u2018We see sparks from Sturridge, sparks from Welbeck and from Rooney, but we play as individuals. They will not be able to fulfil their potential unless there is a structure and philosophy to aspire to.\u2019 One day Ferdinand hopes to be able to put it all in place. Lowering the age: World Cup-winning coach Joachim Low was in his thirties when he became Germany boss in 2007, as was his predecessor Jurgen Klinsmann (left) He has the ideas, as well as the experience after playing career that took him to the very top. With his profile, along with his England career, the six Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2008, he will command instant respect in the dressing room. He fears that young players in the Premier League are earning too much, something Brendan Rodgers highlighted last week. \u2018The incentive has gone,\u2019 claimed Ferdinand. \u2018Are you gong to do that extra set of doggies, or sprints? You can be in the reserves and if you have \u00a35,000 a week coming in you\u2019re thinking about what colour car you\u2019re going to get. \u2018Or you might be thinking what holiday you\u2019re going to send your mum and dad on or what shoes you\u2019re going to get. It is a different environment and I don\u2019t think it is the right environment. It is football and if you are given a lot of scope then you will do it. That is the way it is. Maybe clubs or the FA have to revert back a little bit to give them a bit more of a grounding.\u2019 Ferdinand is a traditionalist, one of the old school as he reflects on the days when he would sit on the bench alongside Frank Lampard as a teenager at West Ham. Back then they still cleaned the first-team players\u2019 boots, keeping their head down and driving to training in beaten-up old Ford Fiestas at the start of their careers. The best: Ferdinand rates Glenn Hoddle (left), now QPR first-team coach, as his best England boss . \u2018When I got on the bench at West Ham I thought it was an unbelievable achievement,\u2019 he added. Me and Frank Lampard would sit there thinking, \u201cJesus\u201d. \u2018We would go out there to do the warm up and people think that\u2019s nothing, but it is part of the experience and gets you accustomed to the surroundings. Now those players don\u2019t get the chance. Managers won\u2019t play a 17-year-old when they can play \u201cDavide\u201d or whoever, from wherever, because he has played 300 games and is 28 years old. That\u2019s just my view, but who is right and who is wrong?\u2019 Judging by this, Ferdinand has already got it all figured out.

In three ecstatic messages posted on Twitter, Mr Chavez, 58, thanked Cuban President and ex-leader Raul and Fidel Castro. Chavez had not been seen or heard from since he went to Havana, Cuba on December 10 for treatment, in contrast to previous medical visits. But today his account said: 'We have arrived back in the land of Venezuela. Thank you Lord!! Thanks to my beloved people! We will continue our treatment here.'

In another image, Chavez is seen reading an issue of the Cuban Communist Part newspaper Granma. The pictures were shown on state television by Chavez's son-in-law, Science and Technology Minister Jorge Arreaza alongside new details about Chavez's condition. Government opponent have been demanding to know why Chavez hasn't spoken to the nation to explain his illness. Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said the president had overcome a respiratory infection and is breathing through a tracheal tube that makes it difficult for him to speak. He said: 'After two months of a complicated post-operative process, the patient remains conscious, with his intellectual functions intact, in close communication with his government team.'

The 36-year-old rapper appeared on Kris Jenner's daytime talk show \"Kris\" on Friday to discuss his relationship with Jenner's daughter, Kim Kardashian, and their new addition, North. But if Kanye was smart, he'd hire Jenner as part of his PR team. The reality TV momager, who has extended her family's brand from E! to Fox with this test run of her talk show, reiterated several times that the stone-faced and difficult Kanye portrayed in the media is not the man she's come to know. (Kanye, after all, is now living in her home.) \"I'm so excited that I've gotten to know you like I have,\" Jenner said. \"There are a lot of things that people don't know about you that are so interesting to me that I want other people to hear.\" Kanye spoke about the effect of the birth on his outlook. \"To me it's such a blessing, and I feel like it's going to give me the stability that I need to really create and really do God's work in the way I should,\" Kanye, wearing a \"what would Jesus do\" bracelet, told Jenner. \"Someone to be accountable, someone to be responsible for.

North, who was born June 15, has her mother's eyes and father's cheeks, according to Jenner. \"The thing I think about as a dad is just protection. That's my only goal, to Kanye said his goal is \"to protect my daughter. That's my instinct.\" \"To give my daughter as many opportunities to just be a child. Of course, a big thing that plagues us is this idea of the paparazzi chasing a 5-year-old around and screaming at them. ... You have enough things to deal with and to learn being a new parent and you add that on top of it, and it becomes really intense.\" According to Jenner, Kanye's been into his girlfriend for a long, long time, and would even use Photoshop to draw himself into the yearly Kardashian-Jenner Christmas card. (Seriously -- Jenner showed proof.) Although he couldn't quite remember the first time he met Kardashian, 32, Kanye did know it was love at first sight. \"I'm trying to remember if the first time we met was her being in the studio when she was Brandy's assistant, and I think she brought us in, like, something to drink,\" he said. \"Or it might've been when I was doing Brandy's video and I remember asking my manager, 'Who is that girl right there?' ... I was in love with her before I even got to talk to her.\" Kim, he said, was always someone he dreamed about being with, but more importantly, he feels that they're \"equally yoked.\" \"Being in the limelight, you have to have a match, or someone that's equally yoked,\" he told Jenner. \"It's difficult, because there's people that you would date who would try to date you to maybe be more famous, or people who would want you to be less famous than you were, and just not accept who you are in life. And when I would be on the phone with her, even at my lowest moments, she'd give me energy and remind me of who I was. And I needed that support at all times.\" Kanye knows that there are those who think he and the Kardashian family wouldn't have much in common. But he's trying to grow both spiritually -- \"I'm a Christian,\" he said, \"That's what's important to me, that I grow and walk and raise my family with Christian values.\" \"People feel that me and my girlfriend's mother are of different brands in a way,\" he said. \"But it's not about any of us being at odds, it's about us helping each other and improving each other.

As a creative guy, sometimes it's hard for me to small talk. ...

Not exactly. While there are things he wishes he could change, he also believes that \"everything happened for a reason, and I've grown from it,\" he said. \"I feel that I'm very, very, very blessed, and with that comes great responsibility.

UPDATED: . 16:32 EST, 24 August 2012 . Thriving: Britain's soggy summer has provided perfect breeding conditions for pesky mosquitoes . Beware this Bank Holiday weekend. If the rain doesn\u2019t get you, a mosquito might. Sun-starved Britons who had their hopes of a glorious summer dashed by persistent rain are now dealing with another unpleasant side effect of the bizarre weather - an explosion in the mosquito and flea populations. The . current wet and humid conditions have created a perfect breeding ground . for midges and mozzies and huge numbers of people have already reported . bites. There are even fears of a new 'superflea' evolving - one that is resistant to existing sprays and creams used to tackle the problem. In the past week alone Tesco has seen sales of the creams shoot up by 150 per cent at its pharmacies across the UK, while the number of people calling NHS Direct for advice on treating bites is at its highest level in three years. 'The recent balmy weather has led to the most concentrated demand for insect bite and sting creams we have ever seen,' said Tesco spokeswoman Joy Wickham. 'Demand has been rising through the summer and during the very muggy weather we had last weekend we saw the highest sales so far this year.' The insects won\u2019t be the only\u00a0 hazard, however. As around 1.8million Britons prepare to head abroad for the break, the Met Office is warning of heavy downpours across the country. Some areas could see as much as two inches of rain today. Forecasters issued a 24-hour severe weather alert, predicting torrential storms and gusts of winds of up to 50mph along the south coast. Things could start looking up tomorrow, however. Most of the country is expected to see a drier day with the exception of northern England where there could be some lingering showers. Temperatures are not expected to reach much higher than 20C (68F) over the weekend. Gareth Harvey, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: \u2018It won\u2019t be the best of Bank Holiday weekends. There\u2019s an Atlantic depression heading in towards the UK, bringing spells of quite heavy rain.\u2019 He added: \u2018Monday may start off sunny in some areas, particularly in the East, which will hold on to it for a good part of the day.\u2019 NHS Direct confirmed that this summer has seen the highest number of calls about insect bites and stings for three years. People coping with the humid weather by sleeping with their windows open and spending more time outside are finding themselves plagued by parasites. As people prepare to descend on parks and beer gardens over the bank holiday weekend chemists are ordering in extra supplies of bite remedies to combat the impact of increased numbers of insects eager to sink their 'teeth' into unwitting humans. Entomologist Steven Falk, from the conservation charity Buglife, said the mosquito population had dramatically increased on account of the wet spring and summer - which has created perfect breeding conditions for the pesky flies. 'The wet and humid weather has resulted in an increased breeding habitat for mosquitoes, such as pools and water-filled ditches, which has led to more people being bitten than during a normal year,' he said. Population explosion: Fleas like this one pictured in a dog's fur are also on the increase thanks to the wet and warm weather . And its not just insect remedies for humans that are flying off the shelves - there has also been a 'dramatic' increase in demand for flea treatments for household pets. The UK's flea population has also been thriving in the damp weather conditions, and sales of flea treatments are up 25 per cent year on year, according to BBC Radio 4's consumer programme You and Yours. Ouch: Tesco has reported a 150 per cent increase in demand for insect bite creams in the past week alone at its pharmacies across the UK . Lucy Chadwick, head vet for retailer Pet Drugs Online, said: 'The [sales] numbers do fluctuate a bit from time to time but this is quite dramatic.' Dr Tim Nuttall, veterinary dermatologist at the University of Liverpool, said the flea population has been rising for the past five years but that it has spiked more dramatically in the past two. He explained that the increase in numbers is almost all down to the cat flea, which - despite its title - will live off dogs, ferrets and humans as well as felines. The boom is bad news for those of us susceptible to bites, as experts say that even when fleas appear to be beaten, they can make an unexpected return. Richard Mosely, of the British Pest Control Association, said: 'They have an ability to go into a sort of suspended animation. 'Even if you go into a flat which has been unoccupied for a year, their cocoons can be set off again by the carbon dioxide in people's breath.' Midges and other insects are also on the rise thanks to the washout summer, and NHS Direct has reported an overall rise in the number of calls about all varieties of stings and bites since early May. Calls to the service have doubled since the beginning of July, with the number of queries continuing to rise throughout the month of August. In the period since May, NHS Direct has dealt with 8,953 calls about bites and stings, compared to 8,641 this time last year, and 7,450 for the same period in 2010. Washout: Festivities marking the Queen's Diamond Jubilee were among the events marred by lashing rain this summer. Fans gathered to watch the river pageant are pictured sheltering from the showers . Despite recent warm temperatures, the summer of 2012 is likely to be remembered as one marred by persistent bouts of heavy rain. The pattern is set to continue with forecasters predicting a wet and windy bank holiday this weekend. Intermittent sunny spells are expected to be accompanied by stormy weather conditions that will sweep across the country - threatening to turn the bank holiday weekend into yet another washout.

Then, a so-called \"bike chaser\" jumps out after them. When U.S. troops take control of an airfield in a combat zone, this often is how it begins. Parachutes unfurl. The motorbikes float to earth along with the bike chaser, who quickly cranks one of the motorcycles to life. Soon, the airfield is secured and ready for incoming U.S. aircraft. That's a typical mission for Air Force combat control teams, CCTs for short. And, along with seizing airfields, they help ground force commanders and pilots pinpoint targets in war zones. These kinds of special forces could be useful on the ground in Iraq, military analysts say, in the event of U.S. airstrikes against Islamic extremists. The Navy has its SEALs. The Army has Delta Force. And the Air Force has combat controllers: a lesser known special ops ground force sometimes referred to as \"ground pounders.\" Maj. Charlie Hodges, who served with CCTs in Iraq and Afghanistan, spent a few minutes on the phone with CNN Wednesday to offer an inside perspective on these highly trained, elite squads. \"All of our guys are trained to ride motorcycles,\" says Hodges. Sometimes going to work \"involves jumping out of an airplane, or sliding out a helicopter down a fast rope, or riding some sort of all-terrain vehicle, or going on a mountain path on foot.\" Combat controllers are trained to help fighter pilots hit their targets more accurately without killing innocent civilians or friendly troops. That's a resource that military analysts say would be important now in Iraq's efforts to combat ISIS militants. Iraq's government has asked the United States for airstrikes against ISIS, as it encroaches on the nation's key cities. Limited airstrikes might be possible, analysts say, if U.S. forces were inserted where they could accurately identify targets. For days, military sources have said ISIS fighters are dispersed and mixed with local populations, making them difficult to target precisely with airstrikes. Retired U.S. Marine Gen. John R. Allen, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, told The New York Times this month, \"It's feasible for the U.S. to play a limited role with air power with (special operations forces) combat controllers and limited advisers.\" On Thursday, President Barack Obama announced the United States had \"positioned additional U.S. military assets in the region.\" \"Because of increased intelligence resources,\" he said, the United States is \"developing more information about potential targets associated with (ISIS), and going forward, we will be prepared to take targeted and precise military action if and when we determine that the situation on the ground requires it.\" The President didn't offer any specifics. Related story: Who are the U.S. advisers heading to Iraq? Let's not forget that at the beginning of the Afghanistan war in 2001, ground controllers teamed up with Northern Alliance fighters to help U.S. pilots target and smash the Taliban. It's surprising: In this age of superaccurate smart bombs and camera-enabled, missile-toting drones, Hodges says human targeting intelligence remains the gold standard. \"People think that because they see it in a Jason Bourne movie\" that technology can do everything, Hodges says. \"But I don't think we're ever going to have a totally,100% air-centric war. I think we're always going to need boots on the ground.\" Their job ranks among the most dangerous in the military. Think about it: These guys regularly work near or inside the target zones of some of the most fearsome flying machines devised by man: the A-10 \"warthog,\" the B-2 stealth bomber, the Apache helicopter, the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the AC-130 gunship. 'It can be kind of squirrelly' Falling safely from the air to the ground with all that gear is no small feat. A typical drop comes with two motorcycles. Bike sizes often range from minibikes with 100 cubic centimeter engines to dirt bikes with 250 cubic centimeter engines. The motorcycles are dropped in packages called \"bike bundles.\" Small bikes have parachutes attached to the handlebars. \"It's small enough you can literally pick it up and just throw it out the back of the aircraft,\" says Hodges. \"And that's what they'll do.\" Engines are limited to around 250 cubic centimeters, Hodges says, because the combat controllers are riding with 100 pounds of gear on their backs. \"When you have your center of gravity that high, it can be kind of squirrelly,\" he says. \"So we do a fair amount of training,\" starting with a certified Motorcycle Safety Foundation course followed by intensive experience with various four-wheeled all-terrain vehicles and side-by-sides. Bike chasers retrieve and mount the motorcycles and use them to quickly secure the air field runways and clear them of obstacles. \"Hopefully the bike's got an electric start \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and not just a kickstarter,\" Hodges says. If the bike takes a tumble when it lands, that could temporarily mess up its fuel system, he says, making it troublesome to fire up with a kickstarter. In addition to helping ID air targets, these troops also work to protect civilians and allied forces on the ground. \"If they're being fired on by the enemy, we can bring in aircraft,\" Hodges says. Controllers also have access to special airborne surveillance assets that give them \"eyes in the sky\" for U.S. ground troops who need to know \"what's on the other side of that building,\" as Hodges put it. \"When you're pinned down and can't move, having eyes in the sky to take out the enemy is pretty instrumental in making sure your guys come back alive.\" Air control for earthquake victims . Attached to the Air Force 24th Special Operations Wing at Hurlburt Field, Florida, these guys are FAA certified air traffic controllers. In 2010, the CCTs deployed to Haiti, responding to a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that left more than 230,000 people dead. At the airport in Port-au-Prince, \"nobody was sure of the structural integrity of the tower,\" says Hodges. \"So they set up in the infield and they landed 200 planes a day \u00e2\u20ac\u201d all with notebook paper, a card table and handheld radios.\" Two-hundred planes a day rivals air traffic at some of the world's busiest airports, including Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson. The camaraderie you might expect between pilots and combat controllers is strong, Hodges says. \"It's always neat when you've worked with a guy here in the States and then go overseas and they call up and you recognize their call sign.\" There's also some professional, good-natured rivalry. \"We remind them that they're flying around in their air-conditioned cockpits,\" he says. \"We're on the ground in the heat and humidity, carrying 100 pounds on our backs.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maj.

Hodges emphasized the irreplaceable value of human targeting intelligence despite technological advances."}]}

According to industry consulting firm Screen Engine, 17 percent of moviegoers are still reluctant to head to the theater following the shooting. While that number has dropped from the 21 percent who claimed they were reluctant one week after the shooting, it's still telling \u2014 and discouraging \u2014 for Hollywood. Fortunately, moviegoers have a lot of options to choose from. When the top seven movies at the box office all earn over $10 million, it's clear that the box office isn't in totally dire straits, but it doesn't seem to be firing on all cylinders. Sylvester Stallone and his weathered crew of grizzly action stars (and fresh-faced Liam Hemsworth) pushed their explosive sequel \"The Expendables 2\" to a $28.8 million debut, 17 percent lower than the $34.8 million bow of 2010\u2032s original \"Expendables.\" The number one debut marks the first time pop culture icon Chuck Norris has ever topped the box office. There really is nothing he can't do. Lionsgate spent $35 million to acquire the film, which was made by Nu Image for a reported $90 million. Audiences, which were 63 percent male and 65 percent above the age of 25 (both older and more male despite the addition of Hemsworth), issued the film a healthy \"A-\" CinemaScore grade. The explosive action entry also earned markedly better reviews than its predecessor, which could spur positive word-of-mouth, which Expendables 2 will need in order to match the original's $103.1 million domestic finish and for Stallone to justify another sequel. \"The Bourne Legacy\" held second place after dropping 55 percent to $17 million. Universal's $125 million sequel, which replaced star Matt Damon with \"The Avengers'\" Jeremy Renner, has now earned $69.6 million after ten days. By comparison, \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" earned $69.3 million during its opening weekend in 2007. Focus Features' \"ParaNorman\" kicked off its run in third place with $14 million \u2014 a touch behind the $16.8 million that Coraline, which was also made by Laika Entertainment, earned in its debut. The 3-D flick, about a boy who can communicate with the dead, launched very wide in 3,429 theaters, and it achieved a rather lackluster $4,085 venue average \u2014 the least of any of the newcomers, including \"The Odd Life of Timothy Green,\" which found about $4,199 at each of its 2,598 theaters. Audiences gave \"ParaNorman\" a \"B+\" CinemaScore grade, which, again, was the lowest of any of the new releases, despite the fact that it earned the strongest critical reviews by far. \"ParaNorman\" will need some incredible holds in order to match Coraline's $75.3 million finish, but that film benefited from being part of the 3-D craze that peaked in 2009. \"ParaNorman\" is entering a very different marketplace where 3-D affection has long since passed. In fourth, Will Ferrell and Zack Galifinakis' comedy \"The Campaign\" dipped 50 percent to $13.4 million, which lifted the R-rated hit's total to $51.7 million. While \"The Campaign\" will likely miss the $100 million mark, it cost Warner Bros. only $30 million to make, and it should prove a profitable venture for the studio. The allure of Whitney Houston's final performance didn't drive many crowds to Sparkle, which began in fifth place with $12 million. As a point of comparison, the concert doc Michael Jackson: \"This Is It\" -- which arrived four months after Michael Jackson's death \u2014 started off hotter than \"Sparkle,\" earning $23.2 million in its opening weekend in October 2009 on the way to a $72.1 million finish. Sparkle didn't have 3-D ticket prices working on its side, but still, its less-than-stellar box office is somewhat surprising given Houston's status as pop royalty. Fortunately, the ScreenGems release cost only $14 million, and that low cost will be its saving grace. Thanks to a narrow theater count of 2,244, \"Sparkle\" notched a sturdy, if uninspiring, $5,348 per theater average, and if it can garner strong word-of-mouth \u2014 which seems likely given its \"A\" CinemaScore grade \u2014 it could find legs in the weeks to come. \"Sparkle's\" leading lady Jordin Sparks, who won Season 6 of \"American Idol,\" isn't the first Idol champ to show up at the box office, though she did garner the strongest opening weekend results. Season 4 winner Carrie Underwood had a supporting role in 2011\u2032s \"Soul Surfer,\" which opened to $10.6 million on the way to a $43.9 million finish. Season 1 winner Kelly Clarkson led the famously awful musical \"From Justin To Kelly,\" which earned $4.9 million total in 2003. Now, if only Sparks could match their album sales. As reported yesterday, sixth place finisher \"The Dark Knight Rises,\" which grossed $11.1 million (down 41 percent) in its fifth weekend, passed the $400 million milestone. It has now earned $409.9 million total, and has passed \"The Hunger Games\" ($407.7 million) as the 12th highest-grossing domestic performer of all time. The final new release of the weekend, \"The Odd Life of Timothy Green,\" started back in seventh place with $10.9 million. Disney's $25 million family drama, which stars Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Garner, earned $4.3 million on Wednesday and Thursday, which gives it an unremarkable five-day total of $15.2 million. \"Odd Life,\" which was issued an \"A-\" CinemaScore grade, will have to rely on (leafy) legs to drive its business. Garner has had bad luck at the box office ever since her breakout leading role in 2004\u2032s \"13 Going on 30.\" She has a few bright spots on her resume \u2014 namely the ensemble comedy \"Valentine's Day,\" which earned $110.5 million, and, to a lesser extent, the Matthew McConaughey rom-com \"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,\" which grossed $55.3 million \u2014 but she's mostly starred in major misfires like Elektra ($24.4 million total), Catch and Release ($15.5 million), The Invention of Lying ($18.5 million), and Arthur ($33 million). Bubbling under the Top 10 at number 13, the anti-Obama documentary 2016 Obama's America expanded from 61 theaters into 169 locations, and increased its gross by 294 percent to $1.25 million. Tellingly, the film's per theater average increased from $5,202 to $7,391 this weekend, a rare feat at the box office \u2014 but especially when a film's theater count nearly triples. 2016 Obama's America has grossed $2.1 million in six weeks, and if it maintains this sort of momentum, it could become a major sleeper hit.

A British artist has been killed and his partner is feared dead after a gas explosion ripped through the home they built together in Portugal. Glyn Uzzell, 84, had lived with Paul Fonk in the villa in the Algarve region for 35 years, and two works by David Hockney were thought to be hanging in his home when it was destroyed. Portuguese media reported tonight that Mr Uzzell's partner had been confirmed as a second victim in the tragic blast. Tragic: Glyn Uzzell (left) built the house himself with his partner Paul Fonk (right) in southern Portugal. It exploded in what is thought to have been an accidental gas blast yesterday which sent debris flying 300m away . Wreckage: The home was completely destroyed along with a separate studio for Mr Uzzell's work . The vast explosion yesterday morning was heard more than a mile away and completely obliterated the house, leaving its roof on a neighbour's property. Debris was thrown 300 metres away before police and rescue workers descended on the area, popular with British ex-pats, just before 8am local time. Destroyed: A print of The Diploma by David Hockney (pictured) was believed to be in Mr Uzzell's home . Born in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 1930, Mr Uzzell studied at London's renowned Goldsmith\u2019s College before moving in 1957 to teach at the International School of Geneva, Switzerland. There he won prizes and was given a one-man exhibition at the city's Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Athen\u00e9e. It was there that he met his Luxembourg-born partner Mr Fonk and the pair moved to the Portuguese village of Caramujeira, near Lisbon, in 1979. They painstakingly renovated a dilapidated farmhouse into a villa and decorated it with art, including two works by the renowned British artist David Hockney. One of the works was believed to be a tongue-in-cheek etching of a fake diploma which Hockney made when the Royal College of Art refused to award him one after he spoiled an exam paper as a protest. Friend Rolf Osang said Mr Uzzell picked up . the artwork in a gallery in London's . Sloane Square for a little over \u00a35 soon after it was created in 1962. Called The Diploma, it was produced in an edition of 50 and has been hailed as one of Hockney's great early works. Another copy of The Diploma sold at auction for \u00a329,760 last year in London. Mr Uzzell's print, which featured a goose-stepping art school head and a monster, is thought to have been destroyed in the blast. Mr Osang, 64, who owns the Galeria Arte Algarve where Mr Uzzell exhibited much of his recent work, paid tribute to the artist. 'He's a very established artist and we . were very lucky to have him,' Mr Osang told MailOnline. Nothing left: Neighbours said they heard the blast more than a mile away and it sounded like an earthquake . Emergency response: Firefighters and paramedics attended the scene in the village of Caramujeira . 'He had been . very ill with heart problems and hadn't been exhibiting for five years, . but started again after he had a heart operation and had an implant put . in. 'He was an incredibly . warm person and a loving person and of course, such a loving person was . much loved by those who knew him too. Well-loved: Mr Uzzell was born in Swindon, Wiltshire and studied at Goldsmith's in London . 'He had the most wonderful house. He built it all himself with his partner and they had two pieces by David Hockney in the house, as well as a separate studio with his own works which I believe have been destroyed. 'He came often to the gallery and was very sociable. 'He was such a happy person and he came to the gallery only last Friday, completely jubilant about life and his recovering health. 'It's hit me and others in the art community here terribly. 'People felt the blast a mile and a half away. We have many small earthquakes here and it felt like one of those.' In a biography on his website, the artist wrote: 'My work is greatly influenced by the environment. 'Subjects are alluded to but not with straightforward representation. 'Time, place and mood play their part in images that are ostensibly abstract but reveal a point of contact with the visual world.' Mr Uzzell is believed to have a sister from Britain who visited him in Portugal earlier this year. A Foreign Office spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Lagoa, Algarve. We stand ready to provide consular assistance.'

Brutal Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's forces are murdering civilians in organised attacks on towns and villages that amount to crimes against humanity, Amnesty International said today. The rights group has now repeated its call for the United Nations Security Council to refer Syria to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and to impose an arms embargo. Amnesty's findings, detailed in a 70-page report, add to reports of massacres elsewhere in Syria as the 15-month-old uprising against President Bashar Assad was declared a civil war. It comes as a booby-trapped car exploded in a Damascus suburb this morning, wounding at least two people. Blast: A car bomb exploded in Damascus today as Amnesty International accused Syrian dictator Bashar Assad of crimes against humanity . Aftermath: The bomb exploded in a suburb home to a popular Shiite Muslim shrine, wounding at least two . Devastation: Damaged shops at the site of a car bomb in the Sayyida Zeinab suburb of Damascus this morning . Researchers visited 23 towns and villages in the Aleppo and Idlib provinces between April and May. They conducted interviews with more than 200 people, including many whose relatives had been killed or whose homes had been destroyed. Amnesty adviser Donatella Rovera said she had found repeated examples of brutality against civilians during two months of unauthorised visits to northwest Syria. She said: 'Wherever I went, in every town, in every village, there was a very similar pattern. 'Soldiers who went in, in very large numbers, for very short but very brutal incursions where they extra-judicially executed young men, burned down their homes. 'Those who they arrested were then tortured in detention. And that was really repeated in every town and every village that I visited. Fighters: Free Syrian Army members, with covered faces and holding weapons, sit by the side of a street in the Qaboun district of Damascus . Plea: France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius (left) wants the UN to make Kofi Annan's (right) peace plan obligatory . 'The bulk, the overwhelming majority of the violations are being committed by the government security forces and their paramilitary militia against the civilian population.' A peace plan brokered by former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan has failed to end bloodshed that has cost the lives of more than 10,000 people. Syria's government says it is not cracking down on activists, but fighting foreign-backed 'terrorists' it blames for killing hundreds of soldiers and police. Witnesses quoted in the Amnesty report said most of those killed had nothing to do with the resistance to Assad's rule. A resident of Saraqeb in Idlib . province described how soldiers had carried out door-to-door searches, . killing people as they fled or in their homes. Conflict continues: An image grab taken from a video uploaded on YouTube on Monday shows smoke billowing from the flashpoint Syrian city of Homs which activists said was being attacked by regime forces . Demanding change: Demonstrators in Kafranbel, near Idlib hold a placard (left) that reads: 'Are you dumb? Is there any sane person who really believes there could be a peaceful solution?' He said: 'The army seemed to consider all the men in these towns, especially young men but not only, as terrorists. 'Most of those executed in this way . were not fighters, just ordinary people. Some were killed just because . the army could not find their wanted relatives.' Amnesty . said the report provided 'further evidence that deliberate and unlawful . killings are part of a widespread and systematic attack against the . civilian population'. A Labour town councillor who tweeted for the conflict in Syria to end claims his website has been hacked by supporters of dictator Bashar Assad's regime. A group calling itself Syria Storm has taken over the site detailing cllr Ben Hart's work for Lydd Town Council in Kent. Mr Hart, 23, said he was amazed someone thought his views were important enough to merit a personal attack. He said: 'I just don't understand it. I've spoken about Syria on Twitter, but mentioned nothing on my own website. 'I am not intimidated by the attack and it has given me the chance to go back and redesign it as I was intending to do anyway.' The homepage was left with a black background, a picture of the brutal Syrian leader, and the message it had been 'HaCk3d By Syrian Storm'. It was 'carried out in an organised manner and as part of state policy, and therefore amount to crimes against humanity'. Yesterday France called for the UN to enforce envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan for Syria - in a move which could see force used against Assad's regime. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said he was hoping that Russia, a key ally of Syria, would agree to invoking the UN's Chapter 7 to make it happen. It allows the use of military force. The first stage could be to impose a No Fly Zone and allow humanitarian aid into the country. But, as seen in other conflicts, it could escalate to more drastic action if the regime doesn't bend to international demands. And echoing UN peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous's comments the day before, he said the Syrian conflict was now a 'civil war'. He said: 'We propose making the implementation of the Annan plan compulsory. 'We need to pass to the next speed at the Security Council and place the Annan plan under Chapter 7 - that is to say make it compulsory under pain of very heavy sanctions.' France would propose toughening sanctions on Syria at the next meeting of EU foreign ministers, he added. And the international community would prepare a list of second-ranking military officials who would be pursued by international justice, alongside President Bashar Assad and his immediate entourage. He said: 'They must understand that the only future is in resisting oppression. The time for taking a decision has arrived. They have to jump ship.' International attention: UN observers view bodies at a hospital morgue before the burial of the Houla dead . Outrage: Mourners attend a mass burial in Syria for more than 100 people, half of whom were children, killed in a massacre in the city of Houla last month . The chaos continued today as a car bomb exploded in a Damascus suburb home to a popular Shiite Muslim shrine, wounding at least two people. Activists said regime troops were also continuing to shell rebellious areas in central Homs province. It was not immediately clear what the target of Thursday's blast in Sayyida Zainab was. State news said the car bomb detonated in a parking lot near the Imam Sadr Hospital, causing substantial material damage. Car bombs and suicide bombings have become common in Syria as the 15-month uprising against President Bashar Assad has become increasingly militarised with both sides of the conflict now using more powerful weapons. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three civilians were killed overnight in clashes at the entrances of the Jouret el-Shayyah neighborhood in Homs city. Another died in the rebel-held town of Rastan north of Homs, which has been under constant and intense fire from regime forces for days. Syrian forces yesterday overran a mountain enclave near the Mediterranean coast, seizing the territory back from rebels after battles that raged for eight days. State television said regime forces had 'cleansed' Haffa of 'armed terrorist groups' and the Foreign Ministry urged UN observers to immediately head there 'to check what the terrorist groups have done'. UN observers did not go to Haffa yesterday though and are assessing the situation to determine when they can successfully reach the town, UN peacekeeping spokesman Kieran Dwyer said. On Tuesday, an angry crowd hurled rocks and sticks at the UN mission's vehicles, forcing them to turn back. None of the observers was hurt. Sausan Ghosheh, a spokeswoman for the observers, said they have been trying to reach Haffa since June 7."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Amnesty's report accuses Assad's forces of crimes against humanity in Syria's civil war, amidst a car bomb explosion in Damascus.

In one recording he says: 'There's . probably a million people who say they're Jesus and most of them are in . asylums. 'But one of us has to be. How do I know I am?

He explains on his Divine Truth website that he and 'other . Celestial Angels' tried to convey divine truth to an American man named James . Padgett between 1914-23 in New York. However, 'unfortunately, no-one really fully understood the message . that was given.' So Mr Miller and Mary Magdalene .

Royal Mail will increase the price of second class stamps by 50 per cent if it gets the go-ahead. The State-owned company wants the cost of the stamps to rise from the current 36p to at least 50p. Regulator Ofcom has been carrying out a consultation aimed at giving greater commercial freedom to Royal Mail, including handing the firm the power to set the price of first class stamps. Sky high: Royal Mail have demanded the right to charge people as much as they want to send a letter . It is proposing a cap on second class . stamps of between 45p and 55p, but Royal Mail has confirmed it wants . them to be at the upper end of the scale. Ofcom said its proposals, announced . in October, were aimed at protecting the universal service obligation . (USO) under which the Royal Mail has to deliver to any address in the UK . for the same price, six days a week. It has been under pressure in recent . years because of falling mail volumes, which has seen the number of . letters delivered every day slump by 22 million to 62 million between . 2006 and 2010, contributing towards a loss of \u00a3120million last year. Consumers have also switched from . first to second class mail - now posted in equal numbers - while stamp . prices have lagged behind inflation for almost 20 years. Soaring: The price of a first class stamp has risen from 27p in 2000 to 46p today . The price of a first class stamp in . the UK is among the lowest in Europe at 46p, compared with 69p in Italy, . 67p in Denmark and 60p in Greece, while service targets are among the . highest, Ofcom pointed out.

In . a decision which will trigger outrage among its customers, the . State-owned company wrote to Britain\u2019s postal regulator insisting . all the current price caps, should be scrapped. The . letter, seen by the Daily Mail, states clearly: \u2018Royal Mail does not . believe that the case is strong for the imposition of a price cap on any . of our products.\u2019 The letter states that, if Ofcom insists . on a price cap, that it \u2018should be set at the upper end of Ofcom\u2019s . proposed range (ie 55p.)\u2019 It went on to say that it believes there is . \u2018no affordability concern\u2019 for Britain\u2019s cash-strapped households.

It is still a tropical storm, as it drifts farther away from the state. Hurricane Julio should pass by over the weekend and is expected to track north of Hawaii, according to current predictions, sparing the state. But the weather service advised the public to remain diligent, as weather conditions and the forecast could change. Iselle's top winds weakened to 60 mph as it made landfall at 2:30 a.m. Friday along the Kau coast of the Big Island. Had the storm remained a hurricane, it would have been the first to hit Hawaii in decades. By Friday night, the National Weather Service canceled the tropical storm warnings for Maui County and Oahu. Kauai, however, remained under a tropical storm warning. A warning for Hawaii County was canceled earlier. A flash flood watch remained in place for the state through 6 a.m. Saturday. Iselle was still producing locally damaging wind gusts over the smaller islands, the statement said. The state's primary election was expected to take place Saturday despite the storm. Abercrombie, who has taken advantage of the storm to show leadership and appear on television, is in a tough race against State Sen. David Ige in the Democratic primary. U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz faces a challenge from U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa. Schatz was appointed to the seat after the death of longtime Sen. Daniel Inouye. Heavy rains were the biggest threat, with general rainfall predicted to be between 4 and 8 inches, although some areas could get more than a foot. Flash flood warnings cover much of the Big Island, while flash flood watches have been issued for the entire state. Iselle has already delivered 11 inches of rain on the Big Island, according to Mike Cantin with the National Weather Service. In a conference call, Cantin said the Big Island should expect more than a foot of rain. Doug Mayne, of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency, said heavy rains have prevented the agency from beginning to assess the impact of the storm. Conditions made it unsafe to get helicopters in the air to access the hardest-hit areas. Hawaii Electric Light said in a tweet that nearly 22,000 customers were without power in various parts of the Big Island. As the storm approached, supermarket shelves were swept bare, while schools and government offices closed. Sandbags were placed around homes and hotels, and ports told to close. In Hawaii County, 630 people have gone to shelters, Mayor Billy Kenoi told CNN affiliate KHON-TV in Honolulu. Track the storm . The state had prepared for a potentially devastating one-two tropical cyclone punch, starting with Iselle and followed by Hurricane Julio, a Category 3 storm, about 900 miles behind it. Hurricane Julio could affect the islands over the weekend, though forecasters expect it to brush the state only with its southern outer bands as it passes to the north as a weakened tropical storm. Julio had strengthened to a Category 3 storm with top winds of 120 mph by Friday morning, when it was centered less than 1,000 miles away. A relatively rare event . Direct hits are rare for the state. Since the 1950s, two hurricane eyes have hit Hawaii -- and both approached from the south, where water temperature generally is warm enough to sustain the storms' strength. That's not to say Hawaii hasn't had close calls. The central Pacific sees an average of about five tropical cyclones a year, and some have brushed the state in recent decades. The cyclones generally approach from the east after forming in the eastern Pacific. But close to Hawaii, dry air, cooler water and wind shear combine to weaken approaching cyclones, dissipating them before they can become a significant threat, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. Hawaii's most damaging hurricane in recent decades -- Hurricane Iniki of 1992 -- came during an El Nino year, or a year of above-average sea surface temperatures. This year hasn't met the criteria for El Nino, but it could in the weeks ahead, Petersons said. Iniki killed at least four people and caused about $2 billion in damage when it hit the western Hawaiian island of Kauai, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. School's out; air travel disrupted . The schools on the Big Island and Maui were closed Friday as residents assessed Iselle's impact. Some airlines made concessions to customers. Hawaiian Airlines moved one flight, to Los Angeles, up by five hours to beat Iselle's arrival. For people who had been scheduled to travel to or from Hawai's airports on Thursday and Friday, United Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines said they won't charge fees to change reservations, and they'll waive differences in fares for those changes. United canceled flights to Hilo and Kona. American Airlines and US Airways also called off flights out of Kona on Thursday but expected Friday's flight schedule to operate normally. Island Air will do the same for passengers ticketed from Thursday though Tuesday. Delta Air Lines said it would waive fees for reservation changes for Thursday and Friday, but fare increases could apply. It said two flights had been delayed in leaving the islands.

Homeowner Michael Dupre said they heard the sinkhole open up in their backyard around 5:15 this morning. 'It sounded like banging against the windows.

Fire and rescue officials told them to grab whatever they could and get out of the home. Sinkhole alley: Sinkholes are common in this area of Florida, nicknamed 'sinkhole alley' for the type of porous rocks that cause the earth to shift . 'We grabbed only the important stuff. Insurance information - stuff like that,' Mr Dupre said. 'You don't really think about this kind of stuff happening.' Sinkholes are common in Florida because the peninsula is made up of porous carbonate rocks such as limestone that store and help move water underground. Over time, the rocks can dissolve from an acid created from oxygen in water, creating a void under the limestone roof. When dirt, clay or sand gets too heavy for the limestone roof, it can collapse, creating a sinkhole. On February 28, Jeffrey Bush died when a sinkhole opened under his bedroom in Seffner, Florida, near Tampa. His body was never recovered. In August, sections of a building at a resort near Orlando collapsed into a sinkhole. No one was injured in that sinkhole.

A $550 million jackpot would be the second largest in Powerball history and the third largest for any lottery. Lottery officials expect jackpot totals of this size to continue to climb in shorter amounts of time, thanks in part to a game redesign in January 2012 that increased the odds of winning some kind of prize, but also lowered the possible number combinations to win the Powerball.

Kristen Diane Parker, who worked at Rose Medical Center in Denver, has admitted to secretly injecting herself in a bathroom and using unclean syringes as replacements for patients, investigators said.

That explains why baby Jasleen, born in Germany last week, weighed more than 13 pounds. Her mother had gestational diabetes, but her condition wasn't discovered until she went into labor and checked herself into University Hospital Leipzig. Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy and resembles other forms of diabetes in that it affects how your cells use sugar (glucose). With gestational diabetes, a mother's blood sugar should return to normal soon after delivery. However, the condition puts women at risk for type 2 diabetes in the future. For every 100 pregnant women in the U.S, two to 10 will have gestational diabetes, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention says. A woman who has gestational diabetes during pregnancy and maintains a high blood-sugar level may have a baby born abnormally large, weighing 9 pounds or more, the CDC says. A baby's large size creates problems for the delivery of the child through the birth canal and may cause nerve damage in the child's shoulder during birth. \"A very large baby has an increased chance of being overweight or obese later in life,\" the CDC says. \"Being overweight or obese increases the chance of also having diabetes later in life.\" Gestational diabetes results from hormonal changes that every woman has during pregnancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Elevated levels of certain hormones made in the placenta disrupt insulin's ability to manage glucose, a condition called insulin resistance. (The placenta is the organ connecting the baby by the umbilical cord to the uterus and sends nutrients from mother to child.) As the placenta becomes larger throughout pregnancy, it creates more hormones, which, in turn, increases the insulin resistance, the Cleveland Clinic said. The mother's pancreas is typically able to make three times the normal amount of insulin to beat this resistance, according to the Cleveland Clinic. If the pancreas can't produce the required amount of insulin, however, sugar levels will rise, and the woman will have gestational diabetes. You may be at risk for gestational diabetes if you are overweight before becoming pregnant, have a family history of diabetes, are older than 25, have previously giving birth to a baby over 9 pounds, previously gave birth to a stillborn baby, have had gestational diabetes with a previous pregnancy or have been diagnosed with pre-diabetes, the Cleveland Clinic said. Women typically find out whether they have gestational diabetes between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic. That's when insulin resistance usually begins. If you previously had gestational diabetes or if your doctor is concerned about your risk of developing it, you can be tested for the condition before the 13th week of pregnancy, according to the Cleveland Clinic. An oral glucose tolerance test is used to screen for gestational diabetes. This involves consuming 50 grams of glucose in a beverage. Your body will absorb the glucose and cause your blood sugar levels to rise within 30 to 60 minutes, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Blood samples are taken from a vein in your arm 30 minutes after consuming the sweetened drink so that your doctor can evaluate how your body processes glucose. According to the Mayo Clinic, expectant mothers can control gestational diabetes by eating healthy foods, exercising and, if required, taking medication. Treatment may include monitoring blood sugar four to five times a day, which involves drawing a drop of blood from your finger and testing it with a blood glucose meter. Your health care providers will monitor and manage your blood sugar levels during labor and delivery. Following up with blood sugar checks after the baby is born is also important. You can reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes later on by continuing to eat a healthy diet and getting regular exercise.

Butler, the star of Hollywood blockbusters including 300 and PS I Love You, attracted almost as much attention as his fellow countryman Andy Murray's efforts on court yesterday, as he and fellow film star Bradley Cooper brought a dash of A-list glamour to the box in co-ordinating summery blue suits and shades.

Also looking on were Maria Miller, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, and her husband Iain, and Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards, while acclaimed classical pianist Mitsuko Uchido, wearing a quirky pair of glasses, appeared deep in conversation with the Duke of Kent in the front row. There were jubilant scenes in the Royal Box as Andy Murray sealed his much longed-for victory to take the title, but not everybody in the section was entirely thrilled with the result.

Representatives of prominent media organisations, supporters of British tennis are also among those lucky enough to make the cut. Invitations come from the Chairman of the All England Club, and take into account suggestions from members of The Championships' Organising Committee and the Lawn Tennis Assocation along with other relevant partners. The jovial atmosphere evident in the Royal Box yesterday will have continued after Murray raised the trophy, as guests are invited to the Clubhouse for lunch, tea and drinks at the end of the day. Prime Minister David Cameron's suit and tie provoked a lot of reaction on Twitter given the soaring temperatures, but he was merely following protocol, as male guests in the Royal Box are asked to wear smart dress such as a suit or jacket and tie.

Britain\u2019s failure means a poor child born in 1970 is less likely to have gone to university than one born in 1958, the MPs say. The report makes it clear the differences become ingrained as young as the age of three. Studies have shown that while only 42 per cent of parents in the poorest fifth of homes read to their children every day, 78 per cent of those in the richest fifth do so. Wealthier parents are also more likely to send their children to bed at a regular time. It has led to richer children being more likely to be deemed \u2018ready\u2019 for school at three. Better future: The prospects of poorer children born in Denmark (above) and Australia (below) are much brighter . They also perform much better in vocabulary tests at five. Children from poorer households are more likely to be hyperactive. The MPs called on the Government to consider ways of improving the education of those from poor backgrounds, such as means-testing fees at independent schools to get more poor people into top schools and sending more poor children to summer camps. But it failed to mention either the return of grammar schools or the assisted-places scheme for poorer families, which was abolished by the last Labour government. The MPs\u2019 report concluded that the biggest impact on social mobility was the quality of parenting, whether the home environment was educational and whether the parents had good mental health. It says: \u2018A child\u2019s development from zero to three is the point of greatest leverage for social mobility. It is acknowledged that this is difficult territory for policy makers as it relates to parenting as well as what happens in childcare and nursery settings.\u2019 The conclusion will be controversial because it could be used to support greater \u2018nanny state\u2019 interference into families. The MPs urged ministers to do more to encourage parents to read to children using techniques similar to the \u2018five-a-day\u2019 campaign which encourages people to eat more fruit and veg. The study also found that the gap between rich and poor on university access has widened. In 1981, children from the richest fifth of households were three times more likely than those from the poorest fifth to go to university.

The six-year-old girl and boy, seven, had gone by the time they got back to the flat - having been collected by the police after a neighbour called at 5.40am to say the children were home alone. Avoided jail: The pair, aged 25 and 26, drank heavily at the older mother\u2019s home in Gloucester before heading out to the pub at about 11pm and going onto a party where they stayed until 11am the next day . Officers found that the flat was cold, there was very little food in the kitchen and the only bedding was a thin and dirty duvet with no pillow, Gloucester Crown Court was told. The two mothers pleaded guilty to child neglect and were both sentenced to six months in jail suspended for two years, as well as a supervision order, offender programme and overnight curfew. Judge Euan Ambrose told the pair - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - he only spared them jail to avoid their children suffering further. The judge said: \u2018Your decision to go out was utterly irresponsible. It amounted to the two of you putting your own selfish pleasures above the welfare of your children.\u2019 Both children were taken into care after the offence but the boy - the son of the older woman - had been returned to her after four weeks.

The police therefore opened the door and the little girl was crying. \u2018She said she didn\u2019t have anything to wear on her bottom half of her body so the police looked in the boy\u2019s bedroom to see if they could find anything suitable for her to put on. \u2018In his bedroom they noticed what is described as his bedding being a thin dirty duvet with no pillow.

But some experiences around the world are more extreme than others, even putting holidaymakers at risk of arrest. From Bolivia's so-called Death Road - a mountain-side route that tourists tackle on bikes - to the experience of being 'arrested' by Soviet secret police in Lithuania, here are some of the most extreme tours that holidaymakers pay for around the world. Memories of the horrific nuclear blast remain for tourists to see on the Fukushima tour . Contamination levels are now low enough for coach tours to visit the Fukushima power plant . The Fukushima Nuclear Reactor Tour - Japan . The Fukushima site, the scene of the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl, has become a tourist attraction. Local government tour guides are now escorting buses of people through the area, explaining what has become of the disaster zone. Back in 2011, three of the Fukushima Nuclear Plant's six reactors blew up following a tsunami, releasing radioactive gases that meant the whole area had to be evacuated. However, with contamination levels said to be 'low', people are being permitted on whistle-stop tours to view the desolate and abandoned place. Tourists who visit Lithuania get the chance to experience the terrors of a Soviet bunker . Holidaymakers must sign a waiver before agreeing to sign up for the Soviet Bunker Tour . The Soviet Bunker Experience - Lithuania . Lithuania offers a chance for holidaymakers to experience what life was like under the control of the USSR - using real dogs and former KGB officers, and taking place in a former Soviet bunker. The terrifying experience starts with visitors being 'ambushed' by the Red Army in the middle of the forest, 15 miles from the capital Vilnius, before being transported down into the bunker for a three-hour Soviet experience. Before taking part in the experience, which is called 1984: The Survival Drama, holidaymakers are asked to sign a waiver, which includes a clause stating: 'In case of disobedience participants may receive psychological or physical punishments.' Mexicans are led to the border with the US all for show in the Illegal Border Crossing Experience . The Illegal Border Crossing Experience - Mexico . A small town in Mexico has set up a quasi-theme park that offers visitors the chance to experience what Mexican immigrants go through when they illegally cross the U.S. border. For approximately $20 (\u00a313), tourists visiting El Alberto can spend their Saturday night getting a three-hour simulated experience of what it is like to be a migrant attempting to cross the border. Participants in the Caminata Nocturna, which translates as 'night walk', go on a challenging trek where they must evade 'immigration officials' and 'border patrol agents' as they flee through rough terrain. Of course, unlike the millions of migrants who illegally cross into the U.S, the tourists\u2019 lives are in no real danger. A worst case scenario here would be a nasty fall. Make Your Own Cocaine Tour - Colombia . The South American country has cocaine 'factory' tours high up in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada. Holidaymakers willing to take extreme risks can work with local guides to visit poverty-stricken farmers who gamble with their lives in a desperate bid to provide for their families. Tours of the illegal farms can cost as little as $9 (\u00a36), but tourists put themselves at risk from paramilitaries operating in the area - who have been known to kidnap foreigners and hold them years at a time - or arrest by local police. Both experiences are highly illegal and even seeking them out can put foreign travellers at risk of arrest or attack by drug traffickers or paramilitaries. Those who take part in the underground tours can be arrested even if they are just caught on the property of the drug-makers. Many people like taking on a bungee jump, but would you fancy doing one over a crocodile-infested river? Bungee Jumping Over Crocodile-infested Waters - Zambia/Zimbabwe border . Tourists can leap head first from the Victoria Bridge over the crocodile-infested Zambezi River. However, back in 2012, then 22-year-old Australian Erin Langworth took on the bungee challenge, with almost fatal consequences. After flying off the bridge, her rope snapped and she plunged into the water, feet still bound. Her rope got caught on rocks, but that was the least of her trouble with crocodiles swarming. Miraculously, she managed to untangle the rope, and swim to safety with just cuts, bruises and a broken collarbone. Tourists get the chance to explore the Bolivian mines of Potosi, with dynamite strapped to their backs . Mining With Dynamite - Bolivia . In the Silver Mines of Potosi, Bolivia, you can crawl around in the gravel with dynamite strapped to your back. Not only that, but you are handed 95 per cent proof alcohol to give you the Dutch courage to continue on your quest. But once you've polished off the tipple, be prepared to put your mask on, as the dynamite show begins - the walls of the mines shake and disintegrate around you. Not one for the faint-hearted. Silver Lining Tours allow visitors to get up close and personal to Tornados in America's Midwest . Tornado Tours - America's Midwest . Silver Lining Tours will take guests to within a quarter of a mile of some of the swirling 300mph vertical wind funnels. Storm-chasers Roger and Caryn Hill are now taking British punters on the hunt of their lives following deadly and destructive tornados. Ploughing their way through 'Tornado Alley', the couple drive groups of up to 18 people in three buses and charge up to \u00a3230 a day for a ten-day chase. At 15,400ft, The Death Road in Bolivia is a favourite spot for thrill-seeking cyclists . The Death Road Tour - Bolivia . At 15,400f, Bolivia's North Yungus Road - better known as 'The Death Road' - is among the nation's biggest draw cards for thrill-seeking tourists, even though it is estimated that 300 people die here every year. Dubbed 'El Camino de la Muerte' (The Death Road) by locals, for obvious reasons, and considered by many the most dangerous stretch of road in the world, the 40-mile journey from its summit entices in excess of 25,000 mountain bike riders annually. The ride takes in the stunning views among the rolling hills of the Amazon rainforest, but come with the somewhat distracting - and for some terrifying -sheer drop into the canopy as two rubber tyres separate the rider from a narrow single-lane road with very little in the way of railings. For the locals, the 'Death Road' is an important transport route which they brave in cars and trucks, teetering on the edge and risking their lives with every trip. For companies such as Gravity Bolivia, a cycling tour company that offers riders the opportunity to experience the once in a lifetime journey through clouds and waterfalls, it's big business."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Adventurous tourists can experience extreme tours worldwide.

European pilots and cabin crew are calling for shorter flying times to protect passenger safety. Organized by the European Cockpit Association (ECA), and the European Transport Workers' Federation (ETF), protesters are demanding that European Union rules on flying times are brought into line with scientific evidence. The Moebus Report -- mandated by the EU in September 2008 -- recommends that an airline crew should not operate for more than 13 hours during the day and 10 hours at night. Current EU rules stipulate pilots work up to a maximum of 14 hours during the day and nearly 12 hours at night. Are you concerned at the hours worked by airline pilots? Tell us. Speaking from one of the protests outside the European Parliament in Brussels, Captain Martin Chalk, President of the ECA told CNN: \"At the moment, the EU level is not adequate. That's not our view that is the view of experts employed to review the EU's own level of protection.\" Chalk said that despite being in possession of the report, the EU completely ignored the recommendations when they produced new fatigue proposals in January 2009. The ECA and the ETF have printed over 100,000 dummy airline tickets which they will hand out to airline passengers. The tickets contain cigarette-style warnings giving details on crew fatigue and an explanation as to why the EU current legislation needs to be changed. \"All we are trying to do at this stage is raise public's awareness. We're not trying to get in anyone's way,\" Chalk said. Hundreds of protesters are attending events taking place at 22 airports across Europe. 400 ECA members are expected to attend the protests at Madrid airport. \"What we are saying today is that they need to listen to the safety review,\" Chalk said. \"It was conducted by the best scientists in this field in Europe. It was commissioned by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and therefore it should not be ignored when writing the rules.\" Francois Ballestero, Political Secretary of the ETF echoed Chalk's concerns. \"Flight safety is the core mission of every cabin crew member. But EU law is insufficient to ensure that air crew can perform their safety role in an alert and effective way,\" he said. But the EASA were critical of the protests and their timing. \"This is jumping the gun. It is not a constructive contribution to a debate which is yet to happen,\" Daniel Hoeltgen, EASA communications director told CNN. Hoeltgen believes that the pilots are simply setting up stall for an industrial debate between the unions and the airlines. \"It's got nothing to do with safety regulations. We have made it clear that we will invite the unions and the airlines to take part in a review of the current rules and the timeframe for that has been made clear.\" The current law in Europe on air crew fatigue is set at two different levels. There is a minimum level set by EU and then there is a level set by individual countries that can be better than that minimum level. In 2012 the EU level is due to come into force. \"There needs to be a change in the law to protect passengers and our members from the insidious effects of airport fatigue,\" Chalk said.

The 7-year-old was profoundly disabled because of his autism. Unable to speak, he withdrew from people at school and, worse, from his family. In March 2003, Miller was introduced to Jeff Hancock, a one-on-one therapist for people with autism, and things started to feel a little more manageable. Hancock was hired to be John's companion. The two would go people-watching at the mall in Stuart, Florida, on the weekends. Hancock chatted throughout their excursions, even though John couldn't talk back. Their relationship evolved when Hancock introduced John to the Special Olympics in Martin County. Hancock, a longtime volunteer for the organization, and Miller decided John should get involved in sports after they saw a rare sight: Whenever John was running or being active, he was smiling. Up until that point, Miller said, it was virtually impossible to get John involved with sports because of his condition. \"There were very few people who knew how to handle a disability as severe as John's,\" she said. \"Even teachers and professionals were unable to reach him.\" One area of difficulty was communication. John couldn't speak and was mainly unresponsive to people. And people distanced themselves when they saw the teen injure himself. John would bite his arms and hands and even hit himself with powerful blows to the head, Miller said. As John got older, his behavioral issues intensified. But while teachers and peers drew away, Hancock stood closer by his side. When John turned 12, Hancock introduced him to track at the Special Olympics. For the first three years, the pair just observed the sport by watching practices and events. Hancock worked daily with John, showing him everything, including where to sit, stand and walk, so he would understand the flow of the events. Eventually, the lessons clicked, and John was off doing 50-meter sprints. John was racing because he loved to run, not because he wanted to compete, Hancock explained. \"Winning is not in his vocabulary. We put him in smaller races so that he could finish,\" Hancock said. Finishing the races was a way to boost John's confidence. \"He learned that when he finished the race he could see his mom, and get a drink, and get hugs.\" But as John got older, he got stronger and faster. At 16, he was jumping hurdles and doing 800-meter races. Miller started seeing her son as a serious athlete. Off the field, John was closed off to the world, but on the track he shined. \"John's head will be down a lot when he is trying to have social interactions. But when he is running, his form is perfect,\" she said. John even verbalizes on the field, joyously yelling. \"It sounds like he is happy,\" Miller said. In May 2014, John's training brought him to the Special Olympics State Summer Games in Orlando. The 18-year-old was competing in the 800 meters and the 110-meter hurdles. As the 800 was setting up, Miller remembered, she pressed her face against the fence, anxiously waiting for John to compete. The lanes were filled and the runners took their positions. Miller's mind raced: Would John would be OK in front of hundreds of cheering spectators? Would he would trip? Would he even finish? But as soon as the race started, her fears melted away, and all Miller saw was an athlete, her athlete. \"I just wanted to see the best performance. It seemed much more significant than whether he would ever speak or respond to me,\" she said. John ended up winning the gold medal for the 800. Sports completely changed John, and Miller said that is because of Hancock. \"A person with a disability can feel hopeless and isolated, and I think that can happen to parents, too. Jeff probably saw that with us,\" Miller said, thinking back to when Hancock first met their family. \"John was never expected to be an athlete,\" Miller said. \"But if John could speak, he would say his coach always expected it.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "John, a non-verbal autistic child with severe behavioral issues, was introduced to track at the Special Olympics by his therapist, Jeff Hancock.

Now she's heading off to the championship match against a tough Japan team, a much-awaited contest set for Sunday in Frankfurt, Germany -- where the U.S. can win the tournament for a record third time. The 31-year-old Wambach, speaking to CNN in a phone interview on Thursday, bubbled with confidence, patriotism, and enthusiasm as the team bids to follow up its 1991 and 1999 successes. She thinks the United States can beat Japan, a team emboldened to score a victory for a nation wracked with tragedy this year after an earthquake and tsunami devastated the country. Who will star at the women's World Cup? Japan, she said, is a \"possession-oriented\" squad that's \"technical on the ball.\" \"We have to be patient. We're going to get chances and have moments where we can score goals, and I think physically we're going to be able to dominate them,\" she said. \"So, if we can take care of the chances that we get, put away goals early on.\" Wambach, according to her bio on the U.S. team website, has \"developed into one of the most dangerous goal scorers in the world\" and is \"one of the world's best players in the air\" -- as proven by her heading skills. The U.S. advanced to the final after defeating France 3-1 in the semifinals on Wednesday. Wambach scored the second in the 79th minute with a dramatic header, her third goal of the tournament so far. And her last-gasp headed goal against Brazil on Sunday -- which got her an ESPN ESPY award for \"best play\" -- helped the U.S. level at 2-2 and take the quarterfinal to a penalty shootout, in which she also scored. Can World Cup spark women's soccer surge? \"Some say maybe it was perfect timing for us,\" she said, noting she was humbled and honored by the ESPY award. \"We believe it's our destiny.\" People are gathering in sports bars to cheer on the U.S. team, and the American support for the World Cup team has thrilled the players. \"Pretty amazing,\" said Wambach. \"We really want to make everybody back home proud. We're going to keep this thing going. We have this huge game on Sunday and if we can all play well and keep giving our most and leave everything on the field, hopefully we'll come home as World Cup champs.\" Wambach was asked whether she will have another shot at a World Cup, which is played every four years. \"It's a good question but right now my focus is here (in Germany),\" she said. \"This team is special. And this team, I can't put my finger on what makes this team so special, but the fact is we just don't give up. We're not quitters. We won't give up for the entire 90 minutes that we play on Sunday. \"I think we can do this. I know that the players on my team, the coaches, the staff, we've all put so much time and effort into training and preparing for this. We're not going to let it go lightly.

Many security experts have already voiced concerns that fingerprint scanners, such as the one in Apple's new iPhone 5S, are flawed and not as secure as their makers claim. Now one leading security researcher has taken this a step further suggesting the technology could actually lead to an increase in crime, with the robberies potentially becoming more brutal. Marc Rogers from San Francisco-based firm Lookout said: 'Fingerprints are not fool-proof and can be duplicated and as the usage of this technology increases, we can expect that duplication technology will improve as well. 'Thieves in some regions have worked out that you can force a victim to unlock a secured device,' and in extreme cases this brutality could lead to fingers being cut off. Scroll down for video . Apple said the Touch ID fingerprint sensor is designed to provide 'accurate readings from any angle, so the motion to unlock your device ought to be as automatic as it is now' The Touch ID sensor is built into the . premium phone's 'home' button and can be used to unlock the phone, as . well as pay for shopping and apps automatically. Speaking at the launch event in Cupertino, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller reassured users that Touch ID is secure by explaining that 'all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip' adding the prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud. Yet Rogers claims it shouldn't be used on its own. 'Unlocking . a device with a fingerprint, if done right, can be much more convenient . than entering a pin code multiple times a day.' 'So many users fail to enable [PINs] altogether and in this case, fingerprint scanning is better than nothing at all, but it provides little added security over a four-digit code. 'And because fingerprints can be lifted and duplicated, they should not be used as the sole credential in a high security scenario unless enhanced through the use of a PIN code or other secondary factor of authentication.' Apple announced that its iPhone 5S, pictured, has a fingerprint scanner built into the 'home' button. Apple has stated that the Touch ID sensor is 'capacitive' which means that it will only work with live fingers that have a recognisable pulse . Touch ID uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger. Users can 'train' their iPhone to . read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home . button, the phone is unlocked. Touch ID can also be replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books. It uses a 'laser cut sapphire . crystal' to take a high-resolution image scan before the Touch ID software in iOS 7 . detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not. All fingerprint information is . encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip. The prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud. Apple has also stated that the Touch ID sensor is 'capacitive' which means that it will only work with live fingers that have a recognisable pulse. Paul Ducklin from Sophos Security agreed: 'Fingerprints are not secret: we leave copies of them wherever we go. Once someone devious has got hold of a copy, sensors can be fooled.' He continues that, unlike passwords, if fingerprint information is stolen it can't be changed 'short of getting medieval on your hands with acid, sandpaper or some other hardened-gangster technique.' Fingerprint authentication has become common in high-end laptops from companies such as Dell, Lenovo and Toshiba. Motorola also added a fingerprint scanner to its Atrix handset. Apple unveiled the fingerprint . scanner on its iPhone 5S on Tuesday with bold claims about its high . levels of encryption and security. The . firm even suggested that its Touch ID system could revolutionise . smartphone security and replace the traditional, everyday password.

Apple phones . in China cost around the same amount as the average person's monthly . salary in urban areas, or three months wages for a bus driver, for . example. The 5S is due . to sell in China for 5,288 yuan (\u00a3547) and the 5C for 4,488 yuan (\u00a3464) and the handsets, which will be available from 20 September, will be . launched in China at the same time as other major territories for the . first time ever.

For the aspirational, willing to bend their backs and broaden their minds, the materials for a dream house are all around us; in tin cans, tires and scrap metal, ready for construction projects anywhere from city centers to tropical islands at minimal expense. Cooler containers . High concept architects Infiniski of Spain have carved a niche in recycled construction that does not compromise on aesthetics. Their stylish designs are spreading through Europe, Asia and Latin America, with around 85% of the materials pre-used. The basic components are shipping containers supplemented with wooden pallets, which in addition to dramatically reducing cost, also have the benefit of providing a cooling effect in hot climates. Cano's Castle . Thousands of square meters of scrap aluminum came together for this towering complex in Colorado, courtesy of Donald 'Cano' Espinoza, a Native American veteran of the Vietnam War. Beer cans, hubcaps and window frames provide much of the raw material for four separate buildings, with four floors in the largest. Cano uses the gleaming site as a farm and reportedly does not encourage visitors. Save the Beach hotel . Launched in Madrid in 2010, the brainchild of German 'garbage artist' H.A. Schult -- who had also produced a whole army from trash. The hotel was constructed from the contents of landfills and beaches to highlight the environmental impact of waste. The rooms were fully disinfected to allow guests to sleep safely, and the hotel took an international tour to raise awareness. How to build your home from scratch for $35,000 . Don Justo's Cathedral . An astonishing labour of love, for over 50 years former monk and farmer Justo Gallego has been singlehandedly creating a cathedral close to Madrid, modeled on St Peter's basilica in Rome. Standing over 40 meters high, complete with cloisters, crypt and grand domes, the epic structure has been built entirely from discarded materials; broken bricks and tiles for the walls and oil drums for the columns. Despite working from 4am each day, 89-year-old Gallego may still require another decade to complete the project. Joyxee Island . British artist Richart 'Rishi' Sowa built himself one floating island in Mexico, but when that was destroyed by a hurricane, he replaced it with Joyxee. Measuring a spacious 20 meters in diameter, the island floats on 100,000 plastic bottles with cabins of recycled wood. Complete with beaches and waterfall, the island has become a popular tourist attraction as well as an extravagant home for Sowa. Home sweet homeless . Designer Gregory Kloehn re-purposed a New York dumpster into an apartment, featuring a separated kitchen, bathroom and sun deck. He then expanded the concept, accessorizing waste disposal units further with abandoned washing machine, bicycle tires and scrap wood, for as little as $30 a time. Several of these have been made available for the city's homeless community. Earthship Biotecture . Originating in New Mexico, the Earthship designers are now exporting their sustainable building principles as far afield as Malawi and Haiti. Steel-belted rubber provides the primary building component for the distinctively shaped off-grid structures, with interior walls composed of colored glass from reclaimed bottles. Energy is also harvested from the immediate environment at minimal cost. The company run courses across the world teaching their methods adapted to local resources. Would you live in a house made of sand and bacteria? Toothbrush house . An entirely recycled concept creation in the British city of Brighton draws on an imaginative range of construction materials. Thousands of toothbrushes and video tapes make up the wall insulation, bicycle tires hold the windows in place, with supporting roles for denim jeans and chalk waste. The \"house of waste\" will be monitored over a trial period to determine whether the design could be reproduced at scale. A place in the woods .

The reaction online was pretty much what you'd expect, with -- as The Next Web noted -- hashtags like \"Facebookmageddon\" and \"Facebocalypse\" common amongst Twitter users. So what happened, exactly? There was an issue with the Facebook Connect API that caused users on sites that use that API to redirect users to a Facebook error page. For example, if you were visiting Mashable and logged into our site using your Facebook account (and you were also signed into Facebook), you were automatically redirected to a Facebook error page. Exiting the page or attempting to re-access the original site would lead to another. Sites such as The Huffington Post, Kayak, Hulu, The Daily Dot, Pinterest and hundreds of others were all impacted. The bug lasted less than 10 minutes. In a statement, Facebook told Mashable: \"For a short period of time, there was a bug that redirected people logging in with Facebook from third party sites.

It also shows that if Facebook has an issue, it can affect more than just its site -- it can also impact the hundreds of thousands (millions?) of sites that integrate with Facebook's APIs. What's interesting is that a user didn't even need to be performing the action for the error -- and hijacking -- to occur.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\n(CNN) -- They are global sporting superstars, and they've got a story to tell. From former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson to ex-England captain David Beckham it seems everyone is releasing autobiographies in a blaze of promotion and headline grabbing excerpts -- and all in time for Christmas. But whether the intention is to set the record straight, settle a few old scores or simply tell it like it is, the majority tend to live and die by their ghost writer. Trying to capture the authenticity of the subject's voice and cram the book full of interesting anecdotes can be a daunting task. But with the help of one respected author of several big football autobiographies, Ian Ridley, whose book on former England captain Tony Adams sold a million copies, here are 10 key components to a successful sporting tome. Story telling . Perhaps the most obvious commandment for any sporting book is that the subject matter has to be interesting. While a big name can usually be guaranteed to bring with them a loyal following who will buy whatever they release, the more casual observer needs a little more persuasion. Ridley's most famous subject was former England soccer captain Tony Adams, who famously battled alcohol addiction throughout the most successful parts of his career. Another focused on former footballer Steve Claridge's issues with betting while his most recent, on former English Premier League referee Mark Halsey dealt with his recovery from cancer. \"The subject of the book has to be honest about these things,\" Ridley told CNN. \"As a writer you have to press ever detail out of them and make sure you draw out the material.\" Capture the voice . Any book must bring the character to life in their own words -- it is no good having David Beckham hypothesizing over the French renaissance period. But get the ex-England captain talking about the influence of Alex Ferguson on his career or any of his famous 'hairdryer' moments and people will be gripped. \"You have to capture their voice,\" Ridley explains. \"Ghostwriting is much more of a skill than is recognized.\" One good example is the recent autobiography of Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, entitled 'I am Zlatan', that manages to captures his supreme confidence. For instance, the Paris Saint-Germain forward, who continually refers to himself in the third person, notes: \"An injured Zlatan is a properly serious thing for any team.\" Mining the seam . The odd five minute chat here or there isn't going to cut it -- an author needs to live and breathe his subject for months if not years. That dictum is especially crucial if your sporting figure isn't particularly effusive at the outset -- as the relationship between the two grows so does the material. \"With the Adams book (the process) took about 18 months,\" Ridley said. \"Don't forget this was in the days before the Internet, which meant research was a lot more time consuming. Initially we did three months of interviews -- about 40 hours of tape.\" Lessen outside influences . Obviously, the publisher is king in the process but Ridley says it is important to keep their influence -- and pressure -- to a minimum. \"I have never been under pressure from a publisher and I have never extended a deadline,\" he said. \"As a journalist you are used to meeting deadlines and of course you don't get paid until you deliver the manuscript. \"I have never been told how to structure a book, though in the editing process they might come back and say we need more of this and we would have a discussion about that.\" Any publicity is good publicity . That old adage rings true even more than ever in the instant digital world of today. Despite huge chunks of Ferguson's books being reproduced -- much to the chagrin of his ghostwriter Paul Hayward -- it helped get the juicier bits of the text out in front of the public. \"You get worried they are ignoring the depth of the book,\" Ridley says. \"Such is the difficulty of selling books. But any publicity is good publicity. \"There isn't the bravery or the courage anymore in publishing especially with anything that isn't mainstream.\" Drown out the detractors . Any autobiography worth its weight is bound to offend someone or other -- the more the better in terms of publicity -- but it is important the author sticks to his guns. Ridley's book on Adams contained a plethora of sensational snippets from the footballer''s life, not all of them savory and saccharine. When the proofs were sent to David Dein -- then former vice-president of Adams' club Arsenal -- he was deeply unhappy says Ridley and was worried it painted the club in a bad light. But after pointing out the consequences to Dein of attempting to gag Adams, Ridley saw the ex-Arsenal vice-president's attitude completely change upon the book's publication. \"When the book was released Dein came over to me with a smile on his face and said it was flying off the shelves in the club shop. He was delighted.\" Get it serialized . Any self respecting autobiography must be trailed in a leading national newspaper to ensure maximum coverage ahead of its release. Not only does this help to prick the nation's consciousness it can provide some valuable income in a world where the digital market is shredding the publishing industry slowly and steadily. Serialization deals sometimes outweigh the advance for a book thanks to a lot of big names releasing books than turned out to be big duds. \"The publishing industry is in a mess in terms of the digital revolution, especially selling books in hard cover and paperback,\" Ridley said. \"Publishers have been burnt by ordinary sports books that were so dull, but that huge sums had been paid for. Now advances are very poor and you get what you can for serialization rights.\" Press the flesh . Despite smashing UK sales records by selling 115,547 in its first week of release and making \u00a31.4 million ($2.24m), Ferguson is still hitting the road for a series of speaking events to promote his autobiography. All but one of the six dates dotted around the UK have sold out and cost \u00a340 a ticket, which includes a signed copy of the book that is currently retailing at \u00a325 ($40). Not only does this help with sales but it also helps to keep Ferguson and his book in the public eye, with many newspapers -- both regional and national -- covering the events. Embrace the digital revolution . These days social media plays a huge role in the promotion of sports books with Twitter and Facebook campaigns an integral part of any launch. As part of Beckham's media blitz the public were invited to a 'global book signing' via the former Los Angeles Galaxy star's Facebook page, whch has 30.5 million 'likes.'. Fans from across the globe were able to get a personalized digital autograph on e-books from Beckham, during a session that included a question and answer section. \"I always like innovative and original ideas,\" said Beckham. \"What has been created is ambitious but it should be a fantastic event. \"I love the interaction with my fans, but not only will I be able to do this in London, I will be able to sign for them in locations across the world.\" Be determined . An extension of 'drowning out the detractors' includes a commitment to getting the book out on the streets in the first place. When Ridley and Halsey lost a publishing deal they determined to print it themselves -- in Lithuania. There followed three months of under-the-radar work that felt like the plot of a spy novel,\" Ridley said. \"For guns, read books. I was introduced to a middle man who ran the merchandise to printers in Lithuania.\" But the hard work has been worth it with Halsey's book garnering bags of column inches in the media and plenty of publicity.

In the end, the lawyer for Katherine Jackson, who was not a party to the lawsuit, mediated the agreement, which gives the estate $2.5 million from the several companies involved. A federal judge had already ruled that Howard Mann and several associated companies violated Jackson's copyrights, which are controlled by his estate executors, and the only question for a jury was how much should be paid in damages. \"In light of the court's rulings for the estate on summary judgment, this settlement seems appropriate for all concerned,\" estate lawyers Howard Weitzman and Zia Modabber said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. Mann's company published Katherine Jackson's 150-page coffee table book \"Never Can Say Goodbye, The Katherine Jackson Story\" two years ago and established a website -- MichaelJacksonSecretVault.com -- that the estate argued illegally used Jackson's images and lyrics. \"This was a long, complex and difficult litigation that in the end will likely be equitable for Mrs. Jackson and the other parties involved,\" Mann said. \"This settlement would not have been possible without Perry Sanders (Katherine Jackson's lawyer), who worked to bridge quite a distance.\" \"I really really appreciated the reasonableness of all parties involved, and everyone is served well by getting this wrapped up,\" said Sanders, who helped mediate the settlement this week. The resolution of the dispute represents a new twist in the contentious relationship between the executors who control Michael Jackson's estate and the members of the Jackson family and some of their business associates. E-mails show promoter's doubts before Michael Jackson's death . Mann's involvement with the Jacksons began when he partnered with Henry Vaccaro, who bought a large amount of Jackson memorabilia purchased at an auction after Katherine and Joe Jackson's 1999 bankruptcy. A lien will be placed on those photos and other assets until a portion of the settlement is paid, a lawyer said. Katherine Jackson was not a defendant, but her name and those of her husband, Joe Jackson, and children Janet, Randy, Tito and Jermaine Jackson were on the defense witness list. The estate accused Mann of \"wholesale misappropriation\" of Michael Jackson copyrights and acting with \"arrogant disregard\" for the estate's rights by using unauthorized images .

The nine-page letter from Brussels to the Prime Minister says the scheme would break laws governing the free movement of goods. The Home Office proposal is to ban the sale of alcohol for less than 45p per unit in an effort to target heavy drinkers. 'Turn back': The European Commission warned Cameron that minimum pricing contravenes laws governing the free movement of goods . It will mean that wine cannot be sold for less than about \u00a34.05 a bottle, beer will be at least 90p a can and a stand-size bottle of vodka will cost at least \u00a311.70. The average family drinks bill will soar . by almost \u00a3100 a year under the Government\u2019s plan for minimum pricing . for alcohol, it was revealed last night. In the leaked letter, the European Commission advised the Treasury to increase duty on alcoholic drinks if it wishes to raise the price, the Scottish Daily Mail revealed. The Government appears to be ignoring the legal warning, however, and is forging ahead with the plan, claiming it will save hundreds of lives and millions of pounds of public money each year by cutting crime and . health problems linked to binge drinking. Wine-producing nations such as France, . Italy and Spain are planning to take Britain to court for breaching the . EU law on free trade. Research has found that 59 per cent of all alcoholic units sold in off-licences and supermarkets cost less than 45p per unit \u2013 meaning their price will go up. Increase: An average family's drinks bill will rise by almost \u00a3100 if Government plans to increase the minimum price of alcohol . A couple who drink the average amount will see their annual grocery bill rise by around \u00a394 a year. The finding by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) is a blow for the Government\u2019s claim that the plan will target only binge drinkers. European officials have already written to Alex Salmond, the Scottish First Minister, to warn that Scotland\u2019s 50p minimum price plan may contravene EU rules. The UK Government had gone to court to keep the embarrassing letter to Mr Salmond secret - now it emerges that they have had one of their own. Catherine Day, of the European Commission, explained that supermarkets would simply sell more alcohol to boost profits, and she said the plan would create \u2018market distortions\u2019. Miss Day said: \u2018The UK authorities are invited to abstain from adopting the draft legislation at issue.\u2019 The Government believes imposing a 45p minimum unit price will reduce total alcohol consumption by 3.3 per cent, and cut the number of crimes by 5,000 per year and hospital admissions by 24,000. There will be 700 fewer alcohol-linked deaths annually, according to the predictions. However, the IFS said that while ministers are right to say the heaviest drinkers will be the most affected by price rises, there will also be an impact on moderate drinkers. Those who drink less than seven units a week will see grocery bills rise, because 48 per cent of the units they buy tend to be less than 45p. The IFS research also found that one of the drinks most associated with binge drinking - alcopops - will hardly be affected by the minimum price at all, because it almost always costs more than 45p a unit anyway. Clash of opinion: Home Office minister Damian Green, right, said cheap alcohol contributes to 'harmful levels of drinking' while Catherine Day, left, of the European Commission, said the plan would create 'market distortions' In contrast, 72 per cent of the units . in lager sold in shops, 70 per cent of the units in spirits and 46 per . cent of units in table wine cost less than 45p and will therefore be . affected. They found that . if no one changes their habits in response to the price rises, the . minimum price will simply transfer \u00a31.4billion from consumers to . off-licences and supermarkets. Miles Beale, of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said: \u2018Minimum unit pricing and the proposed restrictions to promotions are wholly untargeted and will unfairly punish millions of consumers and businesses in the UK, while doing nothing to tackle the root causes of alcohol misuse or associated crime and disorder. \u2018Alcohol misuse is a serious and complex problem for a small number of people in this country.\u2019 The report confirms that low-income families will see the largest increases in prices, because they are most likely to buy cheap alcohol. And they say there is no evidence the plan will actually reduce harmful drinking. \u2018The most important issue in determining the impact of minimum pricing will be whether those who generate the greatest social harms from their consumption drink less as a result of the policy,\u2019 the report said. \u2018That will depend on how well targeted on those drinkers a minimum price is, and how their consumption responds to price rises - something we know relatively little about.\u2019 Home Office minister Damian Green told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u2018The evidence is clear - the availability of cheap alcohol contributes to harmful levels of drinking. It can\u2019t be right that it is possible to purchase a can of beer for as little as 20p. \u2018Too many of us have seen city centres on a Friday and Saturday night often become a vision of hell. A lot of this is fuelled by very cheap, very strong alcohol.\u2019"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The UK's 45p minimum alcohol price proposal, deemed illegal by the European Commission, could face legal action from wine-producing nations.

Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal allegedly told a top executive at Columbia Pictures, which distributes the Bond films, that 'Idris should be the next bond'. It is latest piece of information to emerge from the Sony hacking scandal, which resulted in the cancelling of the Christmas Day release of The Interview. Scroll down for video . British actor Idris Elba, 42 (left), who has starred in The Wire and Luther, could replace Daniel Craig, 46, (right) as the next James Bond when his contract ends after the next film, if leaked Sony emails are to be believed . Hackers threatened 9/11-style terrorist attacks on cinemas showing the comedy about two journalists \u2013 played by actors James Franco and Seth Rogen \u2013 who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The federal government confirmed on Wednesday that North Korea was behind the massive hack of Sony, which saw thousands of internal emails  leaked. According to the Daily Beast, an email sent on January 4 from Ms Pascal to Elizabeth Cantillon, former executive vice president of production for Columbia Pictures, simply said: 'Idris should be the next bond (sic).' If Elba, from Hackney, east London, did follow in Daniel Craig's footsteps, he would become the first black James Bond. Previous actors to portray 007 on the big screen include Pierce Brosnan, Roger Moore and Sean Connery. Many have voiced support for Elba to play the British spy, including actor Jamie Foxx who said in an interview earlier this year that he was a big fan of the idea. Elba himself has also previously expressed desire to play the British spy, telling website Reddit that he would take the role. 'Yes. if it was offered to me, absolutely,' he said. An email sent on January 4 from Sony co-chairman Amy Pascal (pictured) to Elizabeth Cantillon, former executive vice president of production for Columbia Pictures, allegedly said: 'Idris should be the next bond' The leaked email comes as filming for the latest instalment of the James Bond franchise gets underway. Actor Daniel Craig, 46, has seen filming on the River Thames, outside London's  Secret Service MI6 headquarters . A Facebook group called 'We want Idris Elba for James Bond', which was set up before the leak, also has more than 30,000 likes. The leaked email comes as filming for the latest instalment of the James Bond franchise gets underway. Spectre, which follows on from the 2002 release of Skyfall, will be released in the UK in November next year. Daniel Craig, who is in contract to play Bond for one more movie at Spectre, could be seen filming on the River Thames, outside London's famed Secret Service MI6 headquarters, last week. The Liverpudlian, 46, could also be seen stood in the window of an apartment in Notting Hill, west London, filming scenes for the 24th James Bond film. Spectre was announced on December 4 and stars including Monica Bellucci (Lucia Sciarra), Christoph Waltz (Oberhauser), and L\u00e9a Seydoux (Madeleine Swann) have all been confirmed for the movie. However, the announcement was not without hiccup. The Sony hacking resulted in the film's original scripts being leaked, forcing producers to rewrite the plot line and bring in additional writers to help make changes to the ending. The leak also revealed that Spectre has a budget of over $300 million, which is $50 million more than its predecessor. Pierce Brosnan played James Bond in four of the films from 1995 to 2002, including Die Another Day . If\u00a0Idris Elba did become the next actor to portray the British Spy, he would follow in the footsteps of Daniel Craig, Pierce\u00a0Brosnan, Timothy Dalton, Roger Moore, George Lazenby\u00a0and Sean Connery. Craig, 46, is set to play Bond in next year's release of Spectre. He has previously portrayed 007 in Skyfall\u00a0(2012), Quantum of Solace (2008) and Casino Royale (2006). Brosnan played the spy in Die Another Day (2002), The World Is Not Enough (1999), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and GoldenEye (1995). Dalton portrayed Bond in Licence to Kill (1989) and The Living Daylights (1987).

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\nLondon, England (CNN) -- The British government wants to find out what makes people happy. Is it good health, education, income, or job satisfaction? Is it the environment, a lack of crime, or having a say in politics? Those aspects of life can't be measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), long used as a key indicator of a nation's prosperity, British Prime Minister David Cameron says. Thursday, he launched a national survey to ask people which aspects matter most to them, and which they believe should be used to measure the nation's well-being. Though Cameron has championed this initiative since at least 2006, when he was still leader of the opposition -- suggesting a focus on GWB, or \"general well-being\" -- he still defended the idea Thursday against suspicions \"that all this is a bit airy-fairy and impractical.\" \"Of course you can't capture happiness on a spreadsheet any more than you can bottle it,\" he said in announcing the program. \"If anyone was trying to reduce the whole spectrum of human emotion into one snapshot statistic, I would be the first to roll my eyes, but that isn't what this is about. \"Just as the GDP figures don't give the full story of our economy's growth, but do give a useful indicator of where we're heading, so this new measure won't give the full story of our nation's well-being, but will give us a general picture of how life is improving.\" An online survey for individuals will run until April, when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) will send out surveys to large households. The results of both will be collected and analyzed, with results to come out in 2012, the ONS said. Cameron said he knows some think the project is a \"distraction\" from the more urgent economic problems Britain must address, and that some think there is no way the government can hope to improve people's well-being. Getting the economy moving, and creating jobs and spreading opportunity, is still the government's most urgent priority, Cameron said -- but there need to be better ways than just GDP to assess the country's growth and progress. \"When a country is hit by an earthquake, that can increase GDP because of the extra spending on reconstruction afterwards,\" he said. \"When a city is torn apart by crime and disorder, that can increase GDP because of all the extra locks and security people buy. When a person falls seriously ill, that can increase GDP because the cost of buying drugs and paying for care counts as economic activity.\" Initiatives regarded as good for growth sometimes have negative effects on the quality of life, he said -- such as loose controls on immigration, which can affect public services, or cheap prices on alcohol that can lead to more incidents of crime. \"It's because of this fundamentally flawed approach that for decades Western societies have seen the line of GDP rising steadily upwards, but at the same time, levels of contentment have remained static or even fallen,\" Cameron said. Cameron said government can't legislate for fulfillment or satisfaction, but it can boost well-being by finding out what will improve lives and then acting on it. \"In time it will lead to government policy that is more focused not just on the bottom line, but on all those things that make life worthwhile,\" he said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "UK PM David Cameron, in collaboration with the Office for National Statistics, has launched a happiness survey.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\n(CNN) -- Whatever other resolutions we make leading up to the New Year -- to call Mom more often, lay off the late-night snacks -- getting ourselves organized is likely near the top of the list. And that often means clearing out the clutter that keeps us from functioning efficiently, whether we're at work or at home. Many employees -- whether they go to actual offices or do their jobs from home -- find the last week of the calendar year is ideal for sorting through e-mails, clearing their desks, and reorganizing their work spaces. Sorting through stuff is rarely fun, but those who tackle it now will find themselves a step ahead when their now-vacationing colleagues and clients come staggering back after the holidays. According to the National Association of Professional Organizers, which sponsors the annual \"Get Organized Month\" each January to help folks take control of their time, tasks and possessions, 83% of members polled say that \"paper organization\" ranks highest on their individual and corporate clients' to-do lists. For people taking time off between Christmas and New Year's, this week offers a chance to get things in order before 2013 arrives. Devoting time to both physically and mentally clearing out the \"old\" and embracing the \"new\" is about more than just getting rid of stuff. Being organized is really about being in control, says Susan Fleischman, a Chicago-based professional organizer, home stager and founder of clutterfree. \"As joyous as the holidays can be, the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's is probably one of the most stressful of the year for people,\" she says. That's why spending the week after Christmas decluttering \"really helps you recover and detox from the hustle and bustle of the holidays. \"It's very symbolic -- we're ramping up to the ultimate do-over. We all get to turn the calendar page and make a fresh start.\" For those at work, says Fleischman, \"the phone stops ringing, there are fewer meetings. Real work probably comes to a screeching halt. There are far fewer reasons to keep letting getting organized fall to the bottom of the to-do list.\" And these days, when employees often feel compelled to work harder and longer, being organized can be a real competitive advantage. NAPO Industry Member Director Mary Dykstra says that on average, Americans waste time amounting to between six and 12 weeks a year searching for things in their offices and homes. \"Just imagine if you could get out from under that clutter and spend that time helping your company build their business and ultimately, your career,\" says Fleischman, who was a public relations and marketing executive before launching her professional organizing business. \"Every minute counts when it comes to impressing the boss, your colleagues and clients. At work, we strive to project that we're knowledgeable, in control and experts. We're constantly accessing, sharing, reacting to information. Being able to put your hands on the information or generate some information means the better you'll be able to rise to the top and have clarity of thought and creativity and maximize productivity.\" But what about moving from work to the home front? Cynthia Ewer, the Washington state-based editor of OrganizedHome.com and the author of \"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Getting Organized Fast-Track,\" suggests we use this in-between-holidays week to step back and reflect on our habits and how well they're working for us at home. It's important to remember, says Ewer, that \"there are different personality types. \"Organized\" is what works for you. There are filers -- people who love folders. They want the serenity of knowing where things are. Pilers like to keep their eyes on their stuff. Deniers have bags of paperwork shoved into closets. Instead of using a \"What-does-it-look-like?\" yardstick, it's a \"How-will-it-work?\" question. Know yourself, and come up with solutions that reflect who you are, she says. After all, she says, \" 'It's here somewhere' is the most frustrating phrase in the English language.\" Cutting clutter also can boost the bottom line. \"How many times do you go to the store and buy the things you couldn't find?\" asks Fleischman. But cleaning up and cleaning out also can generate money, says Ewer. \"It can be a real fun process to turn your clutter into cash.\" Nab tax deductions by donating cleared-out items to nonprofit organizations. Declutterers can send usable books, DVDs, video games and music to third-party merchants in exchange for gift cards through the Amazon Trade-In Program. Even computer manufacturers like Apple offer gift cards to customers who send in an old iPhone, iPad or computer for reuse or recycling, if those devices still have monetary value. \"Leading an orderly life is about saving time, saving money, reducing stress,\" says Fleischman, who also blogs about organizing tips and clutter makeovers. \"And that's energy you can spend on leisure pursuits, which is very important to emotional well-being.\" Some tips for cutting through the workplace and home clutter this holiday week: . \u2022 Stockpile your supplies. Fleischman advises making sure you've got the right trash bins, shredders, file folders and markers at your fingertips before you start sorting and tossing. \u2022 Take it a zone at a time. Your office, home and car didn't become a mess overnight, so declutter in increments. Fleischman suggests starting with desktops, then floors, then moving on to file cabinets and bookcases. \u2022 Go from horizontal to vertical piles. If you're purging papers, clear those piles from your desk and the floor by placing newly sorted files in a cabinet or an upright vertical file. This way, your eyes can quickly scan and identify what you need at a glance. \u2022 Free up the fridge. \"Get the ghosts of Christmas past out of there -- all those little cans of this and that, the beef sticks from the gift basket no one can bear to throw out,\" says Ewer. Besides, this clean-up also will save you some calories. \u2022 Be realistic. If you really write out bills at the kitchen table and not in the home office, says Ewer, get yourself a wheeled cart you can roll where the work gets done. If your kids' toys actually live in the family room -- not in the bedroom toy box -- create a storage solution there. \"Look at your patterns of living and organize yourself accordingly.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Year-end decluttering is common.

This tiny island nation sits in the middle of the Mediterranean, about 60 miles south of Sicily and 180 miles east of the African coast at Tunisia. The result is that anyone who was anyone visited, settled, invaded or conquered this prime piece of land. And with each leaving their mark, a visit to Malta is truly a journey through the region's history. The Republic of Malta is actually three islands. The country's name comes from the largest of the three; to the northwest of that is Gozo, and in between them is Comino. And tiny really means tiny. At only 122 square miles (316 square kilometers), the total area of the country is about one-tenth the size of Rhode Island, by far the smallest of the United States. London, New York, Tokyo -- each of these metropolitan areas is bigger than Malta. That compactness, coupled with an extensive bus system, lets you see the best of what it has to offer with ease. Begin your journey through the millennia with the stone temples at \u0126a\u0121ar Qim and Mnajdra, on the southern coast. Construction on these sites started around 3600 BC, making them centuries older than the best guesses we have for England's Stonehenge. And the temples are every bit as mysterious, since it is not clear how or why they were built. The structures aren't as massive as their English counterpart, and they lack the graceful symmetry. Yet walk among the exposed chambers -- with the sea just beyond the cliffs -- and you know that the generations who built these temples believed they were constructing something for the ages. It is here that you start to get a sense of what sets a journey to Malta apart from Europe's more visited travel destinations. \u0126a\u0121ar Qim and Mnajdra are just two of seven ancient temples that make up a UNESCO World Heritage site described by a leading prehistorian as \"the oldest free-standing monuments in the world.\" These sites represent just one epoch of many you will find on your trip. Travel seven miles (11 kilometers) to the east -- and skip forward more than 2,000 years from the time the stones for those temples were laid -- and you will be standing where the first seafaring Phoenicians arrived on Malta from the eastern end of the Mediterranean. To this day the village of Marsaxlokk is a key port for the country's fishing industry, seen in the market held every Sunday and in the seafood restaurants lining the harbor. But look closely at the colorfully painted traditional fishing boats known as luzzu bobbing gently on the water, and you can't help but notice how they are still painted with the Eye of Osiris, a custom said to have been handed down by the Phoenicians to ward off evil. From Marsaxlokk head northwest 10 miles (16 kilometers) inland toward the walled city of Mdina, which sits on one of the highest plateaus on the island. Just outside the main gate of this walled city is the Domus Romana, or \"Roman house.\" Here we have moved forward another thousand years to when Malta was part of the Roman Republic. The Roman House is a museum built on the excavated ruins of a nobleman's home, dating back to sometime shortly after 100 B.C. While the museum on the main floor houses a respectable collection of artifacts, it is the excavated floors of the villa -- among the finest mosaics uncovered anywhere in the former empire -- that will astonish you. As for Mdina itself, the city's name comes from the Arabic word simply meaning \"the city,\" which belies its status as the former capital of Malta. A millennium after our Roman nobleman walked across his tiled floors Malta was part of the Fatimid Caliphate -- a form of government based on the tenets of Islam -- that stretched across northern Africa and into the Arabian Peninsula. It was during this period that the moat and walls that surround Mdina were first constructed. With few vehicles permitted today inside its gates, a walk through the narrow stone alleys of Mdina makes it clear why it is known locally as \"the silent city.\" For one of the best views anywhere on Malta, make your way to the upper terrace of the Fontanella Tea Garden restaurant. On a clear day over a cup of coffee you can see practically the entire island. While the island nation has changed hands countless times over the ages, the influence that is most widely felt in Malta today didn't come from an invading empire, but from a group known as the Knights Hospitallers, later the Knights of Malta. This order was first set up to run a hospital in Jerusalem for pilgrims who traveled there and eventually developed into a religious and military order. When Islamic forces pushed them out in 1291, the Knights re-established themselves first in Cyprus and then in Rhodes before arriving on Malta in the 16th century. It was in those first decades on the island that the Knights of Malta built the current capital, Valletta, following an unsuccessful siege by Ottoman forces. With its impenetrable stone walls and regular battle towers surrounding a regular grid of streets, the entire city stands as tribute to the order's military and engineering prowess. Within the battlements, the interiors of churches such as St John's Co-Cathedral, completed in 1577, are among the most ornate that you will find anywhere. These monuments, like those reaching back into prehistory, outlasted both their creators and those who followed to lay their own claim to Malta. The Knights were forced out by the French, when Napoleon invaded in 1798, who were expelled a couple years later by the British. World War II saw a failed attempt by Axis powers to bomb the country into submission. Independence came in 1964. Today Malta, still as staunchly Catholic as it was under the Knights, is content to take its place as part of the European Union. A trip to Malta is not merely a walk through a living history book. Along the way are stunning natural formations, like the Blue Grotto on the southern coast near the village of \u017burrieq. When the weather permits and seas are not too choppy, boats take visitors to the 140-foot-high natural stone arch and surrounding caves. Of course, on an island this small you are never far from the coast, though sun seekers often head to the beaches of the northern resort of Mellie\u0127a to soak in the rays. The caf\u00e9s and wine bars of modern-day Valletta make you feel like you're in southern Italy, as will much of the cuisine. The nightlife at the clubs in St. Julian's, just north of Valletta, can hold its own against just about anything the rest of Europe has to offer. Prices for hotels and restaurants overall are less than on mainland Europe, especially in the off-season, and the bus system on Malta makes getting around simple and affordable. Full-day tickets are only \u20ac1.50 (about $2.) You can get pretty much anywhere from the main terminal just outside the Valletta city gate. No matter where you go and what you see, Malta's unique spot -- in the Mediterranean and in history -- is felt everywhere."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Malta, near Sicily and Tunisia, offers historical sites, modern attractions, and efficient public transportation.

A teenager was strangled to death by her scarf in a freak go-karting accident after being given no safety instructions before she took to the track, an inquest heard. Suzanne Cornwell, 18, was fatally injured when the garment got caught in the engine of her kart during an out-of-hours race in December 2009 - the first time she had ever tried the sport. An inquest into her death today in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, heard how Suzanne was one of six friends invited to the track by employee Andy Kivlin. Tragic: Suzanne Cornwell (above) was strangled to death after her scarf got caught in the engine of her go-kart, an inquest heard . But Mr Kivlin failed to give the novice driver any safety advice, or tell her to wear protective overalls and remove her scarf, which was standard practise for normal bookings at the track. After the accident, Mr Kivlin \u2018panicked\u2019 and told one of the group to\u00a0 cancel the 999 call, saying he would take her to hospital in his car, the hearing was told. The coroner also heard how Mr Kivlin had not been given permission by the owner to let his friends use the track. It also emerged another member of the group, Melissa Rees-Howell, who was Mr Kivlin\u2019s girlfriend at the time, had been told to remove her scarf by him on a previous out-of-hours session. 'Failure': An employee of Cambridgeshire Raceway (above) in Caxton did not give Suzanne any safety instructions before the out-of-hours race in December 2009, it was heard . Coroner David Morris heard evidence from Christopher Hamilton, who used to work at the raceway, that the DVD player used to show customers a safety film had broken and not been replaced. He said: 'If you saw anyone with long hair or baggy clothes you told them to tuck it in. It was the same with shoe laces. 'I felt I was thrown into the deep end. I wasn\u2019t given any training for the safety briefings and I didn\u2019t feel confident. 'About a month in, the DVD player broke and was not replaced, so all briefings had to be given verbally. 'I left because of the lack of pay and because I was being messed about. It wasn\u2019t well organised.' Rushed to hospital: Suzanne had been studying at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge and living with her father David, mother Wendy and older brother Stuart when she died . Recalling the night, he said: 'I believed everyone had been karting before and was confident in what they were doing. Andy was the man in charge.' Cambridgeshire Raceway Volunteer manager Paul Shinn, who was Mr Kivlin's boss, told the inquest he had trusted him not to let people on the track out-of-hours. He said: 'Helmets are compulsory and . neck braces are optional to those over 16. Customers have to sign a . disclaimer before using the kart. 'If . you have a scarf on, you take it off. They would be told at reception, . at the briefing and if they still had it, I would take it off.' Mr Shinn described getting a phone call from Mr Kivlin on the night of Suzanne\u2019s death. He told the hearing: 'Andy told me he had f***** up. Andy sounded upset but not hysterical. 'I . rang Phil [the owner] and left a message with his wife. Phil spoke with . Andy on the phone. Phil told me we did not need to attend and I went . home. 'Andy did not have permission to have anybody on the course after hours. I have never known it to happen before.' He added: 'The only authority Andy had was over the track as a marshall when I was there and that is it. 'I remember saying to him you know you have lost your job. I was more gutted that I trusted him.' Suzanne, . from Hardwick, near Cambridge, was rushed to hospital after her scarf . got caught in the rear axle of her go-kart on December 11, 2009. Huntingdon Law Courts heard William Hitchcock called for an ambulance, but Mr Kivlin told him to cancel it. William said: 'Andy said stop calling them, I will take her in the car myself. I told the ambulance it was not needed. 'I think he was panicked about the situation and he did not want to get into any trouble. She had started to come round. 'I decided to call back. Suzi was getting clearly worse.' She died the next day in Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital. A post mortem carried out by Home Office Pathologist Dr Benjamin Swift recorded the medical cause of death as ligature strangulation. Suzanne was studying at Long Road Sixth Form College in Cambridge and lived with her father David, mother Wendy and older brother Stuart. South Cambridgeshire District Council has been given until the end of October to complete a health and safety report into the incident. The inquest also heard staff at Cambridgeshire Raceway were paid a \u00a340 day rate cash-in-hand, but Coroner Morris ruled the running of the company was not a matter for the inquest. The inquest, which is expected to conclude tomorrow, was expected to hear from Suzanne\u2019s brother Stuart this afternoon.

Exercising vigorously for just ten minutes twice a week is enough to help middle-aged women avoid heart disease, a study has found. Women who did strenuous activity two to three times a week \u2013 enough to cause sweating or a fast heartbeat \u2013 were 20 per cent less likely to suffer from heart problems, stroke and blood clots than inactive women, researchers said. Those who did gentler exercise, such as walking, gardening or cycling, four to six times a week had the same reduction in their risk of heart disease. Indeed, doing any physical activity at all was found to lower risk by a certain amount, compared with being inactive. But surprisingly, getting active more than three times a week did not result in a further drop in risk. The chance of heart disease was no lower among the small proportion of women who did some strenuous activity more than three times a week than among those who did so two to three times. The Oxford University research, which is published in the journal Circulation, is based on data from more than a million UK women who took part in the Million Women Study, a major health project that was started in 1996. The latest analysis was funded by the British Heart Foundation, the Medical Research Council and Cancer Research UK. Lead author Dr Miranda Armstrong, a physical activity epidemiologist, said: \u2018Inactive middle-aged women should try to do some activity regularly. \u2018Positively, the research showed that every effort to be physically active could contribute to improving heart health. Women who were active two to three times a week were able to cut the risk of heart disease substantially.\u2019 The finding comes during the British Heart Foundation\u2019s Heart Month, when the charity is urging people to spend ten minutes each day making small lifestyle changes to improve their heart health. Doireann Maddock, senior cardiac nurse at the BHF, said: \u2018This research reinforces evidence that you don\u2019t have to run marathons or spend hours at the gym to improve your heart health. Exercising vigorously for just ten minutes twice a week is enough to help middle-aged women avoid heart disease . \u2018Even if you don\u2019t have much time to spare, just a couple of weekly sessions to get your heart rate going can help to reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke.\u2019 Tom Stansfeld, of Cancer Research UK, commented: \u2018This study shows how important physical activity is for your health \u2013 and it\u2019s not only your heart that stands to benefit. \u2018Even small amounts of physical activity can reduce the risk of breast, bowel and womb cancers. \u2018Being active in any way you can \u2013 even if it\u2019s just walking to the station or getting off the bus a few stops earlier \u2013 is a great thing for your overall health.\u2019 Britons are advised to do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate activity. But almost a third get less than 30 minutes of exercise a week, and one in ten does not manage to walk for more than five minutes at a time over a month. A can of sugary drink a day increases your risk of dying from heart disease by a third, health campaigners warn. They have unveiled a poster campaign to highlight the risks of drinks such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi, which they say are linked to tooth decay and type 2 diabetes, while a can a day could lead to weight gain of over a stone in a year. The campaign, called GULP \u2013 Give Up Loving Pop \u2013 comes from the Health Equalities Group, based in Liverpool and funded by the NHS and local authorities. Director Robin Ireland said: \u2018Few people fully realise the harm that sugary drinks can do to your health. . . We\u2019ve launched our GULP campaign to get the message across and take the fight to the manufacturers.\u2019 Soft drinks are now the largest single source of sugar for teens and children aged four to ten. Many groups want a tax on the drinks to reduce consumption and fund health schemes. Recent research by the University of Liverpool suggests a 20p per litre tax in London alone could prevent 1,100 cancers, 6,300 cases of type 2 diabetes, and cut the number with heart disease and strokes by 4,300. Such a levy would add around 7p to the price of a standard can.

Tests carried out on drugs which were seized during the summer show a huge rise in the amount of MDMA contained in the party drug. In one case, the government warned one batch had been tested to have about two-and-a-half times the standard MDMA dose - the active ingredient in ecstasy - per pill. Scroll down for video . Tests carried out on drugs which were seized this summer show the purity of ecstasy is at its highest level for ten years (stock image) It comes after the number of deaths caused by ecstasy soared from eight in 2010 up to 43 in 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics. The perceived rise in purity has prompted the Warehouse Project in Manchester (WHP), one of the biggest clubs in the country, to warn revellers about the dangers of increased purity before they visit the venue. Sacha Lord, director of WHP, said the concern was that those who are used to taking two or three tablets of a lower purity will continue to do so, potentially sparking fatal consequences. While the club says it does not condone drug-taking, it has started warning about 'very high purity' drugs in circulation on its Twitter feed. Nick Bonnie, 30, died after unknowingly taking almost 15 times the recreational dose of MDMA before visiting the Warehouse Project, Manchester . Mr Lord told the\u00a0Guardian: 'I would much rather warn people that the quality is that high and that it could cause all these issues if you take too much.' Fiona Measham, professor of criminology at Durham University, who regularly tests drugs, says the average ecstasy tablet now contains 100mg of MDMA. In 2009 the average ecstasy pill contained just 20-30mg. An 'acceptable' dose for an average-sized adult during one drug-taking session is 70-75mg, she says. Ms Measham said the increased purity of ecstasy was probably due to manufacturers developing new ways to synthesise the drug. Last year, WHP started warning customers of the dangers of PMA, a potentially lethal drug often sold under the banner of MDMA. Though no clubbers have been taken to hospital since the start of the season in September, about four of the 2,000 punters who attend each night end up being treated by on-site paramedics, mostly for drug-related issues. In an inquest earlier this month, the court heard how Prince's Trust worker Nick Bonnie, 30, died from ecstasy and cocaine poisoning. He unknowingly took almost 15 times the recreational dose of MDMA before entering the club, the coroner ruled. Tests showed a concentration of 4.42mg of MDMA in his blood. Typical recreational use normally measuring just 0.3mg. Anne-Marie Cockburn has called for a change to UK drug policy, after her daughter Martha Fernback died from taking a ecstasy tablet which was 91 per cent pure. The average is around 58 per cent . Earlier this year, Anne-Marie Cockburn, the mother of 15-year-old Martha Fernback, who died in 2013, called for drugs to be legalised. Martha, from Oxford, had consumed a dose which was 91 per cent pure. The average street purity is 58 per cent. Speaking after the inquest into her daughter's death, Miss Cockburn said: 'We need strict and responsible regulation. The Warehouse Project in Manchester (pictured) has started warning clubbers about the increased purity of ecstasy tablets . 'I'm not a radical person, this has been well considered and thought out. If we had that, Martha would have been able to make an informed decision. 'Martha wanted to get high, she didn't want to die - no parent wants either, but one of those is preferable to the other.' Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter recorded a conclusion of accidental death at the inquest at County Hall in Oxford. He said: 'It is a terrible loss and I think we can only say that it may at least serve as a warning to young people who may take, or think of taking, ecstasy or MDMA. 'What is clear is that there is no way of knowing what it is made up of or what the purity level is.

Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers is fourth at just under $47million. Tiger Woods is fifth with $40.8million, his lowest spot since SI started the list in 2004. He was No. 1 through 2011. Woods, who is coming off a big win at the Player's Championship this weekend, is beginning to find his stride after battling injury and very public battle with a cheating scandal. But his overall value continues to decline, most likely due to the loss of several endorsement deals following the appearance of numerous mistresses across the country. Right behind Woods was fellow golfer Phil Mickelson, who is expected to earn just under $40million this year. Slipping: Tiger Woods was in fifth place on the list, his lowest spot since the rankings began in 2004. Until 2011, Woods was No. 1 each year . Next on the leaderboard: Right behind Woods was fellow golfer Phil Mickelson, who is expected to earn just under $40million this year . Injured, but making money: Alex Rodriguez, left, has not played all season but still made the top 10. Zach Greinke, right, broke his collarbone during a bench-clearing brawl after making just two starts in 2013 . Rounding out the top 10 are New York . Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Zach . Greinke, whose 2013 seasons have been marred by injuries. A-Rod has sat out the season so far while recovering from hip surgery, and is eying a return to baseball in mid-July. Greinke broke his collarbone in a bench-clearing brawl in April after making just two starts - and is expected to pitch tonight. Conspicuously absent from the list is Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco, who signed a six-year mega-deal in March that's worth $120.6million - making him the highest paid NFL player. Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco, who signed a $120.6million mega-deal in March, does not appear on the list despite being the highest paid athlete in the NFL - because . But Sports Illustrated left out players who signed big contracts after their respective seasons had ended. The top 50 include 25 baseball players, 13 basketball players and eight football players, with no female athletes for the fifth consecutive year. Only one athlete came from the sport of auto racing - Dale Earnhardt Jr. The team with the best representation is the Yankees, with five total players. The estimates combine salary, winnings and endorsements.

Star arrival: Jude Law was rushed into the Old Bailey to give evidence for the prosecution at the hacking trial in January . Jude Law was betrayed by a relative who sold information about his girlfriend\u2019s affair with Daniel Craig, a court heard yesterday. It was only during yesterday\u2019s proceedings that Law learned that the immediate family member was paid by the News of the World for details of the actor\u2019s showdown with the James Bond star after Craig\u2019s fling with Sienna Miller. In a dramatic moment at the Old Bailey, Law, 41, was handed a folded piece of paper containing the relative\u2019s name and was asked if he knew they had spoken to the newspaper in 2005. His voice cracked slightly as he said he had come to know about it several years later, but had not known they had been paid. \u2018I\u2019m confused about what you are saying,\u2019 he told Timothy Langdale, the QC defending former News of the World editor Andy Coulson in the phone hackling trial. \u2018Are you asking whether I was aware of people being paid to get information? I wasn\u2019t aware of it.\u2019 Asked when he first heard his relative had taken money from the tabloid, he replied: \u2018Today.\u2019 The father of four appeared shaken as he was asked if he knew that his relative and others around him were paid to talk to the tabloid. The relative was said to have sold details about Law\u2019s phone call to Craig, after he discovered the 007 actor\u2019s affair with his then girlfriend Miss Miller. In an angry transatlantic call, Law was said to have berated Craig and demanded he should tell his own girlfriend, film producer Satsuki Mitchell, about his infidelity. Law said he had known Craig for \u2018many, many years\u2019 before he learned of the affair, which was made public a month after the phone call in a News of the World front page headlined \u2018Sienna cheats on Jude\u2019. In an awkward courtroom exchange, he agreed he had called his fellow actor about the fling in 2005.Mr Langdale said: \u2018I\u2019m not going to ask you the detail but no doubt you expressed your view of his behaviour?\u2019 Scroll down for video .

Affair: The Old Bailey heard that Daniel Craig and Sienna Miller, pictured together in Layer Cake, had a relationship and Jude Law called the James Bond star after he found out . Jude Law was asked about how the 2005 affair between Sienna Miller and Daniel Craig was revealed in the News of the World and if he knew a family member was secretly selling stories about him. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC (AE) to Jude Law (JL): 'When was the first time that you heard the suggestion that a member of your family had passed information to the News of the World for money?' JL: 'Today.' AE: 'Can you tell me when it was discovered a relative had been in conversation with the News of the World about this story?. JL: 'That was in the autumn of last year, Initially it was from the (hacking) investigation, and when - confronted is too strong a word - a conversation was had with the relative they came up and admitted it had gone on. 'Admitted is maybe too strong a word, but I had never heard any money had been exchanged until today.' Timothy Langdale QC, (TL) defending Andy Coulson, asked Mr Law whether he knew about the affair in September 2005. TL: 'Were you aware there had been or was some sort of relationship between them?' JL: 'Yes, in and around that time, indeed I was.' TL: 'Did you telephone Daniel Craig and speak to him about it, at a time when he was in Baltimore? JL: 'Yes' TL: 'No doubt you expressed your view of his behaviour?\u00a0 Did you make any reference to his then-girlfriend, somebody called Satsuki?' JL: 'I did, yeah. I do not remember if that was her name - Saski - more than likely, yes. We had known each other for many, many years, so the conversation took on all sorts of turns.' TL: 'You were not aware that a member of your immediate family was talking to the press, to the News of the World, about this story?'. JL: 'No I was not aware of that'. Mr Law was then handed a written note of the family member's name. AE: 'It was been suggested part of the tale of the phone call . to Daniel Craig came from sources close to you. Did you authorise that . exercise?'

Frost. He said Miss Miller had been the one to tell him that one of his . entourage, a male employee, had been giving information about them to . the News of the World.

He said: \u2018When a conversation was had . with the relative, they came and admitted what had gone on. \u2018But as I said before, I had never heard any money had been exchanged until today.\u2019 The . family member was not named in court and their identity was only . revealed to two barristers and the judge. Mr Langdale said the . relative\u2019s identity should be protected because they were a confidential . journalistic source. A second piece of paper was also handed to Law, . containing the names of a publicist and the male employee who were said . to have been selling stories to the tabloid. He confirmed both names, . but added: \u2018I was never aware that any money had changed hands.\u2019 Law . said Press interest in his private life had increased dramatically . after his Oscar nomination for The Talented Mr Ripley in 2001 and the . subsequent breakdown of his marriage to Miss Frost.

An advance copy of the report, which is circulating among Security Council members, was obtained by CNN ahead of a Wednesday briefing on Syria to the council by Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan. The document outlines the efforts to implement a six-point plan that would impose a cease-fire and take measures to protect human rights, and admits that it has not worked. In some places, the levels of violence are even higher today than they were before an initial cease-fire attempt, the report says. Military: Shelling from Syria hits Lebanon . The 300-strong U.N. team in Syria, whose mission is to observe and help implement the plan, has been unable to do its work as envisioned because of present conditions, the document states. Last month, the United Nations announced that it was pulling back its unarmed monitors because of escalating violence. Opposition groups slammed the international body for the suspension of its work. The U.N. mission's role in Syria was based on the premise that there would be a cessation to the violence, and failing that, \"a calibration of effort in response to the situation on the ground would be appropriate,\" Ban writes. Basically, the three options Ban puts on the table are: withdrawing the U.N. team, increasing its size or adding armed protection for them; or retooling the mission of the current team. Ban elaborates the most on the idea to shift the strategy of the current U.N. team. The team could retain its military observer capability and continue its fact-finding work, but with a limited scope in light of the violence in Syria, the report says. In this scenario, the U.N. mission would move its personnel from the field back to Damascus, where it would focus on pushing forward the six-point plan to the Syrian government and the opposition. \"From a central hub in Damascus, the civilian component would continue liaison and dialogue with opposition and Government representatives in the provinces as security conditions allow,\" Ban writes. The other options -- withdrawal or augmentation of the force -- could have more negative consequences than good, the report concludes. Photos: In Syrian hospital, no escape from war . Withdrawing from Syria would ensure the safety of the team, but it could signal a loss of confidence in the hopes of a cease-fire and leave the U.N. without a way to monitor progress, the report says. \"(Withdrawing) would likely precipitate a further blow to efforts to stabilize the situation on the ground, and render the prospect of a negotiated Syrian-led transition, as laid out by the Action Group, more difficult,\" Ban writes. Expanding the size of the mission, with or without armed protection, poses an \"unacceptably high\" security risk, given that there are no signs of the violence receding immediately, the report says. These options must be considered, Ban writes, because \"in spite of the best efforts of (the mission) to support the parties in the effort to de-escalate the crisis, there is not a cessation of violence, and the basic human rights whose protection is at the core of the (six-point) plan continue to be violated,\" the report says. According to the opposition Local Coordination Committees in Syria, 71 people, including 10 defectors, were killed across the country. In fighting in Aleppo Province since Friday, four Syrian troops and one opposition fighter were killed, another group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Heavy fighting was reported in Idlib, where the town of Al-Tamani'a was shelled by forces who tried to raid it, the group said. Shelling was reported in several suburbs of Damascus. The state-run SANA news agency reported at least four different incidents where \"terrorist\" attacks were foiled by security forces throughout the country. According to the agency, more than 11 fighters it identified as \"terrorists\" were killed by security forces, and at least 10 vehicles, some with weapons inside, were destroyed. CNN cannot independently verify government and opposition claims of casualties because access to Syria by international journalists has been severely curtailed.

The blasts included 14 car bombs, two roadside bombs and mortar attacks in at least 17 neighborhoods of the capital, most of them in Shiite neighborhoods, police said. In an earlier report, police said there had been three roadside bombs and a sticky bomb: a device typically placed on a vehicle. Explosions struck the Shiite neighborhoods of Kadhimiya in the northwest; Amil, Bayaa and Shulaa in the southwest; Ur and Zuhour in the northeast; Sadr City, Kamaliya and Amin in the east; and Abu Dhsir in the southern part of the city. Other blasts struck mixed Sunni-Shiite neighborhoods, including Waziriya, Yarmouk, Jihad and Eghraiat. \"We are aware of multiple explosions in the Baghdad area with resultant casualties,\" the U.S. military said in response to a query from CNN. \"At this time, no request for [U.S. Forces - Iraq] support has been made but we are providing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance coverage over some of the explosion sites.\" A U.S. military spokesman, Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, said the strikes are typical of al Qaeda in Iraq attacks. During the height of the Iraq war, sectarian violence tore through Baghdad on a daily basis in Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods. Also Tuesday, the Committee to Protect Journalists protested Iraq's move -- carried out Monday -- to close Al-Baghdadiya TV's offices in Baghdad and Basra. The decision came after the Cairo, Egypt-based satellite channel broadcast demands of gunmen who attacked a church in Baghdad on Sunday. The hours-long standoff ended after Iraqi security forces stormed the Sayidat al-Nejat church. In all, 58 people died, and 75 others were wounded; most of the casualties were women and children, the officials added. The Al-Baghdadiya bureau chief in Cairo, Abdelhamid al-Saih, told the journalists group that the shutdown was illegal since there was no judicial order and that he believed authorities were using the broadcast as a pretext to close the offices because the channel had previously given Iraqis the opportunity to criticize the government. \"We are concerned by the closure of Al-Baghdadiya TV and demand that [the government's Communications and Media Commission] explain under what authority it has stormed the station's offices and censored it,\" said Mohamed Abdel Dayem, Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. \"We call on the authorities to allow the station to resume its operations immediately.\" According to the committee, the government commission said in a statement that the attackers had \"contacted the station and selected it to be the exclusive platform for their inhumane practices with the purpose of disrupting Iraq's national unity and to inflame religious discord.\" It said, \"the station's broadcast of demands 'amounts to incitement to violence' and that Al-Baghdadia's coverage was not objective, creating a threat to the military operation by providing attackers with information about ongoing operations to rescue the hostages.\" CNN's Arwa Damon contributed to this report."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Baghdad experienced 14 car bombs and two roadside bombs, leading to 63 fatalities and 285 wounded.

As politicians and cable news pundits spent the 16-day shutdown of . the federal government describing the apocalyptic scenario of the shutdown, the vast majority of ordinary citizens weren't . even phased by the fed being closed for business, according to a new survey. The Washington Post/ABC News survey, released Tuesday, finds that . 78-percent of those polled say they were not inconvenienced by the . shutdown at all. Of the 22-percent who said they were inconvenienced, 11-percent described their troubles as a 'minor inconvenience.' Barely missed: Only 11 percent of Americans say they were majorly inconvenienced by government shutdown . The survey was conducted October 17 through the 20th - after the shutdown had come to an end. The surveyors polled 1,002 adults, asking the question 'Were you . personally inconvenienced by the partial shutdown of the federal . government or not?' If a respondent answered yes, they were asked the followup question of 'was it a major inconvenience or a minor inconvenience?' Prior to the shutdown, the Associated Press explained how it would effect regular people, noting that it would have far-reaching consequences for some, but minimal impact on others. Deal: a deal to re-open the government was achieved on October 17 . AIR TRAVEL . Federal air traffic controllers would remain on the job and airport-screening staff would keep funneling passengers through security checkpoints. Federal inspectors would continue enforcing safety rules. Shutdown: The tourist trips to Alcatraz would stop running if the federal shutdown goes ahead on Monday . INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL . The . State Department would continue processing foreign applications for . visas and U.S. applications for passports, since fees are collected to . finance those services. Embassies and consulates overseas would continue . to provide services to American citizens. BENEFIT PAYMENTS . Social Security and Medicare benefits would keep coming, but there could be delays in processing new disability applications. Unemployment benefits would still go out. FEDERAL COURTS . Federal courts would continue operating normally for about 10 business days after the start of a shutdown, roughly until the middle of October. If the shutdown continues, the judiciary would have to begin furloughs of employees whose work is not considered essential. But cases would continue to be heard. MAIL . Deliveries would continue as usual because the U.S. Postal Service receives no tax dollars for day-to-day operations. It relies on income from stamps and other postal fees to keep running. Lunch is served: School students who qualify for free school lunches and breakfast will not go hungry even if the shutdown goes ahead this week . RECREATION . All national parks would be closed, as would the Smithsonian museums, including the National Zoo in Washington. Visitors using overnight campgrounds or other park facilities would be given 48 hours to make alternate arrangements and leave the park. Among the visitor centers that would be closed: the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island in New York, Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Alcatraz Island near San Francisco and the Washington Monument. HEALTH . New patients would not be accepted into clinical research at the National Institutes of Health, but current patients would continue to receive care. Medical research at the NIH would be disrupted and some studies would be delayed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be severely limited in spotting or investigating disease outbreaks, from flu to that mysterious MERS virus from the Middle East. FOOD SAFETY . The Food and Drug Administration would handle high-risk recalls suspend most routine safety inspections. Federal meat inspections would be expected to proceed as usual. HEAD START . A small number of Head Start programs, about 20 out of 1,600 nationally, would feel the impact right away. The federal Administration for Children and Families says grants expiring about Oct. 1 would not be renewed. Over time more programs would be affected. Several of the Head Start programs that would immediately feel the pinch are in Florida. It's unclear if they would continue serving children. Safety first: Airport-screening staff will remain at work during the shutdown with safety being a top priority . FOOD ASSISTANCE . The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, could shut down. The program provides supplemental food, health care referrals and nutrition education for pregnant women, mothers and their children. School lunches and breakfasts would continue to be served, and food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would continue to be distributed. But several smaller feeding programs would not have the money to operate. TAXES . Americans would still have to pay their taxes and file federal tax returns, but the Internal Revenue Service says it would suspend all audits. Got questions? Sorry, the IRS says taxpayer services, including toll-free help lines, would be shut as well. LOANS . Many low-to-moderate incomes borrowers and first-time homebuyers seeking government-backed mortgages could face delays during the shutdown. The Federal Housing Administration, which guarantees about 30 percent of home mortgages, wouldn't underwrite or approve any new loans during the shutdown. Action on government-backed loans to small businesses would be suspended. SCIENCE . NASA will continue to keep workers at Mission Control in Houston and elsewhere to support the International Space station, where two Americans and four others are deployed. The National Weather Service would keep forecasting weather and issuing warnings and the National Hurricane Center would continue to track storms. The scientific work of the U.S. Geological Survey would be halted. HOMELAND SECURITY . The majority of the Department of Homeland Security's employees are expected to stay on the job, including uniformed agents and officers at the country's borders and ports of entry, members of the Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration officers, Secret Service personnel and other law enforcement agents and officers. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services employees would continue to process green card applications. MILITARY . The military's 1.4 million active duty personnel would stay on duty, but their paychecks would be delayed. About half of the Defense Department's civilian employees would be furloughed. PRISONS . All 116 federal prisons would remain open, and criminal litigation would proceed. VETERANS SERVICES . Most services offered through the Department of Veterans Affairs will continue because lawmakers approve money one year in advance for the VA's health programs. Veterans would still be able to visit hospitals for inpatient care, get mental health counseling at vet centers or get prescriptions filled at VA health clinics. Operators would still staff the crisis hotline and claims workers would still process payments to cover disability and pension benefits. But those veterans appealing the denial of disability benefits to the Board of Veterans Appeals will have to wait longer for a decision because the board would not issue any decisions during a shutdown. WORK SAFETY . Federal occupational safety and health inspectors would stop workplace inspections except in cases of imminent danger. Cultural abyss: The National Museum of Natural History at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. would be one of many to close during a shutdown . The deal to re-open the government was reached on October 17. However, it is only temporary, and there potentially could be another government shutdown in coming months ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Post the federal shutdown, a survey found 78% of respondents unaffected, 22% inconvenienced, half of which was minor.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\n(CNN) -- Scientists said Wednesday that they had discovered a new particle whose characteristics match those of the Higgs boson, the most sought-after particle in physics, which could help unlock some of the universe's deepest secrets. \"We have reached a milestone in our understanding of nature,\" said Rolf Heuer, the director general of the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which has been carrying out experiments in search of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's largest particle accelerator. \"The discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson opens the way to more detailed studies, requiring larger statistics, which will pin down the new particle's properties, and is likely to shed light on other mysteries of our universe,\" Heuer said. The particle has been so difficult to pin down that the physicist Leon Lederman reportedly wanted to call his book \"The Goddamn Particle.\" But he truncated that epithet to \"The God Particle,\" which may have helped elevate the particle's allure in popular culture. More: Why the 'God Particle' may be key to universe . Announcements by scientists about their analysis of data generated by trillions of particle collisions in the LHC, which is located beneath the Alps, drew avid applause at an eagerly awaited seminar in Geneva, Switzerland, on Wednesday. Finding the Higgs boson would help explain the origin of mass, one of the open questions in physicists' current understanding of the way the universe works. The researchers stressed the preliminary nature of the results they were announcing Wednesday. \"A more complete picture of today's observations will emerge later this year after the LHC provides the experiments with more data,\" the nuclear research organization, known as CERN, said in its statement. But despite the words of caution, the scientists' mood and many of their comments were brimming with enthusiasm about the potential scope of what they had discovered. \"It's hard not to get excited by these results,\" said Sergio Bertolucci, the research director at CERN. The announcements by the CERN researchers come two days after scientists in Illinois said they had crept closer to proving the existence of the Higgs boson but had been unable to reach a definitive conclusion. The U.S.-based scientists outlined their final analysis based on more than 10 years of research and 500 trillion particle collisions using the U.S. Department of Energy's Fermilab Tevatron collider near Batavia, Illinois, whose budgetary woes shut it down last year. Fabiola Gianotti: The woman at the leading edge of physics . They passed the baton onto their counterparts using the LHC, which is much more powerful than the Tevatron. Located 328 feet underneath the border of France and Switzerland, the LHC cost $10 billion and has been sending particles smashing together in 17-mile tunnel for the past 18 months. High speed proton collisions generate a range of even smaller particles that scientists have been sifting through in search of a signal in the data suggesting the existence of the Higgs boson. The elusive particle is part of a theory first proposed by physicist Peter Higgs and others in the 1960s to explain how particles obtain mass. Higgs boson is like... a Justin Bieber fan? The theory proposes that a so-called Higgs energy field exists everywhere in the universe. As particles zoom around in this field, they interact with and attract Higgs bosons, which cluster around the particles in varying numbers. Imagine the universe like a party. Relatively unknown guests at the party can pass quickly through the room unnoticed; more popular guests will attract groups of people (the Higgs bosons) who will then slow their movement through the room. The speed of particles moving through the Higgs field works much in the same way. Certain particles will attract larger clusters of Higgs bosons -- and the more Higgs bosons a particle attracts, the greater its mass will be. While finding the Higgs boson won't tell us everything we need to know about how the universe works, it will fill in a huge hole in the Standard Model that has existed for more than 50 years, according to experts. \"The Higgs boson is the last missing piece of our current understanding of the most fundamental nature of the universe,\" Martin Archer, a physicist at Imperial College in London, told CNN.

Manchester City will face Barcelona in the last 16 of the European Champions League in what promises to be one of the most eagerly awaited contests in this year's competition. City, which has been in irrepressible form at home in the English Premier League and won at defending champion Bayern Munich last week, had failed to reach this stage in each of its previous two attempts. Now it will face a Barcelona side which has won the tournament on four occasions -- but director of football Txixi Beguiristain says City will not fear his former club. \"I think it will be a great match,\" he told City's official website. \"Ours is a team with a lot of confidence especially after winning against the champions in Munich -- that will give us a lot of confidence. Not just at home but away as well. \"We have to be confident because of the way we are playing. We are showing that we can score in all matches. This is important in the Champions League. \"We scored in Plzen, in Moscow, in Munich -- it should give us confidence to play against a team who have been champions many times. \"Our manager knows Barcelona perfectly because he managed in Spain for a long time. In this sense, we are confident. \"I think the text messages will be flying between Manchester and Barcelona now between Sergio and Lionel! If you want to win the Champions League you have to beat the biggest teams, Barcelona are one of the biggest teams.\" City has spent the past few years modeling itself on Barcelona -- now it is aiming to supplant it in Europe's top club competition. Under the management of Manuel Pellegrini, the former Villarreal and Real Madrid coach, City has progressed to the last 16 of the competition for the very first time. Backed by the riches of Sheikh Mansour, the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, City has used its financial muscle to lure those who enjoyed great success at Barcelona. Beguiristain worked at the Camp Nou from 2003-10 before joining City to work alongside Ferran Soriano, who joined following a spell with the Catalan club as vice-president. Only last January, Barcelona president Sandro Rosell accused City of trying to poach players and coaching staff from the Camp Nou. One former Barcelona player who is expected to star for City is Yaya Toure -- the midfielder who left for England in July 2010. The contest will also see City's Argentine striker Sergio Aguero, who will hope to have recovered from a calf injury after being ruled out for up to a month, go up against international teammate Lionel Messi. And while neutrals will be salivating at the prospect of the two heavyweight giants going head-to-head, Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino says both teams would have rather avoided one another. \"City will not have wanted to play against Barcelona either,\" he told reporters. \"What we need to concentrate on is being in good shape when February comes around. We need to have a high level and sustain it. \"They are scoring goals with ease so we are not going to discover them now. We want to play well in the tie and obviously win it.\" Elsewhere, defending champion Bayern Munich will take on Arsenal in a repeat of last season's clash at the same stage. Bayern triumphed 3-1 in north London before squeaking through to the quarterfinals on away goals following a 2-0 home defeat. Arsenal, which sits top of the Premier League despite Saturday's 6-3 defeat at Manchester City, will provide a tough test for Bayern, according to chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. \"They are the leaders in the Premier League and so we have been warned,\" he told reporters. \"A few months ago we lost to them in Munich. They are a very tough team.\" In 2012, Didier Drogba struck the winning penalty as Chelsea pulled off an unlikely Champions League triumph by defeating Bayern in the final in Munich. Now at Galatasaray, Drogba will return to Stamford Bridge to face his beloved Blues in what promises to be an emotional reunion. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho had predicted that his side would be paired with the Turkish club, which defeated Juventus in a dramatic final group game to seal its place in the last 16. Real Madrid has been paired with German side Schalke, with Carlo Ancelotti's men still harboring ambitions of winning \"La Decima\" -- the club's 10th title. Real, which sits third in Spain, has not won the competition since 2002 and was beaten by Borussia Dortmund in last year's semifinal. Dortmund, which was beaten in last season's final by Bayern, will travel to Russia to take on Zenit St Petersburg in the first leg. Manchester United will be favorite to progress to the quarterfinal stage after being paired with Greek side Olympiakos. David Moyes' side, which finished top of its group despite unconvincing domestic form, last won the competition in 2008. Seven-time winner AC Milan has been handed a testing tie against Atletico Madrid.

He did not give specifics, but asked by Amanpour if there is trafficking of children, Bellerive said, \"The reports I received say yes.\" Haiti is trying to locate displaced children and register them so they can either be reunited with other family members or put up for adoption, Bellerive said. But, he said, illegal child trafficking is \"one of the biggest problems that we have.\" Many groups appear to be legitimate, \"but a lot of organizations -- they come and they say there were children on the streets. They're going to bring them to the [United] States,\" he said. Bellerive said he's trying to work with embassies in Port-au-Prince to protect Haiti's children from traffickers. \"Any child that is leaving the country has to be validated by the embassy under a list that they give me, with all the reports,\" he said. Speaking at his temporary headquarters in a police station near the Port-au-Prince Airport, Bellerive said the first thing Haitian officials seek to confirm is whether the children have adoption papers before they leave the country. In Washington, the State Department said Wednesday it is moving cautiously on the issue of adoptions from Haiti. \"We want to be sure that when a child has been identified, that due diligence has been done to make sure that this is truly an orphan child and not a child that actually has family,\" said State Department Spokesman P.J. Crowley. \"Sometimes if you push too hard, too fast there can be unintended consequences. So we are being very, very careful.\" \"We respect the sovereignty of Haiti and their right to control the departure of Haitian children. So we think the system that has been established is working effectively. I know there is a perception out there of 'cut through the red tape.' But there are very good reasons we want to make sure this process works well,\" Crowley said. On the broader issue of Haitian children, Bellerive told Amanpour the government will reopen schools Monday in most of the country. He said there were particular problems in Port-au-Prince. \"We cannot open one school and not the other. But some of the schools want to operate right now. They say if there are tents -- if there are facilities and we can help them -- they are willing to open very rapidly.\" Bellerive also highlighted the critical importance of getting enough tents and shelters to Haiti before the rainy season begins in May. He said he didn't know where all the tents promised by aid agencies and governments are. \"We have reports that they've already sent 20,000 tents maybe, and 20,000 more are on the way. But yesterday, when we didn't see the tents and we didn't see any action to organize the shelters, the president himself asked to see the storage place and we only counted 3,500 tents.\" Bellerive said President Rene Preval asked for 200,000 tents to house between 400,000 and 500,000 people. \"We are very preoccupied about the consequences of all those people on the street, if it starts to rain.\" The prime minister also rejected criticism from within Haiti and overseas that his government needs to be more visible to the Haitian people. \"We are in charge. Frankly I don't understand what that position is that we are not visible,\" he said. \"I almost feel that I spend more time talking to radio, television, than I am working.\" \"I know it's part of my job and I have to communicate. But I really feel that I have spent too much time doing that.\" Bellerive also said he does not believe it's necessary to relocate the capital to another part of Haiti. \"I have to wait for technical and scientific evaluation, but from what I've heard until now, Port-au-Prince will stay there.\" \"Tokyo is still there, Los Angeles is still there. We just have to prepare a better constructed Port-au-Prince, a safer Port-au-Prince,\" he said. He also acknowledged the need for more transparency and new procedures to prevent corruption in Haiti. But he said 70 to 80 percent of the aid coming to the country right now does not go through the Haitian government. Bellerive said about 90 percent of American aid, for example, goes through non-governmental organizations. \"They are accountable to the American government, but not to the Haitian government,\" he said. The prime minister told Amanpour that he does not believe people overseas are helping Haiti out of a moral obligation. \"I believe it's a more pragmatic responsibility,\" he said. \"I believe Haiti could be an interesting market in the midterm. We are 10 million [people] here and it's a market.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Haiti's PM Bellerive reported child and organ trafficking post-earthquake.

Commuters reacted with fury yesterday after the new rail minister declared that they enjoy \u2018fair fares for comfortable commuting\u2019 \u2013 on the same day they were warned of another inflation-busting rise in ticket prices. Claire Perry, facing accusations of shocking complacency, also insisted that high prices could be avoided by simply booking ahead. Yesterday it was revealed that next year\u2019s increase is likely to be 3.5 per cent and some prices could rise by as much as 5.5 per cent. Fares have already increased by nearly 25 per cent since David Cameron came to power in May 2010. But Miss Perry said: \u2018What we have got to do is to make sure rail passengers \u2013 who could be forgiven for saying: \u201cWhat on earth am I getting for these rises that I\u2019ve seen over the last decade?\u201d \u2013 start to realise they are paying fair fares for comfortable commuting.\u2019 If Miss Perry \u2013 who regularly uses a car to get into work \u2013 takes the train from her constituency of Devizes, Wiltshire, she is able to claim back the cost of a standard class ticket from her nearest station of Pewsey into London. Her comments were met with scorn by commuters yesterday. Phil Guichard, 47, a marketing director, said: \u2018I would like to see the minister on the 07.45 to Paddington. \u2018It\u2019s not comfortable at all. At peak times I\u2019m lucky to get a seat.\u2019 Julie Ward, 47, a nurse from near Maidenhead, said her experience was \u2018horrendous\u2019, but still costs \u00a3240 a month. She said: \u2018I find it unbelievable that they can charge so much and give such awful service. \u2018I\u2019ve actually thought about videoing it and sending it to the minister so she can see what it\u2019s really like. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d call it comfortable then.\u2019 Another commuter, Iain Irvine, 51, said the transport minister needed \u2018a reality check\u2019 if she thought the railways offered good value for money. The company secretary, who gets a 5am train to keep down the \u00a3400 a month cost of his commute from Bristol to Paddington, said: \u2018The only reason I use the trains is because I have no choice. If they want us to pay more they need to improve the services. Commuters wait to squeeze on to the next train to Victoria Station at Clapham Junction, south London . Rail fares will soar by up to 5.5% in January - and by an average of 3.5% - following this morning's announcement that RPI inflation was 2.5% in July . \u2018It\u2019s just not good enough. If the minister thinks they represent value for money she needs a bit of a reality check.\u2019 The annual increase in train fares is linked to July\u2019s inflation figure, published yesterday by the Office for National Statistics, plus one percentage point. With the retail prices index at 2.5 per cent last month, this means rail fares will typically rise by 3.5 per cent in January 2015, although some increases could be even bigger. The Chancellor George Osborne could soften the blow, and he is likely to face growing pressure in the coming months to allow an increase of RPI but no more. But in a BBC interview yesterday, Miss Perry dismissed claims that train fares are cripplingly expensive. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said rail prices would rise by 24 per cent by 2018 . When asked whether it was fair that a London to Manchester ticket can cost \u00a3160, she said this was \u2018only if you don\u2019t book in advance\u2019. In fact, the popular Trainline website yesterday showed a day return ticket before 9am to Manchester Piccadilly costs \u00a3164 to travel today. If booked a fortnight in advance, it is only \u00a323 cheaper to travel at the same times. Questioned on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme yesterday, she insisted: \u2018People don\u2019t just rock up to the station, like probably you and I do, and pay the maximum amount.\u2019 The proposed increases are particularly painful because workers have faced six years of pay freezes, minimal rises or even cuts in wages. For example, the cost of a season ticket to London for commuters from Brighton is expected to jump by around \u00a3150 a year to around \u00a34,455, according to the Campaign for Better Transport. This is the pressure group\u2019s estimate of what the cost will be \u2013 although the rail operating companies have not yet published next year\u2019s fares. Martin Abrams of the Campaign for Better Transport said: \u2018If your ticket price is rising four times faster than your salary, or you\u2019re a part-time worker with no choice but to pay for a full-time fare, or you\u2019re stuck with creaking 30-year old diesel trains, or even if you\u2019d just like a seat in return for your \u00a35,000 season ticket, then your fare will seem anything but fair and comfortable.\u2019 Mary Creagh, Labour\u2019s transport spokesman, said: \u2018This is shocking complacency from yet another out-of-touch Tory. Many passengers facing inflation-busting fare rises don\u2019t even get a seat on their train to work, let alone \u201ccomfortable commuting\u201d. \u2018When you go through that every single day, the experience is not a good one.\u2019 Last night, the Department for Transport said no decision has been taken about fare rises for 2015, but a spokesman added that the department was \u2018looking closely at the cost of travel as part of our ongoing commitment to help hard-working people\u2019."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Claire Perry, the rail minister, faced backlash from commuters after suggesting 'fair fares for comfortable commuting' on the day of a ticket price hike announcement.

The first animation shows a Delta Air Lines Boeing 757 and a United Airlines Airbus A320 coming within 230 feet of colliding on the runway at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida in July. The re-creation was based on radar and flight data recorder information from the planes involved.

The second animation shows a May incident at San Francisco International Airport in California in which a Republic Airlines jet takes off, coming within 35 feet of a SkyWest Airlines commuter turboprop that has just landed.

The videos were shown Thursday during the NTSB's annual \"most wanted transportation safety improvements\" board meeting, where the agency reviews its greatest concerns in transportation safety. The Federal Aviation Administration reported that serious runway incursions were reduced by 25 percent in 2007, but the NTSB said much work remains on runway safety and systems to notify pilots when they are about to collide with another plane or vehicle. NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker expressed frustration with the slow progress of implementing new technology, such as the use of a global positioning system-type procedure in cockpits that would help warn pilots of dangers on the runway. Rosenker told the NTSB-only panel, \"It is time to do something before we have to investigate an accident that is catastrophic.\" Among the most wanted transportation safety improvements cited on the NTSB's Web site are items to \"stop runway incursions/ground collisions of aircraft\" with the notations \"action needed by Federal Aviation Administration\" and \"unacceptable response.\" The site says systems the FAA has added to airports to warn air traffic controllers of potential collisions aren't \"sufficient.\" \"In recent incidents, [one system] did not alert controllers in time to be effective, and the situations were instead resolved by flight crew actions that sometimes bordered on heroics or just plain luck,\" the NTSB site says. \"Until there is a system in place to positively control ground movements of all aircraft, with direct warning to pilots, the potential for this type of disaster will continue to be high.\" Rosenker told Thursday's board gathering that \"this must be resolved.\" \"We've had this recommendation for a number of years -- too many number of years,\" he said.

UPDATED: . 04:40 EST, 12 April 2013 . Congress' most serious gun-control effort in years passed the first step towards legalization on Thursday as the Senate pushed past conservatives' attempted blockade under the teary gaze of families of victims of December's Connecticut school shootings. The bipartisan 68-31 vote rebuffed an effort to keep debate from even starting, giving an early victory - and perhaps political momentum - to President Barack Obama and his gun control allies. Four months after 20 first-graders and six staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown were killed, relatives watching the vote from a gallery overlooking the Senate floor dabbed at tears and clasped hands, some seeming to pray. Scroll down for video . In their honor: Erica Lafferty, the daughter of Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung, and Jillian Soto, the sister of slain teacher Victoria Soto, spoke alongside senators after the new bill passed Congress . Emotional: Jillian Soto was surrounded by other parents and family members who lost relatives in the December 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, many of whom have been pushing for stricter gun laws ever since . Emotional: Many of the Newtown relatives, including Jillian Soto, were present as they have pushed legislators to take action, specifically requiring background checks for all gun sales which was approved today . Even so, few supporters of the legislation are confident of victory. Several weeks of emotional, unpredictable Senate debate lie ahead, and a mix of gun-rights amendments, opposition from the National Rifle Association and skepticism from House Republican leaders leave big questions about what will emerge from Congress. Today the bill passed through the Senate with bi-partisan support. It still needs to be approved by the House of Representatives in Congress before becoming law, but if it is passed it will: . Foes of the proposed new restrictions say they would penalize law-abiding citizens and do nothing to curb gun violence. 'The hard work starts now,' said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the Democrat who brought the legislation to the floor for debate. Still, in a Congress marked by a notable lack of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, Thursday's vote was one of several displays of unusual rapport across party lines. Hoping to bring pressure on Congress to act on gun control, supporters of new restrictions have been demonstrating in Washington. They have erected a mock graveyard with thousands of crosses on the National Mall, symbolizing victims of gun violence. Starting in: Volunteer Martin Witchger begins putting some of the crosses in the lawn of the National Mall early Thursday morning hours before the background check bill passed its first hurdle in Congress . Big numbers: All told, there were 3,300 markers on the Mall as that is the number of people affected by gun violence in the U.S. since December 14, the date of the Newtown shooting . Making an impact: Gun control advocates set up a display of crosses and Stars of David on the National Mall as a mock cemetery to show how many people lose their lives to guns . The Senate's firearms bill would subject . nearly all gun buyers to background checks, add muscle to federal laws by . barring illicit firearm sales and provide slightly more money for school . safety measures. Excluded and facing near-certain defeat in upcoming votes were proposals to ban military-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines - factors in the Newtown killings some other recent mass shootings. But keeping those provisions out of the current legislation did not mollify critics. Opponents said the remaining proposals were unwarranted intrusions on the Second Amendment right to bear arms, would be ignored by criminals and would do little to prevent future Newtowns. Obama's plans have received scant support from Republicans and many moderate Democrats, with many saying they prefer improvements in dealing with the mentally ill and stronger enforcement of existing laws. Hoping for momentum: Lori Haas, a mother who lost a relative to gun violence, is one of the many people who have been pushing for attention to be paid to the Sandy Hook relatives proposals . 'I'm not interested in a symbolic gesture which would offer the families of the Sandy Hook shootings no real solutions that they seek,' said Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate's second-leading Republican. Congress hasn't approved major gun restrictions since enacting an assault weapons ban 19 years ago, a prohibition that lawmakers let lapse after a decade. Some potential amendments could broaden gun rights and weaken supporters' backing for the overall bill. One proposal is by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Mark Begich who say it would improve how the federal background check system blocks weapons from going to people with certain mental problems, though critics say it would make it harder in some cases to do so. Another possible amendment would require states to recognize permits for carrying concealed weapons issued by other states. In Thursday's vote, 50 Democrats and 2 Democratic-leaning independents were joined by 16 Republicans in voting to begin debate on the legislation. Support: Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer from New York has been one of the strongest advocates for pushing through the more strict gun control laws . Proximity: New York's Schumer was joined alongside Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal when he addressed the press and the Newtown relatives . Twenty-nine Republicans and two Democrats facing re-election next year in GOP-leaning states voted 'no' - Alaska's Begich and Mark Pryor of Arkansas. After the roll call, Obama spoke by phone with some Newtown families and said he would 'keep fighting for the votes they deserve,' said White House spokesman Jay Carney. The Senate plans to debate an amendment Tuesday expanding background checks less broadly than the overall legislation would. Broadening the system to cover more transactions is the heart of the current effort on guns. That amendment, a compromise between Republican Senator Patrick Toomey and Democratic Senator Joe Manchin would subject buyers in commercial settings like gun shows and the Internet to the checks but exempt non-commercial transactions like sales between friends and relatives. Reaching out: Democratic Senator Joe Manchin from West Virginia met with Newtown in his office. He was one of the leaders on the background check bill that was approved in Congress today . That accord, unveiled Wednesday, was designed to build bipartisan support for the legislation and seemed likely to do so. Toomey and Manchin are among the most conservative members of their parties and are both gun owners with NRA ratings of A, which is the highest that the gun lobbyist awards. Toomey said Thursday he believes supporters of his compromise with Manchin would be able to beat back any filibuster attempt. 'Beyond that, I just don't know yet,' he said on 'CBS This Morning.' Gun-control . groups have embraced the Manchin-Toomey compromise with varying degrees . of enthusiasm, and they continued to applaud it on Thursday - while . also expressing concerns about some provisions. Possible roadblock: Skepticism from House Republican leaders like House Speaker John Boehner leave big questions about what will emerge from Congress . Besides the exemption for private sales, gun control advocates expressed displeasure with language letting gun dealers sell handguns to out-of-state customers, exempting some holders of permits for concealed weapons from background checks and shielding individuals who sell guns from some negligence lawsuits. 'We are optimistic that this bill will make a dramatic difference in reducing gun violence,' said Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. The NRA said it opposed the Manchin-Toomey compromise and warned senators that it would count votes on provisions it opposes in its evaluation of candidates that it provides its members, who the organization says number nearly 5 million."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Senate passed the first step towards stricter gun-control laws, despite opposition from conservatives and the National Rifle Association.

According to the Times, Obama ordered the cyber attacks sped up, and in 2010 an attack using a computer virus called Stuxnet temporarily disabled 1,000 centrifuges that the Iranians were using to enrich uranium. Congressional leaders demanded a criminal probe into who leaked the information, and Obama said he had zero tolerance for such leaks. Republicans said senior administration officials had leaked the details to bolster the president's national security credentials during the 2012 campaign. U.S. President Barack Obama, pictured during his visit to Senegal, has said he has 'zero tolerance' for security leaks . The Times said Cartwright was one of the crucial players who had to break the news to Obama and Vice President Joe Biden that Stuxnet at one point had escaped onto the Internet. An element of the program accidentally became public in the summer of 2010 because of a programming error that allowed it to escape Iran's Natanz plant and sent it out on the Internet, the Times reported. After the worm escaped onto the Internet, top administration officials met to consider whether the program had been fatally compromised. Obama asked if the program should continue, and after hearing the advice of top advisers, decided to proceed. Cartwright, a four-star general, was cleared in February 2011 of misconduct involving a young aide. An anonymous accuser had claimed Cartwright acted inappropriately during a 2009 overseas trip on which the aide traveled as a military assistant. Several sources confirmed that the former aide was a young woman. The Pentagon inspector general quickly cleared Cartwright of the most serious allegations, which involved claims that he may have had an improper physical relationship with the woman. The report did find that Cartwright mishandled an incident in which the aide, drunk and visibly upset, visited his Tbilisi, Georgia, hotel room alone and either passed out or fell asleep on a bench at the foot of his bed. Cartwright denied any impropriety and was later cleared of all wrongdoing. Cartwright, once considered the leading candidate to become Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, resigned from the military in August 2011. NBC said Cartwright did not respond to request for comment and that his attorney, former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig, said he had no comment.

And he's not the only one. \"We've had interest from Las Vegas. We also had interest from Dubai, Abu Dhabi and the Netherlands,\" Ockels said. The 15 meter-long (50 feet) Superbus is a new spin on public transport that aims to match the speed and comfort of a train while offering the flexibility and convenience of the car. It has a top speed of 250 kph (155 mph) and Ockels envisions it running on a dedicated highway. But it's not just high-speed transport from A to B, Ockels says -- the Superbus can also use normal roads at normal speeds. What's more, it's powered by electricity, which was central to the vision of its chief designer Antonia Terzi. \"What inspired me was the concept that it was a sustainable, new type of transport,\" Terzi said. \"Public transport has to be exciting. You want to say 'well, I have a car but today I'm going to take the Superbus instead,'\" she added. A former Formula One aerodynamicist, Terzi has incorporated hydraulic cylinders in the design so that the car can sit just 7cm off the ground when traveling at high speed, rising to a height of 43cm when it uses normal roads in towns and cities. Rear-wheel steering helps the Superbus achieve a 24-meter turning circle, going easily around a roundabout, says Terzi. After taking a ride earlier this month, 61-year-old Branson commented on his blog that he thinks the Superbus could take on the train business one day, matching it for speed while trumping its convenience by dropping commuters off at their front door. Ockels says he wanted to create something sexy, and something that makes you feel powerful when you are inside, but most of all something that could compete with the car. He hopes to have the vehicle on the roads within five years."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Superbus, an electric vehicle, can reach 250 kph and operate on highways and regular roads.

The world's best football player has been summoned to appear in a Spanish court over tax fraud allegations. Lionel Messi, who plays for Argentina and Barcelona, will appear before a judge on September 17. The four-time World Player of . the Year has been accused of defrauding \u00a33.4million through false income tax returns in Spain. The state prosecutor has taken action against the footballer and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi. Both are accused of three offences against the public purse for allegedly defrauding millions on income tax returns for 2007, 2008 and 2009. The complaint, signed by prosecutor Raquel Amado, was previously submitted for trial at the court in Gava, the upmarket Barcelona suburb where the Argentina forward lives. A judge must accept the prosecutor's lawsuit before charges can be brought against Messi and his father. The footballing star released a statement denying any wrongdoing once the allegations emerged. Reports emerged last week alleging the four-time reigning World Player of the Year and his father, Jorge Horacio, were suspected of filing fraudulent tax returns between 2007 and 2009.

He called the early elections in response to pressure from the opposition Socialist Party, which threatened to block the election of a president in February if there was no general election first. Karamanlis is also seeking a mandate from the voters for reforms in response to the international financial crisis, he said. \"It's up to the citizens to decide who has the right plan to govern and face the economic challenges,\" he said in a speech to the country. \"We have two very difficult and critical years ahead of us,\" he said in the speech on Wednesday. \"There is only one path that offers hope and potential: We take -- without delay, without procrastination -- take all necessary measures to address these problems.

Karamanlis' term was not due to expire until September 2011. But Socialist party leader George Papandreou insisted on new elections before the end of Papoulias' term as president in February. The Greek constitution requires the two major parties to agree on the election of a president, giving either party an effective veto. Karamanlis called Papandreou's stance \"blackmail.\" Parliament will be dissolved on September 7, Karamanlis said on his Web site. Karamanlis' conservative New Democracy party suffered a sharp setback in European elections in June, when the Socialists matched New Democracy's tally of eight seats, with 36 percent of the vote.

A 10-year-old who had to have a kidney transplant after mistakes by doctors at a private hospital left him in renal failure, has today been awarded \u00a34.8 million in compensation. Lucas Tuppeny was born in January 2004 with a bowel defect, and required a colostomy, Judge Richard Parkes heard at London's High Court. A series of errors by medical staff at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital in Kensington, London, resulted in Lucas suffering renal failure. It left the youngster needing dialysis from the age of six months. In October 2005 he received a kidney from his father, Brock, who works in the oil industry. Lucas, who lived in Ruislip, Middlesex, at the time but is now settled with his mother, Therese, in Seattle, in the U.S., has had 28 procedures with a total of 149 days in hospital. And he will need another transplant in the future, the court heard. In spite of his problems, Lucas is an\u00a0'enthusiastic, optimistic, energetic and very sociable little boy', Christopher Johnston QC said. Asked how he was feeling by the judge, Lucas stood and said 'Good, your Lordship', adding he would be having a holiday in the Bahamas before going back to school. The judge, who approved the settlement against the hospital, which admitted liability, said: 'I am delighted to hear it. 'It is lovely to see you and I would just like to wish you all the best for the future. 'You are very lucky in your mum and your dad.' Both the judge and the hospital's counsel, Jeremy Hyam, paid tribute to the outstanding care shown by Lucas's mother. The judge, who had seen a video about Lucas, told Mrs Tuppeny: 'What extraordinary devotion you have lavished on your son throughout these difficult years. 'I don't think anyone on the outside would know what is involved. 'One can only watch with huge respect what you and indeed your former husband have done. 'Having seen the video makes one realise what a splendid young man Lucas is and what potential he has, thanks to you.'

Alison Eddy, a partner with lawyers Irwin Mitchell, said outside court: 'It is a huge relief for his family that the hospital and medical staff who cared for him have now agreed an adequate and fair settlement to cover his care needs both now and in the future. 'This young boy has suffered a catalogue of medical issues throughout his childhood and will face numerous problems in his future as his condition deteriorates.

Investigators believe a $1.5 million life-insurance policy could have been the motive for a savage sledgehammer and knife attack on a New York City psychiatrist last year. Jake Nolan, 21, is accused of unleashing on shrink Michael Weiss, 38, in his Upper West Side office with the heavy weapon and a kitchen knife. But, just four days before the attack, Weiss had reluctantly changed the beneficiary on his hefty insurance policy to Nolan's aunt, fellow psychiatrist Pamela Buchbinder, 43, with whom Weiss shares a young son. Nolan was living with Buchbinder in her Chelsea home at the time of the attack. He is also the Godfather of the pair's child. Crime scene: Jake Nolan, 21, is accused of unleashing on psychiatrist Michael Weiss, 38, in his Upper West Side office, pictured, with the sledgehammer and a kitchen knife . 'The ink was still wet (on the policy) when Nolan attacked him,' Weiss' lawyer, Roland Acevedo, told The New York Post, which has obtained family-court records proving the change in beneficiary. 'It's like a \"20/20\" episode. It sure looks like his son's mother put Jake up to this for the insurance money.' According to the newspaper, the Manhattan district attorney's office is now looking closely at the possible link. Sources told The Post investigators were trying to determine whether Buchbinder was with Nolan when he purchased the sledgehammer from a Manhattan Home Deport store. Weapon: Nolan allegedly swung the sledgehammer at Weiss before stabbing him eight times with the knife (stock photo) They have also quizzed Weiss and requested a copy of the life-insurance policy, a police source said. 'The circumstances are suspicious, and we're looking into it,' the source told The Post. Weiss finally agreed to put Buchbinder's name on his insurance policy on November 8, 2012, after weeks of badgering, Acevedo said. In the morning on November 12, Nolan allegedly arrived at Weiss' midtown Manhattan office carrying a black duffel bag and an argument about paying for the six-year-old boy's education ensued. He then asked to go to the restroom and allegedly came out swinging the sledgehammer over Weiss's head as the psychiatrist hid at his desk. Nolan then pulled out a kitchen knife and proceeded to stab Weiss in his back and chest eight times, police said. The shrink managed to wrestle the knife off Nolan and strike him once before he escaped and begged for help. '(Weiss) crawled into the hallway covered in blood and screamed, \"Help me! Help me!\"' Acevedo said. Nolan was arrested and is now awaiting trial on charges of attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon.

Since April the Chancellor has borrowed more each month than the same time last year, with income and wealth taxes down. The Treasury had been expected to cut borrowing by 12 per cent in 2014-15, but experts said it was 'ever more unlikely' to meet to target. New figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility show borrowing has been higher each month since April than the same time last year . New data from the Office for National Statistics borrowing in September, excluding the effects of bank bail-outs, was \u00a311.8 billion, \u00a31.6 billion ahead of the same month in 2013. It means that halfway through the financial year, the Treasury looks well behind the target for a 12 per cent fall in the annual deficit expected by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Total borrowing for April to September stands at \u00a358 billion, 10 per cent higher than for the same period in 2013-14. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'The Government's current fiscal problems largely reflect the fact that much weaker-than-expected earnings growth has limited income tax receipts, along with a large number of people now being in low-paid jobs or self-employed. The figures are a blow for Chancellor George Osborne who hopes to go into the next election claiming borrowing is down . 'The Chancellor is looking ever more unlikely to meet his fiscal targets for 2014-15.' Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said: 'These figures are a serious blow to George Osborne. 'Not only is he set to break his promise to balance the books by next year, but borrowing in the first half of this year is now 10 per cent higher than the same period last year. 'As the OBR said last week, stagnating wages and too many people in low-paid jobs are leading to more borrowing.' Taxes on income and wealth for September of \u00a313.1 billion were flat on the same month last year and just 0.6 per cent ahead for the year to date. Within this, revenues from income tax and capital gains tax rose 2.2 per cent for the month and 0.1 per cent for the year to date. OBR chairman Robert Chote has warned that the squeeze on pay growth is hitting the Government's revenues from income tax despite record numbers in work. Annual pay growth has been lagging behind inflation since 2008 and latest official figures showed it was just 0.7 per cent. Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said: 'The continued run of poor UK public borrowing figures looks set to severely hamper the Chancellor's ability to announce giveaways to address his party's deficit in the national opinion polls before next year's general election.' The ONS figures suggested that the buoyant property market was continuing to have a positive effect on public finances. Stamp duty on land and property continued to boost the Government's coffers, rising to \u00a31.1 billion for September, matching a high in July that was a seven-year record. Revenues from this were up \u00a31.5 billion, or 34 per cent, to \u00a35.9 billion for the April to September period. The Treasury hoped to cut borrowing to \u00a386.6billion in 2014-15, something which now looks increasingly unlikely . Total receipts were 3.1 per cent ahead to \u00a346 billion, though for the year to date they are 0.4 per cent behind at \u00a3287.1 billion. Spending for September rose by 3.7 per cent from \u00a351.1 billion to \u00a353 billion. Underlying public sector debt was \u00a31.451 trillion, or 79.9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared to 79.2 per cent last month and 77.9 per cent in September last year. A Treasury spokesman said: 'We have seen stronger growth in receipts this month, but as today's figures show, the impact of the great recession is still being felt in our economy and the public finances. 'At the same time, we have to recognise that the UK is not immune to the problems being experienced in Europe and other parts of the world economy.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'It's time for George Osborne to admit he got his strategy wrong. Today's figures show the deficit getting bigger as tax revenues dry up. 'The 90,000 people who marched through the streets of London on Saturday calling for a pay rise understand that it's not just British workers who need wages to go up, but that's what the Treasury and the economy needs too. 'Only a wages-led recovery can bring about the boost in demand that businesses need and the boost in revenue that the Government needs to cut the deficit and invest for the future.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Osborne's promise to cut borrowing is in doubt as the deficit rose by \u00a31.6 billion in September.

The career criminal, who is a fanatical Tottenham Hotspur fan was outraged after north London rivals Arsenal beat Hull in the FA Cup. The armed robber was especially annoyed as Hull went two goals ahead before being defeated in extra time. In response, Bronson smeared himself in Lurpack butter and attacked a dozen prison officers.

'It\u2019s almost impossible to say how much they will go for, the market will dictate that, but with his art selling for up to \u00a31,000 a piece in the past there will be a lot of interest. 'We have already had a lot of people phoning up to ask about the pictures. 'They are a peak into the mind of an intelligent man who, well lets say, has had a lot of issues. 'I would put an initial estimate of \u00a3400 to \u00a3600 but that is a starting estimate. 'There is no reserve on it, and I fully expect us to see a lot of interest in two weeks when it goes on sale. This is a very important and eclectic sale of British social history.' Bronson wants to use the funds generated from the sale to send his mother Eira Peterson on holiday as an apology for his most recent prison rampage . In one of the artworks for sale in the auction, Bronson, 61, calls for Kate Kray to be appointed prime minister and claims to have been 'born insane' He is also selling a handwritten poem entitled Asylum about Ronnie Kray .

This weekend, The Sunday Times published excerpts from Fielding's upcoming book, \"Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy,\" that reveal a crucial character, Mr. Darcy, has been killed off. Cue the collective gasps of horror from around the world. Fielding first introduced heroine Bridget Jones in 1996 with her best-selling \"Bridget Jones's Diary,\" a cheeky look at a 30-something single woman's adventures with life and love in London. During that initial installment, Bridget gets to know the prickly but sweet Mark Darcy, and in the follow-up, 1999's \"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,\" he proposes. But by the time we get to \"Mad About the Boy,\" Darcy is dead and Bridget is a 51-year-old widowed mother of two. (At least they got to have kids before he kicked the bucket -- the reason behind which is still unknown.) Fielding said when the new novel was announced that Bridget would be in a different place with \"Mad About the Boy.\" \"My life has moved on and Bridget's will move on, too,\" the author said in February. \"I hope people will have as much fun reading it, as I am writing it.\" That's questionable, considering some of the intense reactions fans have had to the news of Darcy's death. \"Just found out Mark Darcy, from the #BridgetJones sequel, was killed off !!!! I can't handle this!\" said one fan. \"Helen Fielding killed off Mark Darcy in the new Bridget Jones book? My hopeless romantic heart is devastated,\" said another. Given that these reactions have poured in on Twitter, the conversation does occasionally turn hyperbolic: \"The news said that Mark darcy gets killed off in the 3rd Bridget Jones, my life has ended,\" tweeted one distraught fan. Posted another: \"If Mark Darcy is really dead I have no reason to live anymore. #overlydramatic #bridgetjones #whywouldshedothis\" Yet another clung to some \"Dexter\"-inspired hope: \"Could it be that Mark Darcy fakes his own death & ends up as a lumberjack in the Pacific Northwest?\" the user queried. Either way, it is apparent that Bridget has moved on. In the Sunday Times excerpt, she describes her indecision between attending pal Talitha's 60th birthday party, and spending time with her \"toy boy,\" a nearly-30-year-old named Roxster. Both \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" and \"The Edge of Reason\" were adapted into movies starring Renee Zellweger as Bridget and Colin Firth as Mark Darcy, and a third movie is expected to be on the way.

The revelation that Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, was pregnant came after she was admitted to hospital in London on Monday afternoon suffering acute morning sickness. The newspaper said the royal couple had hoped to keep their baby news under wraps until Christmas Day, when she had passed the 12-week mark in her pregnancy. \"Kate expectations,\" declared popular British tabloid, The Sun, with an article detailing the treatment that Catherine, 30, was receiving for hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition that causes more severe nausea and vomiting than typical morning sickness. The newspaper said even senior royals, including Queen Elizabeth II, were taken by surprise as the couple had yet to break the news to family. The Sun's graphics department produced composite images of what they speculated the royal baby would look like as a baby of either gender, while the Mail ran mock-ups created by a U.S. forensic artist imagining how the child might look as a young boy or girl. The Times also led with news of Catherine's hospital dash, splashing a picture across its front page of a concerned William leaving London's King Edward VII hospital last night. The paper also joined the rush of feverish debate about the future royal's sex, potential name and position in the royal line of succession. Boy or girl, the new baby will be third in line to the throne, behind William and his father, Prince Charles, who will become a grandfather for the first time. The Times explained that an imminent change to the law means that if Catherine has a girl, the child will make history by being the first British princess not to suffer discrimination because of her sex. UK tabloid the Daily Express, in a \"royal souvenir special\" edition, ran a piece speculating that it was more likely that Catherine was carrying a girl, or twins, citing research that linked those outcomes to morning sickness. Bookmakers also look set for a royal bonanza, with Victoria, Frances and Mary among the frontrunners for the most likely girl's name, though the odds that William's first-born child will be named after his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, have been judged at between 9-1 and 12-1, The Times said. However, Elizabeth is the hot favorite at 8-1, according to leading British bookmaker Ladbrokes. Brooklyn and Chardonnay were listed as long shots by bookmakers. Ladbrokes has Charles and John at 10-1 when it comes to boy's names, but Harry, the name of the baby's uncle, is a distinct outsider at 33-1. Bookmakers are also taking bets on the baby's hair color, with one offering brown at 6-4 and red at 8-1, and another offering odds on the likelihood of an albino royal baby. Bookmakers were also taking bets on the child's birth weight, and the identity of the godparents. As expected, the name game is a white-hot pastime on social media, with #royalbabynames and #royalbaby among the biggest trending hashtags on Twitter. Among the more amusing suggestions were Cheryl and Jedward, reflecting Britain's recent obsession with television talent shows. Twitter was also a popular destination for celebrities and public figures alike to voice their happiness at the news. British Prime Minister David Cameron was swift to offer his congratulations. Businessman Richard Branson joined the well wishers. Former Wimbledon tennis champ Boris Becker tweeted a picture of himself giving two thumbs up with a message of congratulations. The news prompted responses from U.S. celebrities as well, with reality TV star Kim Kardashian tweeting her delight at the reports. News of the royal baby also grabbed column inches internationally. \"Royal baby a bonus for special editions,\" declared The Australian, as it predicted that Australian women's magazines would now go into coverage hyperdrive with a series of royal specials. \"Royal Baby a 'Delight,' Especially to Britain's Tabloids,\" ran the headline in The New York Times. The paper's Sarah Lyall observed that \"speculation began virtually the moment Kate Middleton said 'I will' to Prince William in April 2011, leaving an industry of tabloid newspapers and gossip magazines with a big black hole where their wedding coverage used to be.\" Lyall said those who had previously -- and incorrectly -- guessed something was afoot because Catherine was drinking water instead of wine at some official dinner could now finally claim to be right."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Catherine's pregnancy, revealed due to her hospitalization for severe morning sickness, has excited Britain and drawn international media attention.

Ben Carlson, a lifeguard with 15 years of experience, sped out with other guards in a rescue boat on Sunday and jumped into the water, but he quickly disappeared under 10- to 12-foot waves. The 32-year-old, a passionate surfer and one of the fastest swimmers on the 200-strong mostly seasonal lifeguard staff, was pronounced dead late on Sunday after rescuers searched for him by air, water and foot for three hours. Ben Carlson, a lifeguard with 15 years of experience, sped out with other guards in a rescue boat on Sunday and jumped into the water, but he quickly disappeared under 10- to 12-foot waves .

Conditions on Sunday were especially treacherous, with swells of 12 feet or more crashing in without warning and a strong current that took swimmers by surprise.

Carlson was the first lifeguard to die in Newport Beach, where locals and tourists alike flock to enjoy wide sandy beaches and waves that attract the attention of surfers worldwide . Newport Beach lifeguards rescued hundreds of swimmers over the weekend due to dangerous rip currents . The city gets 10 million beach visitors annually. The National Weather Service had warned Sunday of dangerous rip currents and high surf along Southern California beaches due to a swell originating in the Southern Hemisphere. Beachgoers said on Monday that a particularly huge swell surged ashore in the late afternoon, drenching blankets and upsetting picnics. Shortly after, rescue boats buzzed between the waves and helicopters began flying low over the water up and down the beach. \u2018The waves were huge. I saw it and I thought a tsunami was coming,\u2019 said Shirley Reinker, 72, who has lived along the beach for 40 years. The fallen lifeguard was raised in the inland suburbs of Southern California but always loved the ocean. As soon as Ben Carlson was old enough to get a driver's license, he tried to get a lifeguard job about an hour's drive away in Newport Beach, his father said. Rescuers took three hours to locate the teenager after he disappeared under a 10-foot high wave and were later seen tearfully consoling one another on Newport Beach . He traveled to surf big waves and played water polo at the University of California, Irvine. And while worked as beverages director for the Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant chain, he would lifeguard whenever he could, the elder Carlson said. He was one of the fastest swimmers on staff, Williams said. All lifeguards must be able to swim 0.6 miles in under 20 minutes and re-qualify annually, but Carlson had additional training to work on a boat as a rescue swimmer and drive patrol vehicles, Williams said. As a seasonal guard, Carlson made about $22 an hour. Friends hung his red lifeguard jacket over the bar at a local Irish pub blocks from the beach, a lifeguard hangout. A sign outside read: \u2018Ben would go. We love you. You will be missed.\u2019 An autopsy was scheduled for Tuesday.

Children and elderly people had to help clear some of the water from the roads using small buckets, while horses and carriages were also being used to get personal belongings and family members through the murky brown sludge.

Children, including this young boy in bare feet, and elderly people have had to help clear some of the water from the roads and pavements using small buckets . The floods led to false accusations that Israel had opened up dams along the river to intentionally cause the flooding, even though no dams exist in southern Israel. A spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Palestinian Territories (COGAT) told VICE News: 'These claims, I don't know who started them, but they are completely false. 'There are no dams in the southern part of Israel so we couldn't open any dams because there aren't any. I don't know how these rumours got around.' In an unrelated incident, an Israeli power company cut electricity in Nablus and Jenin, which are on the West Bank rather than Gaza, on the same day, for a short period of time. The state-owned company said that they made the decision to cut power because the Palestinian government owes them $492 million. The Israel Electric Corporation said it had long warned about the debt. A statement released by the company said: 'We limited for 45 minutes today the supply of electricity to five power lines in Nablus and Jenin.' Palestinians claimed that Israeli authorities opened dams along the river, causing water to rush down into a number of villages - but Israel said there are no dams to open .

The United States and its European allies say Sunday's referendum vote violated Ukraine's newly reforged constitution and amounts to a thinly veiled attempt by Russia to expand its borders to the Black Sea peninsula under a threat of force. Moscow asserts Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in an illegal coup, which ended Ukraine's constitutional authority. Russian President Vladimir Putin argues Crimeans should have the right to decide how they want to be governed going forward. So who's right? \"The answer depends on what your perspective is,\" said David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. \"The U.S. is buying into the argument of the Ukraine government, which is that the secession of Crimea from Ukraine is not constitutional under the terms of the Ukrainian constitution,\" Rothkopf said. \"The alternative argument is that all peoples have a right of self-determination and that if the people of Crimea choose not to be part of Ukraine, that is their prerogative in the same way that it was the choice of colonial powers to break away from the imperial powers that claimed them or parts of the former Yugoslavia were free to head off on their own,\" he added. Ukraine 'will never accept' Crimea annexation, President says . The standoff between the United States and Russia resembles tension from the Cold War era. \"We'll continue to make clear to Russia that further provocations will achieve nothing except to further isolate Russia and diminish its place in the world,\" President Barack Obama said on Monday. \"The international community will continue to stand together to oppose any violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity; and continued Russia military intervention in Ukraine will only deepen Russia's diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the Russia economy,\" Obama said. The United States and Europe imposed travel bans and froze assets of senior Russian and Crimean officials. The Obama administration went a step further by banning entry and freezing all U.S. assets held by any Russian government official or people with close financial ties to 11 people, including advisers to Putin. Legal or not, Crimean referendum will shape Ukraine crisis . Separate from the vote, Crimean lawmakers approved a resolution on Monday that declared the Black Sea peninsula an independent, sovereign state and requested to join the Russian Federation. Putin later in the day signed a decree that recognized Crimea's independence, the Kremlin said. He will address a joint session of Parliament on Crimea on Tuesday. Putin spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently by phone and stressed the Crimean referendum was in accordance with international law, including Article 1 of the U.N. Charter regarding the principle of self-determination. \"It was emphasized that Russia will respect the choice of the Crimean people,\" according to a Kremlin statement summarizing that conversation. Obama told Putin during a phone call on Sunday that \"Russia's actions were in violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" according to the White House. Putin pushed back, according to a statement from the Kremlin, and said the situation in Crimea is akin to Kosovo's breakaway from Serbia in 2008. \"Regarding the March 16 referendum in Crimea, Mr Putin said that the decision to hold the referendum was in line with international law and the U.N. Charter, and was also in line with the precedent set by Kosovo,\" the Kremlin said. \"The referendum was organized in such a way as to guarantee Crimea's population the possibility to freely express their will and exercise their right to self-determination,\" it said. West hits back at Russians over Crimea . Even within Crimea's pro-Russia majority, opinions about the legality of seceding are split. Voters proudly proclaimed their support for rejoining Russia as they stood in line in dreary weather to vote. However, one, who was too afraid to speak to CNN on camera, proclaimed the referendum illegal. The ethnic Tatars and younger voters have also questioned the legality of secession. Many of the Tatar minority boycotted the referendum with some leaders calling it \"a farce\" forced by armed men.

Choice Number One would be to move fairly quickly to annex Crimea and that is going to then seem as a very naked land grab and will make it very difficult then for a dialogue to move forward,\" Pifer said. \"That move will likely mean Western nations will ratchet up the level of sanctions, Pifer said. \"The alternative is they take the vote but that the Russians don't move very quickly,\" Pifer said. \"They let Crimea basically stay in some limbo status which will create some opportunity perhaps for negotiation that can diffuse this crisis.\" CNN's Tom Cohen and Marie-Louise Gumuchian, and CNN Money's Mark Thompson contributed to this report."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The U.S. and Europe view Crimea's secession and declaration of independence as unconstitutional, leading to sanctions on Russia.

A procession of students, their hands raised, slowly making their way out of the danger zone. But the handling of Friday's shooting at Arapahoe High School -- just 10 miles from the scene of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting where two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher before fatally shooting themselves -- drew important lessons from the earlier bloodshed. At Arapahoe High School, where senior Claire Davis, 17, was critically injured before the shooter turned the gun on himself, law enforcement officers responded within minutes and immediately entered the school to confront the gunman rather than surrounding the building, authorities said. As the sound of shots reverberated through the corridors, teachers immediately followed procedures put in place after Columbine, locking the doors and moving students to the rear of classrooms. \"That's straight out of Columbine,\" Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, a Cleveland-based consulting firm, told CNN Saturday. \"The goal is to proceed and neutralize the shooter. Columbine really revolutionized the way law enforcement responds to active shooters.\" Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson credited the quick police response time for the fact that student Karl Pierson, the gunman, stopped firing on others and turned his weapon on himself. In fact, Robinson told reporters Saturday, Pierson killed himself less than 1 minute, 20 seconds after entering the school. Robinson said a deputy sheriff assigned as a school resource officer and an unarmed security guard immediately closed in on the shooter. \"That one minute and 20 seconds, in my mind, is extraordinarily relevant,\" he said, noting that Pierson was heavily armed, with ammunition, a knife and three explosives. Authorities knew from research and contact with forensic psychologists that school shooters typically continue firing until confronted by law enforcement, Robinson said. \"We believe that the response from the school resource officer and from the unarmed school security officer was absolutely critical to the fact we did not have additional injury and or death,\" he said. Robinson said the so-called active shooter response protocol, which was developed after Columbine, was put into place. In addition, school staff and students implemented a well-rehearsed lockdown practice. \"The combination of quick response by the resource officer and the implementation of a lockdown protocol caused the children and staff to be safe,\" he said. \"Both protocols came together as they were designed to do.\" Friday's shooting came on the eve of the one year anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, where Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six adults at the now-demolished elementary school in the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. Newtown marks anniversary of school killings . \"It's very unfortunate that we have to say that there's a textbook response on the way to respond to these, because that textbook was written based on all of the incidents that we've had and the lessons learned,\" Trump said. Trump said both Sandy Hook and the latest shooting in Colorado highlight the importance of \"training and engaging\" school support staff -- from custodians to school secretaries to maintenance and food service workers -- on how to best respond during these incidents. In Sandy Hook, a school custodian's 911 calls provided authorities some of the first information about what was happening. \"Often these people are not getting training in school emergency planning,\" Trump said. \"In a critical incident, they may be the first person to respond.\" At Arapahoe High School, a school janitor spotted Pierson, whose intended target was a faculty member, in his tactical gear, he told CNN affiliate KMGH. \"It just looked weird,\" Fabian Llerenas said. \"He went in, and I heard two pops. That's when I knew. I said, 'They are shooting in the school.'\" Llerenas said he called 911 and then escorted the targeted faculty member out of the school. Pierson had fired at the man but missed, Llerenas told KUSA. \"He was so [shaken] up, he felt the wind hit, out of the shotgun just blew his hair, but it didn't hit him. It was that scary for him,\" Llerenas said. \"In my opinion, that was the most important tactical decision that could have been made,\" Robinson said. The faculty member \"left that school in an effort to try to encourage the shooter to also leave the school.\" Trump said other lessons learned from Columbine included the controlled evacuations and pat-down searches of students in a secure area. Self evacuations can create chaos for the police. Additionally, schools now have predesignated parent-student \"reunification centers\" to prevent parents from showing up at the scene and interfering with law enforcement, as was the case in Sandy Hook, Trump said. \"The lessons of Columbine are still the best practices,\" Trump said. After Sandy Hook. Trump said, some officials advocated a \"run, hide or fight\" approach developed for workplace shootings in which teachers and students are encouraged to be prepared to throw things at gunmen. Some even suggested that elementary school students use items such as cans of soup to attack gunmen. Trump called it a \"high risk, high liability proposition.\" \"The good news is that we're getting better at preventing and responding to these incidents,\" he said. \"The bad news is that there will be cases that slip through the cracks.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the Arapahoe High School shooting, law enforcement quickly enacted an 'active shooter response protocol'.

Year after year, Joel Blanc makes the short pilgrimage from his Paris studio to the Stade Roland Garros for the tennis year's second grand slam, aiming to encapsulate the tournament's magic onto his canvas. In a style reminiscent of those Impressionist forefathers, he brings to life in his paintings what he witnesses taking place in front of him on the famous red clay courts. \"When I begin the painting, I don't know exactly what will happen but I know what I want to introduce in the beginning. After, it's a story of life,\" he told CNN's Open Court show. \"I know how it begins, but I don't know how it finishes.\" A key principle of Impressionism was to paint outdoors rather than inside a studio, so it's a style tailor-made to Blanc's own way of working. It's an approach that has won over tennis stars such as Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal -- both fans and owners of the Frenchman's paintings -- or television companies, who invite him to cover sporting events. Making his first visit to depict the action on the main court of Philippe Chatrier in 2004, Blanc has returned every year since, attracted by both the stadium and the French Open's allure and charm. \"Roland Garros is my favorite place,\" says the 68-year-old. \"It's very special, it's near to my studio, I'm like a neighbor. \"It's like a fascination in Paris, the time of Roland Garros in Paris is very special so there is a real attraction,\" he says. \"I am very proud to be there.\" The painter had to wait some time, however, before that short pilgrimage from his studio could become a reality. In the same way that the original artists of the Impressionism movement, established in Paris in the 1870s, initially drew criticism for their apparent trivial approach to art, Blanc had his own detractors -- his parents. They wanted him to forge a career as a surgeon or dentist rather than become an artist -- something that ultimately put him in good stead years down the line. \"I have to thank them for that as they obliged me not to be an artist just like that, they obliged me to learn anatomy at school,\" says Blanc, who was born in Toulon in the south of France. \"But all those years of learning actually gave me the great freedom for painting -- from horses to the body, from landscape to anything I have to draw. I know the proportions, I know everything. I'm able to do it.\" From the late 1880s the public's perception became more favorable towards the Impressionism movement, much like the trajectory of Blanc's career. Following an education at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, Blanc first developed his passion for capturing the moment in equestrian events -- making a living out of depicting horses and their riders. And in keeping with the tradition of Impressionism, he also often found himself recreating scenes from the French countryside. It was not until far further down the line, though, at the age of 57, that Blanc got his real break as an artist when he was invited to cover the World Athletics Championships in Paris in 2003 by French television station France 2. \"I knew this was what I wanted to do. I was supported by the runners as I put all my body into my work, so I was like one of them,\" he recalls. \"This woman asked me to finish a painting and give it to a 100-meter runner at the end, so I finished it in 10 seconds and gave it to him!\" That success prompted another invitation from France 2 to cover the following year's French Open. \"In my work, I need to have a challenge and draw something that other people can't do, so I turned to sport,\" he says. \"What I feel when I do this type of painting is a communion with what I draw. \"I have to be not inside (the athlete) but it's something like communion -- my eyes and my hand. I don't take care of my hand, it's only a problem of mind.\" Blanc, who has covered other sports such as golf and rugby, thrives on the unpredictability of capturing these instant action moments. \"Every sport has its own specialty. For example, polo ... it's like a fight, it's very quick and the movement of horses change in a second,\" he says. \"So if you don't decide what you want to represent, it's like rugby, it changes very quickly. If you don't decide quickly, you are lost. You have to clear your mind in every sport.\" When Blanc first put his easel on the side of a tennis court, he was unaware of the endless possibilities that were about to unfold both on court and in his mind. \"The first time I thought, like for golf, that tennis was always the same,\" he says. \"I have been painting Nadal and Federer for years and years when they were always in the final, in Monte Carlo and at Roland Garros, and I could say it's always the same story. \"But it's not, because there is an adaption from one to the other and the strategy of each one is very specific, and the movements then change. And the movement has to be taken in the very instant.\" Sport is by nature cyclical, adds Blanc, but the same events every year bring fresh inspiration. \"If something new doesn't happen then the people will be bored by that, but every time we all witness something new without fail.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Joel Blanc, an Impressionist artist, has been painting the French Open at Stade Roland Garros, his favorite place, since 2004.

CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour -- who covered the story -- called the verdicts \"a real turning point and a milestone in justice.\"  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour on the verdict \u00bb . \"It sends a message that right up the chain of command, you cannot hide,\" Amanpour said. The court said Bagosora was a key figure in drawing up plans for the genocide. A Hutu, Bagosora was convicted of ordering Hutu militia to slaughter rival Tutsis. The massacres began after a plane crash on April 6, 1994 that killed the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi. The court said the plane was brought down by a surface-to-air missile fired from the airport in Kigali, the Rwandan capital.  Watch what happened in the court \u00bb . Bagosora decided the military should take over and he refused to involve the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, in any discussions, the court found. April 7, while Bagosora held a crisis meeting with top military officials, the prime minister was arrested, sexually assaulted and killed by top members of the Rwandan Army, the court found.  Find out more about the world's killing fields \u00bb . That made Bagosora the head of all political and military affairs in Rwanda, and in that capacity, he was at the top of the chain of command. The same day the prime minister was killed, the court said, army personnel confined and killed four important opposition leaders -- including the president of the constitutional court and government ministers -- and murdered 10 Belgian peacekeepers who had been dispatched to the prime minister's residence. The court found Bagosora bore responsibility for those and other killings because he commanded those who carried out the crimes. \"Bagosora was the highest authority in the Ministry of Defense and exercised effective control of the Rwandan army and gendarmerie,\" said Presiding Judge Erik Mose. \"He's therefore responsible for the murder of the prime minister, the four opposition politicians, the 10 Belgian peacekeepers, as well as the extensive military involvement in the killing of civilians during this period.\" ICTR Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow said the convicted men \"prepared, planned, ordered, directed, incited, encouraged and approved the murder of innocent civilian Tutsis.\" The killings were carried out by military personnel on the orders of Rwandan authorities including Bagosora, the court said. The court found that from April to July 1994, Bagosora exercised authority over members of the Rwandan Army and their militiamen, who committed massacres throughout Rwanda with Bagosora's knowledge. \"In all the regions of the country, members of the Tutsi population who were fleeing from the massacres on their hills sought refuge in locations they thought would be safe, often on the recommendation of the local civil and military authorities,\" the indictment said. \"In many of these places, despite the promise that they would be protected by the local civil and military authorities, the refugees were attacked, abducted and massacred, often on the orders or with the complicity of those same authorities.\" The indictment against Bagosora alleged he had been opposed to concessions made by his government to Tutsi rebels at 1993 peace talks in Tanzania, and had left the negotiations saying he was returning to Rwanda to \"prepare the apocalypse.\" The U.N. established the tribunal in late 1994. The trial began in April 2002 and has been deliberating since June 1, 2007. During the trial, the court heard 242 witnesses -- 82 for the prosecution and 160 for the defense. The three convicted men will be held in the tribunal's custody until a state can be found to house them. The genocide's impact is still be felt today, with recent fighting in neighbouring Congo blamed on lingering tensions from the slaughter.

The changes in Cuban policy was unveiled before President Obama's trip to the Summit of the Americas. The move represents a significant shift in a U.S. policy that had remained largely unchanged for nearly half a century. It comes days before Obama leaves for a key meeting of hemispheric powers, the Summit of the Americas, in Trinidad and Tobago. \"President Obama has directed that a series of steps be taken to reach out to the Cuban people to support their desire to enjoy basic human rights and to freely determine their country's future,\" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said. Obama also ordered new steps to promote the \"freer flow of information among the Cuban people and between those in Cuba and the rest of the world, as well as to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian items directly to the Cuban people,\" Gibbs added. The president took \"these steps [in part] to help bridge the gap among divided Cuban families.\" Obama believes that the change in U.S. policy will ultimately help bring about a more tolerant, democratic Cuban government, noted White House Latin American policy adviser Dan Restrepo. He thinks \"that creating independence, creating space for the Cuban people to operate freely from the regime is the kind of space they need to start the process toward a more democratic Cuba,\" Restrepo said. Several key components of America's embargo on the island nation will be preserved, however. Among other things, Americans will still be barred from sending gifts or other items to high-ranking Cuban government officials and Communist Party members. Travel restrictions for Americans of non-Cuban descent will also remain in place. Critics of the change blasted the administration for unilaterally changing what had been a long-settled U.S. policy. President Ra\u00fal Castro's \"dictatorship is one of the most brutal in the world. The U.S. economic embargo must remain in place until tyranny gives way to freedom and democracy,\" Rep. Connie Mack, R-Florida, said in a written statement. Obama \"should not make any unilateral change in America's policy toward Cuba. Instead, Congress should vigorously debate these and other ideas before any substantive policy changes are implemented.\" Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Florida, and a native of Cuba, had kinder words for the administration, saying, \"The announcement today is good news for Cuban families separated by the lack of freedom in Cuba.\" He said that, in turn, the Cuban government should focus on improving its relationships with its citizens and the United States. \"Lowering remittance charges and allowing travel for Cuban families wishing to see relatives abroad are two steps the Cuban regime could immediately take that would show change in Havana,\" he said. Reps. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, and Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, held a news conference last week urging Obama to refrain from easing trade embargo or travel restrictions until the Cuban government releases all \"prisoners of conscience,\" shows greater respect for freedom of religion and speech, and holds \"free and fair\" elections. \"Over the past 50 years, the Castros and their secret police have been directly responsible for killing thousands of nonviolent, courageous pro-democracy activists and for jailing and torturing tens of thousands of others. And they continue to this day to perpetrate their brutal crimes,\" Smith said. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, responded that it makes no sense to continue what she characterized as a failed policy.  Watch report on easing of travel restrictions \u00bb . \"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but by any objective standard, our current policy toward Cuba just hasn't worked. Simply put, it's time to open dialogue and discussion with Cuba,\" she said in a written statement. Lee and other Congressional Black Caucus members met in Havana this month with Ra\u00fal Castro and his brother, former President Fidel Castro. Several members of Congress see broader relations with Cuba as vital to U.S. interests. A group of senators and other supporters unveiled a bill March 31 to lift the 47-year-old travel ban to Cuba. \"I think that we finally reached a new watermark here on this issue,\" said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota, one of the bill's sponsors. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, another sponsor of the bill, issued a draft report in February that said it was time to reconsider the economic sanctions. Lugar is the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Sarah Stephens, director of the Cuba Travel Projects and one of the leading advocates pushing for an end to the embargo, said Monday that \"these are welcome steps, but the right course is to allow all Americans to travel to Cuba, to open up commerce and to directly engage the Cuban government in diplomacy and solving problems in both countries' interests.\"  Watch report on whether Cuba is ready for U.S. tourists \u00bb . Obama \"has a historic opportunity not to be the last president of the Cold War but the first president to turn the page in U.S.-Cuba relations,\" she argued. Before he was elected president, Obama promised to lower some of the barriers in Cuban-American relations. Provisions attached to a $410 billion supplemental budget Obama signed in March also made it easier for Cuban-Americans to travel to Cuba and to send money to family members on the island. In addition, they facilitated the permitted sales of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. The provisions loosened restrictions enacted by President George W. Bush after he came to office in 2001. Obama's moves appear to be tracking the overall public sentiment on what has historically been a hot-button political issue. Seventy-one percent of Americans think the United States should re-establish diplomatic relations with Cuba, according an April 3-5 CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, and 64 percent think the United States should lift the travel ban to Cuba for all Americans. Sampling error for the poll was plus or minus 3 percentage points."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Obama's policy shift on Cuba has drawn mixed responses.

The ministry reiterated that there is no danger from eating meat in Spain. \"The appearance of these sporadic cases is within the predictions that were made at the European level more than nine years ago,\" the ministry statement said.

While Zelaya has entered Honduras since the military roused him in his pajamas and sent him into exile, Saturday marked the first time he returned without fear of prosecution.

Scientists are using the world's biggest telescope, buried deep under the South Pole, to try to unravel the mysteries of tiny particles known as neutrinos . The discovery could shed light on how the universe was made. The mega-detector, called IceCube, took 10 years to build 8,000ft below the Antarctic ice. At one cubic km, it is bigger than the Empire State building, the Chicago Sears Tower - now known as Willis Tower - and Shanghai's World Financial Center combined. The final Digital Optical Module (DOM) descends down a bore hole in the ice as it is deployed in the IceCube array, the world's largest neutrino observatory, built under the Antarctic tundra near the US Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station . The IceCube array uses strings of sensors taht are lowered down deep boreholes in the ice. The IceTop has two layers of detectors just below the surface. The Eiffel Tower is depicted, bottom right, to show the detector's size . Very little is known about neutrinos, . but they are believed to carry information about the birth of our . galaxy and the mystery of black holes. Physicists think that they are born . when violent cosmic events, such as colliding galaxies or distant black . holes, occur at the very edges of the universe. Able . to travel billions of light years through space without being absorbed . or deflected either by magnetic fields or by atoms, these mysterious . high-energy particles could provide answers to some of the most . fundamental questions about the universe. Designed to observe neutrinos, which are emitted by exploding stars and move close to the speed of light, the telescope is attracting new attention in the wake of last week's discovery of a particle that appears to be the Higgs boson - a basic building block of the universe. \u2018You hold up your finger and a hundred billion neutrinos pass through it every second from the sun,\u2019 said Jenni Adams, a physicist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, who works on IceCube. IceCube is essentially a string of light detectors buried in the ice through hot water drilling. When neutrinos, which are everywhere, interact in the ice, they produce charged particles that then create light, which can be detected. The ice acts as a net that isolates the neutrinos, making them easier to observe. It also protects the telescope from potentially damaging radiation. \u2018If a supernova goes off in our galaxy now, we can detect hundreds of neutrinos with IceCube,\u2019 Adams told reporters at the International Conference on High Energy Physics in Melbourne. \u2018We won't be able to see them individually, but the whole detector will just light up like a massive fireworks display.\u2019 Artist's impression of a 'Cerenkov light cone' passing through the IceCube telescope, left.

Scientists are attempting to track the particles to discover their points of origin, in the hope that will give clues on what happens in space, particularly in unseen parts of the universe known as dark matter. Before IceCube was completed in 2010, scientists had observed just 14 neutrinos. With the huge new instrument, paired with another telescope in the Mediterranean, hundreds of neutrinos have been detected. So far, all of those have been created in the earth's atmosphere, but IceCube scientists hope to eventually detect those from space. \u2018Neutrinos ... will point back to where they came from,\u2019 Adams said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Physicist Jenni Adams uses the IceCube telescope and a smaller detector, AMANDA, to study neutrinos and detect supernovas.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon, the presiding judge over divorce cases, granted a motion by attorney Larry Ginsberg to withdraw from the case on Wednesday. Judge Mark Juhas, who was slated to preside over the trial, ordered the proceedings to be delayed until January 5 to give Collins' estranged wife Faye Grant time to find a new lawyer. Scroll down for video . The trial over Stephen Collins' divorce has been delayed after the attorney of his estranged wife Faye Grant withdrew from the case just hours before testimony was supposed to begin . The former couple had been scheduled to start an eight-day trial on how to divide their assets and how much spousal support Grant should receive. Collins, who starred in the series 7th Heaven, was not present in court.\u00a0Grant represented herself at a hearing in which the trial was delayed and her estranged husband's lawyer sought to reduce her spousal support payments. The case has been complicated by the release of audio in which the actor purportedly acknowledges molesting underage girls. Collins, 67, has lost roles as a result of the recording, including a $75,000 part in the upcoming film Ted 2. The leaked recording has cost Collins a role in the upcoming film Ted 2 and knocked scheduled re-runs of 7th Heaven off two cable networks . His attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan said on Wednesday that the actor was also losing residual income on the 7th Heaven series. Kaplan said having Ginsberg withdraw hours before the trial's start would be 'visiting a terrible hardship on Mr. Collins.' He said the actor has spent $1 million already on attorneys' and experts' fees in the case, and the delay would probably cost him another $200,000. The decades-old molestation allegations are being investigated by authorities in Los Angeles and New York. The actor has not been charged. Collins contends that his estranged wife should receive no support because the recording from a 2012 couple's counseling session and its subsequent posting by celebrity website TMZ has destroyed his career. Gordon ruled on the motion after meeting in closed session with Ginsberg and Grant. Collins had worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, including appearing in the 1979 movie Star Trek: The Motion Picture, left, . Kaplan, Collins' attorney, was kept out of the proceedings so that Ginsberg could give details on why he was leaving the case abruptly. Gordon said Ginsberg's motion was not motivated by an effort to delay the trial and that there was a complete breakdown in the lawyer's communications with Grant. Collins filed for divorce in 2012 and most of the issues in the case have been about money, although Grant included details about the molestation allegations in court filings last year. Grant has said she gave police the audio only after Collins refused to seek appropriate treatment. Grant has denied giving the recording to TMZ. Grant, who is an actress who has said in court filings she put her career largely on hold during her marriage to Collins, is seeking to maintain $13,000 a month in spousal support payments. Juhas refused a request on Wednesday by Kaplan to reduce Collins' support payments immediately. Collins had worked steadily in television and movie roles since the early 1970s, with appearances in movies such as All the President's Men, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, and recurring roles on TV series after 7th Heaven concluded its 11-season run in 2007."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Stephen Collins' divorce trial, set to decide on asset division and spousal support for Faye Grant, has been delayed due to her lawyer's withdrawal.

Shops and streets at Tahrir Square were closed as Morsy supporters and critics threw rocks at one another. At least 121 people were injured, a spokesman for the health ministry said. Thousands turned out for the protest, with some groups chanting, \"Leave Morsy.\" Protesters threw Molotov cocktails at one another, and firecrackers sounded amid clashes around Tahrir and Talat Harb squares. Read more: Should U.S. worry about Morsy? Witnesses said protesters from the Muslim Brotherhood attacked and destroyed a stage built by right-wing groups that criticize Morsy. The Brotherhood said two of their buses were burned near Tahrir Square and their headquarters was burned in Mahala. The same protesters that toppled President Hosni Mubarak in 2011 were scheduled to meet in five locations Friday and march toward Tahrir Square around 3 p.m. \"We want retribution for all the martyrs of the revolution. Those Mubarak cronies released from prison for the camel attack must return behind bars, and we also demand a drafted constitution that represents all factions in a civil democratic language,\" Rami Shaath told CNN, explaining the main demands of the nationwide protest. Shaath, a founding member of the Egyptian Revolutionary Alliance, a bloc of secular and religious parties, was referring to the February 2011 \"Battle of the Camel,\" street violence in which regime supporters, backed by men on horses and camels, attacked opposition demonstrators. He says he wants to keep Egypt's revolution going while the media covers Morsy's political maneuvers. The acquittal Thursday of all suspects detained in relation to the battle last year has sparked a wave of discontent among youths and the Islamic movement across the country -- especially since 24 of those suspects were former senior members of Mubarak's regime. Most of the officers charged with killing more than 800 protesters during the uprising have not been convicted. \"We also want the retrial of Mubarak, his Minister of Interior Habib El Adly and the seven chief police officers accused of killing the martyrs,\" Shaath said. Many people relate the latest wave of acquittals to the removal of General Prosecutor Abdul Majid Mahmoud on Thursday night. \"The general prosecutor submitted his resignation to the president, and he appointed him as an ambassador to the Vatican,\" presidential spokesman Yaser Ali told CNN. Mahmoud's removal has been a top demand during the many \"million-man\" protests that followed Mubarak's ouster. In a tone of defiance, Adel Saeed, the general prosecutor's official spokesman, released a statement saying that the prosecutor has not resigned and that he will continue his business as usual, as the judicial system bans the president from firing the general prosecutor. iReport video: Clashes in Tahrir Square . \"He is a corrupted man appointed by Mubarak, and it would be a disgrace to the Vatican if this is true,\" said Mohamed Farhat, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. Many people who followed the revolution know the vital role the young revolutionaries took in sparking the uprising against Mubarak. The same personalities that toppled the regime have been discreetly applying pressure by mobilizing laborers to demand more rights and better pay. Activist Gigi Ibrahim and her husband, Hossam El-Hamalawy, a member of the Socialist movement, have supported the laborers and helped them strike against the government, including this week's action by doctors, in which people in hundreds of public hospitals took part in a partial strike and demanded higher wages. More than 30,000 people took part, the Ministry of Health said. \"If the government does not provide to the people, we may see a 'revolution of the hungry' next,\" Ibrahim said. The political duo, along with certain right-wing groups, also aided last week's general transportation strike. \"They all wanted to revolt demanding better pay, so we helped them by providing lawyers, organizing meeting points and involving media to pressure Morsy to accomplish what he promised to do\" Ibrahim told CNN. Morsy on Wednesday announced a presidential decree to pardon all those arrested between the January 25 uprising and June 2012. The revolutionaries welcomed the decision with some reservations. \"What are the criteria they are using to identify the true revolutionaries from the thugs? No cop has been convicted for killing us, and now, Mubarak's former NDP (National Democratic Party) members are loose after they hired men on camels who charged into Tahrir Square, beating us with whips and sticks,\" Shaath said. Thousands of protesters took to the streets Wednesday to remember the 27 protesters killed by the army on October 9, 2011, in what has become known as the Maspero Massacre. Protesters demanded the arrest and trial of Gen. Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, the former head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which was running the country then. Dozens of political parties and movements, along with the Muslim Brotherhood, say they will join the protests. Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh, a former presidential candidate, has announced that members of his party will protest on courthouse steps across the nation. Morsy, in his latest presidential speech, announced that he had completed 75% of his promises in regards to security, traffic and garbage removal. A court ruling this month is expected to dissolve an assembly appointed to draft a new constitution. Islamic movements hold 80% of the seats, according to lawyer Sameh Ashour, a member of the assembly. \"If the court dissolves the assembly, then President Morsy will appoint the new team. I hope he does not please his Muslim Brotherhood supporters and remain fair for all sects -- women, Coptics and legal constitutional experts,\" Shaath said.

Sarah Broadfield, 34, feared she would never have children after spending \u00a315,000 on fertility treatment and two miscarriages that left her devastated. But when she became pregnant again in November last year, she began taking the 2p aspirin each day after doctors said her miscarriages were caused by her blood being too 'sticky'. Sarah Broadfield, 34, finally gave birth to son Alfie (pictured) after seven rounds of IVF and two miscarriages . After being diagnosed with Antiphospholipis syndrome, which is known to cause miscarriages in pregnant women, Mrs Broadfield (pictured left during her pregnancy) was told to take a daily aspirin . The aspirin helped prevent a miscarriage and baby Alfie (pictured) was born in August weighing a healthy 8lb . She had been diagnosed with Antiphospholipid syndrome, which causes an increased risk of blood clots and miscarriage. However aspirin can help by thinning the blood, preventing this. Nine months later, her son Alfie was born in August 2014, weighing a healthy 8lb. Mrs Broadfield, a nurse, said: 'Finally holding Alfie in my arms after everything we've been through was the best moment of my life - and it's all thanks to me taking an aspirin a day.' She had married her 36-year-old husband Chris, an electrician, in 2006 and a year later they started trying for a baby, with hopes of eventually having two children. But, two years later, with no success, the couple went to see their GP for fertility tests. Although Mrs Broadfield had previously been diagnosed with endometriosis, doctors didn't believe this was affecting her fertility, but couldn't find another explanation. The couple were referred for IVF through the NHS but two rounds of treatment failed. 'The first failure was the most devastating because I really thought it would work,' Mrs Broadfield said. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is also known as Hughes syndrome, is a disorder of the immune system that causes an increased risk of blood clots. Pregnant women with APS also have an increased risk of having a miscarriage, although the exact reasons for this are uncertain. At least 15 per cent of recurrent miscarriages (having three or more miscarriages in a row) occur as a result of APS, and it is now recognised as the most common, treatable cause. Generally, if a woman is diagnosed with APS following miscarriages, she will be treated daily with low dose aspirin (75mg-150mg). Treatment with aspirin can  help pregnant women improve their chances of having a successful pregnancy. With treatment, it's estimated there is about an 80 per cent chance of having a successful pregnancy. In April this year, U.S. scientists found low doses of the drug could improve the chances of conception and of having a live birth. It can help women who have recently lost a baby to conceive again . This could be because the drug increases blood flow to the womb, they said. 'Even though I knew it wasn't my fault, I blamed myself. I felt like I'd failed as a woman.' When a third IVF cycle failed, the couple scraped together their savings, as well as getting some help from their parents, and paid for a fourth attempt at a private hospital. They were delighted when Sarah became pregnant a few weeks later. At the six week scan, everything looked fine but, two weeks later, a second scan showed that she had suffered a 'silent miscarriage' and the baby had stopped developing in her womb. 'It was heart-breaking but we were reassured that at least I'd managed to become pregnant this time. 'When it happened for a second time though, we started to wonder if there was a serious problem,' she said. Following the two miscarriages at eight weeks, the couple were referred to the Liverpool Miscarriage Clinic and blood tests showed that Mrs Broadfield had Antiphospholipid syndrome (AS), a disorder of the immune system which causes an increased risk of blood clots. People with AS are at risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and artery clots, but the condition is particularly dangerous to pregnant women as it can lead to miscarriages. It's estimated that AS is responsible for one in six cases of multiple miscarriages, as well as one in six cases of deep vein thrombosis. For Mrs Broadfield, the condition did not explain why she hadn't become pregnant naturally - but did explain why she'd miscarried twice. She said: 'It was such a relief to know what was wrong and the solution seemed impossibly simple.' Because of its blood-thinning qualities, an aspirin a day has long been hailed as a means of preventing strokes and some experts say it could also reduce the risk of cancer. Doctors advised Mrs Broadfield the daily tablet throughout her pregnancy would thin her blood and dramatically reduce the risk of her miscarrying for a third time. So, the couple embarked on their final round of IVF, with two eggs from previous attempts being implanted. Mrs Broadfield married electrician husband Chris, 36,\u00a0in 2006 and a year later they started trying for a baby . At the 20 week scan doctors said Alfie was developing normally, but Mrs Broadfield said she was a 'nervous wreck' before every scan, 'waiting for them to deliver bad news' 'By that stage, we were wrung-out, emotionally and financially so we decided it would be our last go,' she added. Weeks later, she became pregnant with twins and started her 'aspirin therapy', as well as having an anti-clotting injection daily throughout the pregnancy. Sadly, at the six week scan, the couple were told that one of the foetuses had failed. But, despite their disappointment, they were relieved to see the second baby was developing normally. Aspirin, which helped her give birth to son Alfie, was 'modern day magic', Mrs Broadfield said . 'The doctors kept a really close eye on us, which was reassuring, but I was still a nervous wreck before every scan, waiting for them to deliver bad news,' she said. Superstitious, Mr and Mrs Broadfield even waited until the later stages of the pregnancy before preparing their baby's nursery. As her risk of having a stillbirth was heightened, the baby was induced at 38 weeks and the couple's baby boy Alfie came along on August 1st 2014. Mrs Broadfield described how holding her baby in her arms was a moment of both joy and terror. She said: 'Just after he was born, he went quiet and I panicked. Then we heard him cry and it was the best moment ever,' she said. She added: 'Holding him in my arms, it felt so surreal, as we'd waited so long to meet him.' The next day, they brought Alfie home and he continues to thrive. 'They have no plans to embark on more IVF but she knows what to do if another baby were to come along. 'If only I'd known that taking one aspirin a day could help me so much,' she said. 'It would have saved us a lot of heartache. 'I wanted to speak out to hopefully help any other women who might have this condition without knowing it. 'For us, the aspirin was modern day magic and we always keep a box in our cupboard now, just in case.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sarah Broadfield, 34, and her husband Chris spent \u00a315,000 on fertility treatments, including IVF attempts at a private hospital.

Bayern came from two goals behind for a 4-3 win at Borussia Moenchengladbach while Dortmund surrendered a lead to lose 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim, who kept their hopes of avoiding the drop alive. Bayern's 29th league win from 34 matches gave them a record tally of 91 points -- fully 25 points clear of Dortmund, who had been the reigning champions. Veteran Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes was saying farewell to the Bundesliga after 1,011 games -- he will be replaced by Pep Guardiola next season -- and the match had an added poignancy because it was against one of his former sides. They looked like spoiling his party as they led Bayern 3-1 inside the first 10 minutes, but Franck Ribery with a double, also setting up Arjen Robben for the second half winner, left Heynckes beaming. \"I had the feeling the team were still at last Saturday's party to celebrate the league title,\" he told their official website. \"But the team slowly got the game under control and we played like we're used to in the second half. I realized my team wanted to win for me.\" Heynckes had fielded a full strength line-up tipped to start next Saturday's final but Austrian defender Martin Stranzl and striker Mike Hanke, on his farewell for Moenchengladbach, put the home side 2-0 ahead in the opening moments. Javi Martinez pulled one back for the champions before Havard Nordtveit made it 3-1. Bayern had conceded only 15 goals in the entire Bundesliga season going into the final match. Then came Ribery to the rescue with a fine strike on 18 minutes, an equalizer early in the second half and a cross for Robben to tap home the winner. Dortmund's opponents Hoffenheim were fighting for their Bundesliga life and it looked bleak for the strugglers when Robert Lewandowski put the home side ahead after just six minutes -- the 24th of the league campaign for the Polish star. Juergen Klopp's men should have added to their tally but with 13 minutes left Mats Hummels fouled Kevin Volland to concede a penalty and also limped off with a turned ankle, leaving him a possible doubt for next week's final. Sejad Salihovic leveled from the spot and four minutes later had a second penalty opportunity after home keeper Roman Weidenfeller fouled Sven Schipplock and was sent off. Salihovic netted the penalty and Hoffenheim held on to earn a relegation playoff against Kaiserslautern. \"We now draw a thick line under the Bundesliga season and see now if all the players are fit for the final,\" Klopp told AFP after the defeat. Elsewhere, Schalke 04 earned a Champions League spot for next season with a 2-1 win at SC Freiburg, who will have to settle for a Europa League place. Julian Draxler put Schalke ahead in the first half but Jonathan Schmid leveled for Freiburg just after the break. An own goal from Julian Schuster saw Schalke ahead again and left Freiburg in fifth place in the final standings. With Hoffenheim winning, Fortuna Dusseldorf were automatically relegated, losing 3-0 at Hanover.

West Antarctica is warming almost twice as fast as previously believed, a new study shows, heightening fears of a catastrophic thaw that raise water levels from San Francisco to Shanghai. Annual average temperatures at the Byrd research station there have risen 2.4C (4.3F) since the Fifties, it said, one of the fastest gains on the planet and three times the global average. West Antarctica holds enough ice to raise world sea levels by at least 3.3m (11ft) if it ever all melted. Melting: A new study raises the alarm over rising sea levels due to climate change in the Antarctic . Heating up: On this map, the colour intensity indicates areas around Antarctica that are likely experiencing comparable warming to Byrd Station, which is marked by the star . That process would take centuries, but even a much more modest thaw could threaten low-lying areas and coastal cities across the planet. 'Continued summer warming in West Antarctica could upset the surface mass balance of the ice sheet, so that the region could make an even bigger contribution to sea level rise than it already does,' said David Bromwich, professor of geography at Ohio State University and senior research scientist at the Byrd station. 'Even without generating significant mass loss directly, surface melting on the WAIS could contribute to sea level indirectly, by weakening the West Antarctic ice shelves that restrain the region's natural ice flow into the ocean.' Low-lying nations from Bangladesh to . Tuvalu are especially vulnerable to sea level rise, as are coastal . cities from London to Buenos Aires. Sea levels have risen by about 20cm . (8in) over the past century. The . United Nations panel of climate experts projects that sea levels will . rise by between 18 and 59cm (7-24in) this century, and by more if a thaw . of Greenland and Antarctica accelerates. Byrd Polar Research Center, pictured in 1960: Due to its location some 700 miles from the South Pole and near the center of the WAIS, Byrd Station is an important indicator of climate change throughout the region . Andrew Monaghan, study co-author and scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that the new findings place West Antarctica among the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The rise in temperatures in the remote region was comparable to that on the Antarctic Peninsula to the north, which snakes up towards South America, according to the U.S.-based experts writing in the journal Nature Geoscience. Parts of the northern hemisphere have also warmed at similarly fast rates. Several ice shelves - thick ice floating on the ocean and linked to land - have collapsed around the Antarctic Peninsula in recent years. Once ice shelves break up, glaciers pent up behind them can slide faster into the sea, raising water levels. Patchy data: Since its establishment in 1957, . Byrd Station hasn't always been occupied and even after it was automated . it has been subject to frequent power cuts, so . scientists were forced to reconstruct readings . 'We've already seen enhanced surface . melting contribute to the breakup of the Antarctic's Larsen B Ice Shelf, . where glaciers at the edge discharged massive sections of ice into the . ocean that contributed to sea level rise,' Dr Monaghan said. 'The stakes would be much higher if a similar event occurred to an ice shelf restraining one of the enormous WAIS glaciers.' We could refreeze the Arctic, and it wouldn't even cost that much, a scientist claims. Two recently published studies explore the possibility that a technological solution could be found to the problem of global warming melting the ice caps on the North Pole. The scientist who is lead author on both claims that 'any significant nation' could find the resources to carry out the operation. The only significant question, he says, is whether we should. The amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean shrank to an all time low in September (see graphic above), with the total area covered now half what it was in the Eighties. David Keith, professor of applied physics at Harvard University, is lead author on papers published in Nature Climate Change and Environmental Research Letters which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice. He used climate models to suggest\u00a0 injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth, engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the Arctic. His paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea-ice around the North Pole back to pre-industrial era levels. His second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified Gulfstream jets, costing somewhere in the region of $8billion a year. However, while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the Earth's atmosphere, he doesn't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest. Researchers consider the West . Antarctic ice sheet especially sensitive to climate change, explained . Ohio State University doctoral student Julien Nicolas. Since the base of the ice sheet rests below sea level, it is vulnerable to direct contact with warm ocean water. Its . melting currently contributes 0.3mm to sea level rise each year \u00e2\u20ac\u201d second to Greenland, whose contribution to sea level rise has been . estimated as high as 0.7mm per year. Due to its location some 700 miles . from the South Pole and near the center of the WAIS, Byrd Station is an . important indicator of climate change throughout the region. In the past, researchers haven't been able to make much use of the Byrd Station measurements. Data was often incomplete because nearly one third of the temperature observations were missing for the time period of the study. Since its establishment in 1957, the station hasn't always been occupied. A year-round automated station was installed in 1980, but it has experienced frequent power cuts, especially during the long polar night, when its solar panels can't recharge. Professor Bromwich and two of his graduate students, along with colleagues from NCAR and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, corrected the past Byrd temperature measurements and used corrected data from a computer atmospheric model and a numerical analysis method to fill in the missing observations. Aside from offering a more complete picture of warming in West Antarctica, the study suggests that if this warming trend continues, melting will become more extensive in the region in the future, Professor Bromwich said. While the researchers work to fully understand the cause of the summer warming at Byrd Station, the next step is clear, he added. 'West Antarctica is one of the most rapidly changing regions on Earth, but it is also one of the least known,' he said. 'Our study underscores the need for a reliable network of meteorological observations throughout West Antarctica, so that we can know what is happening\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand why\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwith more certainty.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "West Antarctica's rapid warming, recorded by the Byrd station, threatens a significant global sea level rise, potentially accelerated by ice shelf collapses.

A proposal suggests refreezing the Arctic as a potential solution to counteract global warming effects."}]}

Politicians can frequently be found on the phone, but in the hands of sexting offender Anthony Weiner the device is an unfortunate reminder of the dirty habits that have left his campaign with an uphill struggle in the polls. Maybe he was innocently checking his schedule, but Weiner really ought to keep his cell phone in his pocket when he\u2019s addressing the New York public which is rapidly losing faith in him since his latest sexting scandal broke last week. One poll earlier this week has Weiner, 48, falling from front-runner to fourth place in two weeks, with 65 percent of voters citing his behavior as a major issue for his campaign. What's going on here then? Anthony Weiner can't resist playing with his cell phone while he supposed to be canvassing for votes . You've got mail: Anthony Weiner remains transfixed on his phone during Wednesday's mayoral candidates forum . On Wednesday Weiner along with several other candidates, including Bill Thompson and John Liu, attended a New York City Mayoral Candidates Forum at La Marina Restaurant, 348 Dyckman Street. But Weiner\u2019s attention appeared to be elsewhere as he remained glued to his phone while his rivals spoke. He does of course have a lot on his mind, with Sydney Leathers basking in the spotlight following her sexting revelations and his spokeswoman Barbara Morgan launching an expletive-laden rant at an ex-intern who wrote an unflattering expose of his faltering campaign. Morgan remains adamant she won\u2019t quit her job despite her behavior, but the sexting business just won\u2019t go away. Even when Anthony Weiner puts his phone down he appears to remain preoccupied with it until he finally gets his turn to talk . Weiner finally gives his phone a break and addresses the audience and his rival candidates . Weiner was quizzed about his now notorious alias, Carlos Danger, on the campaign trail on Thursday. In his first live, on-air interview since news of his latest sexting scandal broke, Weiner told Univision\u2019s Satcha Pretto that the bizarre alias was 'a joke between [him] and one person' (Leathers) and that he would 'not comment on it' further. Mayoral rival Rev. Erick Salgado has taken umbrage with Weiner over his choice name. Salgado said it was an insult to the Latino community and has demanded that Weiner apologize, reports Fox News. The underfire NYC mayoral hopeful also said he was happy for his critics to continue to look into his shady past, reports ABC. 'If people want to continue to look at my background and make fun of things in my personal life, they are welcome to,' he told the Spanish-language television station. It is an offer that few can resist, including Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who shared his medical opinion this week that Weiner is 'psychologically unfit' to be the mayor of New York City. 'Congressman King never wanted me to become mayor. I fight with him every single step of the way [on immigration overhaul] just like I will when I\u2019m mayor. I\u2019m not looking for Peter King\u2019s vote. In fact, I\u2019d be a little ashamed if I had it,' was Weiner's response to Pretto.

Weiner's humiliated wife, have told People magazine that she began to . beat herself up because her husband returned to phone sex after they . stopped going to couple's therapy and their new baby began to take up . more of her time.

While Abedin's decision to stand by her shamed husband in the wake of last month's latest episode has disappointed many of her would-be supporters, her friends claim in People that she stayed with her cheating husband for the sake of their child and to 'help' her husband. 'She was seriously thinking, 'Maybe I can't do this.' There was the possibility of leaving on the table,' one family member told the magazine. 'It would have been perfectly logical if she had said, 'I'm out of here,' said family friend, Rory Tahari to the magazine. 'Any woman could have understood that.'

Their friends let People magazine know that former Hilary Clinton political aide Abedin's suffered huge doubt about their marriage during a Hamptons vacation one year ago. 'All the parties they had once been invited to, Huma was now invited to but Anthony wasn't,' a family member said. 'It was a difficult time.' However, the worst was yet to come. Just one month later after the Hampton's debacle, Weiner confessed that as their marriage deteriorated he had returned to sexting women lewd pictures of himself. He also confessed to frequent phone sex with 22-year-old Sydney Leathers and sending pictures of himself to two other women under the pseudonym Carlos Danger.

However, instead of leaving her husband, Abedin resolved to stay for the sake of their 19-month-old son. 'Huma has a very strong moral character, and she made a commitment for better or worse,' said Tahari. 'She never wanted Jordan to say to her, 'Why didn't you do everything you could to help Dad?' Despite her moral conviction to stay, friends and family have said that since the news broke of Weiner's continued sexting habit, Abedin has been trying to hide her tears from her son. 'He is the light in her life, and that's what she was focused on.

The suspect, Arid Uka, is a recently radicalized Muslim who seems to have been influenced by local radical Islamist websites, according to German authorities. Prosecutors say Uka shot and killed two U.S. servicemen and wounded two others in the attack Wednesday on a U.S. military bus at Frankfurt Airport. The arrest warrant for Uka lists two accusations of murder, three allegations of attempted murder and two accusations of causing severe bodily harm. The 21-year-old man said he was motivated to carry out the attack after seeing a video on the internet the day before, which he claimed showed U.S. soldiers raping Muslim women, according to a German intelligence official who viewed a record of the suspect's interrogation. The suspect confessed to the shooting, and said that he acted alone with no helpers, the German intelligence official said Thursday. He was friends on Facebook with several pro-al Qaeda extremists from a group based in Bonn, Germany, that is known to German intelligence officials, according to the official. He also had links to an Islamist preacher named Pierre Vogel and someone named Nessery, who was arrested about two months ago in Afghanistan, according to a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the investigation. The gunman was a postal worker at the airport, but worked outside the secure area. The U.S. official said Uka didn't appear to punch into work Wednesday -- having apparently canvassed the area beforehand, helping him get around the extensive uniformed and plain-clothes security that typically patrol the Frankfurt airport. Another U.S. official on Thursday said that Uka was \"not on the radar screen\" of American authorities prior to the attack. The suspect is from Mitrovica, a town in northern Kosovo, that country's interior minister, Bajram Rexhepi, told CNN. He cited the U.S. Embassy in Pristina as his source. The U.S. official with knowledge of the probe said Uka was a 1-year-old toddler when he moved to Germany, and that authorities believe Uka's relatives had suffered in the 1990s during the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanians. He has passports from both Germany and Yugoslavia, the latter of which was issued prior to Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008, Rexhepi said. Uka told interrogators that he lived with his family in high-rise public housing in a poor area of Frankfurt, the German intelligence official said. He said he did not have a friendly relationship with people in the neighborhood and did not interact with others there. He said his father was very strict and harsh with him, according to the official. On Wednesday, he allegedly approached a bus, which was parked outside Terminal 2 and was clearly marked as a U.S. military vehicle, German police said after the shooting. According to the warrant, Uka asked a recruit where he was being deployed. The airman replied that he and his comrades were headed to Afghanistan. Uka then shot him in the back of the head with a handgun. The suspect then entered the bus, screamed \"Alahu Akbar,\" and opened fire, killing the driver, the warrant says. Uka then shot two other passengers, wounding one in the head and the other in the chest, the warrant says. The suspect tried to shoot another serviceman but his gun jammed, it says. The suspect fled then fled into the terminal, where he was taken into custody by German federal police, according to the warrant. The suspect used a 9 mm handgun that was illegally purchased, Rhein said. One of the dead airmen was a vehicle operator at Ramstein, and the second was part of a security forces team based in the U.K., an Air Force spokesman said. The bus was occupied by 15 members of a security forces team that was on its way to Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany before deploying to Afghanistan, the spokesman said. Zachary Cuddeback was one of those killed, his grandfather, Daniel Cuddeback, told CNN. It's not clear if he was the vehicle operator or the member of the security forces team. A statement from his family described Cuddeback as a hockey player and \"Army brat\" with especially strong roots in Missouri in Virginia who joined the Air Force in 2009 after a year at Old Dominion University. The U.S. Defense Department on Thursday identified the other victim as Senior Airman Nicholas J. Alden, 25, of Williamston, South Carolina. He had been assigned to the 48th Security Forces Squadron based out of the Lakenheath air base in Great Britain. The two wounded airmen were in a Frankfurt hospital, one in critical condition and the other in serious condition, an Air Force spokesman said. President Barack Obama told reporters Wednesday he was \"saddened and outraged\" by the attack. \"We will spare no effort in learning how this outrageous attack took place,\" he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said how upset she was by the incident, expressed her condolences to the troops' families and stressed that Germany will \"do everything we can to try and find out quickly what happened.\" FBI agents were on the scene shortly after the shooting occurred, said Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director and CNN contributor. The FBI's main office in Germany is in the capital Berlin, he said, but it has a sub-office in Frankfurt. The offense is a federal crime both in the United States and in Germany, he said, and could be prosecuted in either location, although that will be determined later. However, the investigation will meet U.S. constitutional standards, he said. Authorities will be investigating the suspect's background and associates, likely subpoenaing telephone and e-mail records, Fuentes said.

Hadi had been under house arrest for a month after he resigned under pressure from Houthi rebels. But he escaped and released a statement saying he is still president, calling all political decisions made since September illegal and invalid. A nephew of the president was kidnapped Sunday by Houthi rebels, two security officials in Ibb province told CNN. The nephew, Nasser Ahmed Mansour Hadi, was heading to the seaport province of Aden, where the President fled after escaping from house arrest in the capital, Sanaa. Protesters called for Hadi to stand against the Houthi coup. Sanaa saw the largest demonstrations urging Hadi to end militant occupation of Sanaa. \"The Houthis thought they could not be stopped, and it only took hours for them to fall in the eyes of the people. Yemen has a president and the people will stand with him to uproot the Houthi militants from Sanaa,\" Ali Al-Saedi, a protest organizer in Sanaa, told CNN. In Taiz, tens of thousands took to the streets to show support for the legitimacy of the president and condemn the continued Houthi takeover of the capital. They carried placards reading \"Out to militant rule, return of government institutions.\" Last month, Houthis attacked the presidential palace and ministerial Cabinet, forcing both the president and prime minister to resign. Houthi militants then put Hadi under house arrest. Since then, Houthis have failed to form a government or reach a deal with other political factions for the formation of a presidential council. The militants tightened their grip on power over the last month, but the House of Representatives has not met to accept Hadi's resignation. Hours after Hadi fled Sanaa on Saturday, Houthi officials tried to force parliamentarians to meet immediately to accept his resignation, but their efforts failed. The ruling General People's Congress party, headed by Yemen's former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, which holds a majority of seats in parliament, said it will not push for a parliament vote to accept the resignation of Hadi. \"Hadi is the President of Yemen, since his resignation has yet to officially reach parliament. Yemen is still led by a constitutional elected president,\" said Abdul Aziz Jubari, the secretary general of the independent Justice and Building Party. Houthis are Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni Muslim country. They had been at war with the central government for more than a decade, but their entry into Sanaa in September brought things to a head, sparking battles that left than 300 people dead before a ceasefire was agreed to that month. Houthis then pressured Hadi to step down last month after he refused to agree to certain political demands. The Houthis' takeover of Sanaa stunned governments of Western nations, which pulled out diplomatic staff this month. As part of an investigation into Hadi's escape, Houthis on Saturday arrested dozens of their own security personnel who were responsible for watching him, a senior Houthi official said. Houthis arrested two people connected to Hadi -- his media secretary Yahya Al Arassi and his private physician -- after his escape, one of Hadi's advisers said. A senior official with a Sunni political party opposed to the Houthi takeover said that he backs Hadi's claim to the presidency. \"Hadi's withdrawal (of his resignation) would save the country and end the Houthi oppression of the Yemeni people,\" said Mohammed Al-Sabri, senior official of the Nasserite party. There already had been resistance to the Houthis' attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the South, where there's a long-running secessionist movement. Also opposed to the Houthis is the Sunni terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which exerts influence over many rural areas across the country. AQAP vowed to attack Houthi loyalists nationwide last year. Yemen's political turmoil could have an impact on the United States' fight against AQAP. The United States has long had a relationship with Yemen's leaders, working with them to target AQAP militants. It's not clear what the Houthis' takeover of Sanaa means for U.S. anti-terrorism efforts, but the drone program there still appears to be active. A U.S. drone strike killed senior AQAP cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari and three other people in Shabwa province on January 31.

Prime Minister David Cameron was due to speak at the conference but his attendance was cut short so he could focus on the flooding in southern England. Mr Cameron dropped in at the summit but did not pose with the delegates and the royals for a 'family photo', and met leaders behind the scenes. It is hoped that the nations will sign a declaration that will commit them to a range of goals to combat poaching and illegal trade in animal parts. In a short address Foreign Secretary William Hague outlined the steps the conference would agree to take to tackle the 'unprecedented crisis'. He said there was 'some evidence to show how insurgent or terrorist groups can benefit from the trade' in endangered species, but the conference would result in a 'powerful declaration that will demonstrate to the world that we will not tolerate this abhorrent trade'. Mr Hague said the countries represented would 'commit ourselves to treat poaching and trafficking as a serious, organised crime in the same category as drugs, arms or people trafficking'. He said: 'Poachers think they can act with impunity. We will show them they are wrong.'There should be no weak link, we will all seek out those who commit these atrocious acts and use the full force of our national and international laws to break these criminal empires.'

Dame Jane Goodall, a leading British primatologist, said she agreed the prince\u2019s timing was unfortunate, but added: \u2018The involvement of Prince William and Prince Charles has brought so much attention and it\u2019s so important, because some of these species are actually vanishing.\u2019"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Prince Charles, Prince William, and Prince Harry, attending the Illegal Wildlife Trade Conference, called for action against poaching, viewing a display of seized animal parts.

Hypertension, which can lead to strokes, heart attack, kidney failure and death, is traditionally treated with medication and diet. The goal of most doctors is to keep their patient's blood pressure below 140 (systolic) / 90 (diastolic). But after reviewing mounds of evidence, a committee of experts now says the systolic number, especially in older people, can be higher at 150/90. And many of these patients who were on medication would no longer need to be. It is not clear how many people would be affected by these new guidelines, but experts are estimating in the millions. The committee was asked to update the guidelines that have been in place for more than 30 years. They were published online Wednesday in the latest edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The group of 17 experts found no reason to change any other section of the guidelines.

Maxine Moss, 34, watched in horror as Jade's weight plummeted to a just 2st 13lbs - the same as an average four-year-old. Despite the warning signs, doctors labelled Jade, now 12, a 'picky eater'. Ms Moss, of Cannock, Staffordshire, said: 'I knew the signs because I'd suffered from anorexia as a child. I begged the doctors for help, but they maintained that Jade was too young to have an eating disorder. Helpless: Maxine Moss, 34, watched in horror as Jade's weight plummeted to a just 2st 13lbs - the same as an average four-year-old, after suffering from anorexia brought on by cruel taunts from classmates . The youngster's problems began in June 2012, after school bullies branded her 'fat' and 'ugly'. Upset, Jade began to feel body conscious and started to restrict her diet, secretly throwing food away. The mother-of-ten noticed her daughter's lack of appetite and spoke to Jade, who confided about her troubles at school. Ms Moss complained to teachers, who reprimanded the bullies with a verbal warning. She said: 'I told Jade not to listen to the bullies, but it was no use.' Jade continued to restrict her food intake and by September 2012, Maxine was forced to take her to the GP. Jade said: 'I knew I was getting skinny, but no matter how small I got, I still believed I was fat' But the doctor suggested Jade's lack of appetite was due to her being a 'picky eater'. A week later, she noticed Jade checking the calorie content on food packaging. Jade said: 'I knew I was getting skinny, but no matter how small I got, I still believed I was fat. 'When I brushed my hair, clumps would fall on to the carpet, and my skin was becoming flaky too.' Jade then started skipping dinner, claiming she'd already eaten at a friend's house. Ms Moss said: 'Jade now weighs a healthy five stone, but she missed months of school, and it's been difficult to catch up' At school, she was secretly throwing her lunch away, surviving on just a nibble of a biscuit. Ms Moss said: 'Even treats wouldn't tempt her. 'While her brothers and sisters ate chocolate cake for dessert, Jade would only manage an ice lolly. 'With nine children at home, it was tough to keep track of Jade's eating habits. 'I couldn't force her to eat and the doctors would do nothing. I felt helpless.' By October 2012, Jade's weight had dropped from 4st 7lbs to less than 3st, leaving her severely dehydrated and suffering liver and kidney failure. She struggled to walk, her face was gaunt and her clothes hung limply from her frail body. Her breathing was shallow and she felt faint all the time. Shockingly, Maxine could feel Jade's bones after checking her chest when she complained of pains. It was the last straw and the youngster was admitted to Stafford Hospital, where she was diagnosed with anorexia. With a BMI of just 9, Jade was dangerously underweight. She was assigned a dietician, who encouraged her to eat small mouthfuls of food. But after ten days of refusing to eat, Jade was still severely dehydrated and her organs were failing, so she was fed through a tube. Jade said: 'The doctors told mum that I was in danger of dying if I didn't eat something.' While ex-husband Graham, 41, looked after Jade's brothers and sisters, Thomas, 18, Callum, 13, Graham, 11, Calvin, 7, Ellie-Mae, 6, Summer, 4, Ocean, 3, Alex, 2, Maxine stayed by Jade's bedside. Ms Moss begged Jade to eat and even sneaked in Jade's favourite takeaway, crispy chicken and egg fried rice to encourage her. After 11 weeks, Jade started to eat small meals. Getting better: Jade with her friend Billy about to attend her school prom a couple of months after her feeding tube was removed . 'The first time she swallowed a piece of crispy chicken I wanted to cry - there was a chance my little girl would make it, she said' Jade's appetite slowly began to improve and she returned home in December 2012 weighing 3st 7lbs. For the next six months, she received home visits from nurses, who checked her weight and progress, as well as counselling sessions, which she continues to receive to this day. In January 2013 - seven months after she dropped out - Jade went back to school, but, too weak to walk, she relied on a wheelchair to get around. She could only manage small meals, so relied on her feeding tube and protein shakes for nutrition. Finally, in February 2013, Jade's feeding tube was removed. Ms Moss said: 'Jade now weighs a healthy five stone, but she missed months of school, and it's been difficult to catch up. 'It's taken us a year and a half to get here, but I'm so pleased to see my little girl smile again. 'I want other mums to know that no matter how young the child, an eating disorder can still take hold, even if they don't fully understand it themselves.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jade, daughter of Maxine Moss, developed anorexia due to school bullying.

Officers visited the home of Amar Khosah, 52, in Southampton when he was reported missing - but simply posted a note through his door. The body was only found when his sister broke in herself. A coroner said it was possible the man could have been saved had Hampshire Constabulary officers investigated properly, adding: \u2018The property could have been entered at any time.\u2019 Police have apologised, saying the officers involved had received \u2018refresher training\u2019 but should have checked the flat. They added that the probe was \u2018confused\u2019 and \u2018limited\u2019 but nobody was disciplined. Mr Khosah was reported missing on July 23 by a health worker after missing two appointments. Police called at his home several times and posted notes through his door - but never tried to get in. Family friend Fabian Nicholas told the inquest that Mr Khosah\u2019s sister Simbo had given officers permission to force their way in. But police said there was no record of permission being granted. The body was discovered on August 4 by his other sister, Amar Sameja, who had returned to her Southampton home from India on July 31. She broke into his flat and found him on his bed. The inquest at Southampton Coroner's Court comes less than two weeks after the same force apologised for failing deaf pensioner Marion Jones, 89, who dialled 999 after falling at home. Street; The body was discovered on August 4 by his sister, Amar Sameja, who had returned to her Southampton home from India on July 31. She broke into his flat on this road and found him on his bed . An officer from Hampshire Constabulary visited her home and simply left when she failed to answer the door. She was found dead inside five days later. 'We do have a situation where if the property had been entered he could have been found wholly unharmed' Coroner Keith Wiseman . Pathologist Dr Sanjay Jogai said Mr Khosah had died from an overdose of prescription painkiller tramadol. He believed the time of death was three to five days before the body was found. Coroner Keith Wiseman recorded an open verdict, saying it was unclear whether Mr Khosah had taken his own life intentionally or by mistake. He was critical of the police investigation, saying: \u2018The property could have been entered at any time from July 23 onwards. \u2018This becomes intriguing because if he . had not in fact died at that stage then we do have a situation where if . the property had been entered he could have been found wholly unharmed.\u2019 Hearing: The inquest at Southampton Coroner's Court (pictured) in Hampshire was told that Amar Khosah, 52, was reported missing on July 23 by a health worker after missing two appointments . The Investigations Standards Team and Hampshire Constabulary\u2019s Professional Standards Department reviewed how the case was handled. Both concluded there was \u2018confusion among officers\u2019 about the status of Mr Khosah\u2019s disappearance. 'It was clear officers had not applied the force's missing person policy correctly, that the investigation lacked ownership and consistency and that officers should have considered searching Mr Khosa\u2019s property earlier' Superintendent James Fulton, Hampshire Constabulary . The reviews said: \u2018Officers did not . exercise enough urgency. The investigation needed greater continuity and . control. The concerns of the mental health worker should have made . officers increase the risk factor.\u2019 Superintendent .

Otto Perez Molina, a retired army general who pledged to take a tough stand on crime, garnered the most votes in Sunday's elections. With almost all of the ballots counted Monday night, Perez Molina had 36% of votes -- far short of the more than 50% needed to win outright. His closest competitor, businessman Manuel Baldizon, had 23% of votes, said Guatemala's election authority. Observers from the Organization of American States criticized Guatemalan election officials' apparent disorganization and slow vote-counting after Sunday's election, the state-run AGN news agency reported. The watchdogs said they hoped the process would improve in the second round of voting, scheduled for November 6. Dealing with widespread violence and the growing threat of organized crime figured heavily in the campaigns of all 10 candidates vying for the presidency. Baldizon championed a crime-fighting plan called \"Security Now!\" Campaign posters for Perez Molina, who led in polls before Sunday's election, featured a clenched fist.  The 60-year-old retired general pledged to bring a \"mano dura\" -- firm hand -- to Guatemala's highest office. In a debate co-hosted by CNN en Espa\u00f1ol last month, Perez Molina called for \"elite units of the army\" to play a larger role in the nation's battle against gangs and drug cartels. But that proposed approach -- and Perez Molina's high rank in the military during Guatemala's decades-long civil war -- worries human rights groups both in Guatemala and abroad. \"These groups have begun questioning his military past and his participation in the war against the insurgents during the armed conflict. Undoubtedly, this issue will be present during his presidency if he wins the elections,\" said Miguel Castillo, a political analyst at Guatemala's Francisco Marroquin University. Concerns stem from the fact that the Guatemalan military committed multiple atrocities during the civil war, though Perez Molina has never been directly implicated in any of them, Castillo said. Perez Molina is campaigning for president for a second time. He was defeated in 2007 by incumbent President Alvaro Colom. \"We would have liked to win in the first round, but we are prepared with a revision of plans and strategy to face the second phase of this electoral process,\" he said early Monday, according to AGN. First-time candidate Baldizon, 41, also said he was ready for the next round, AGN reported. The businessman and attorney, who is running under the banner of the Leader Party, has energized young people. His campaign slogan was \"Only the people can save the people.\" The youngest of all the candidates, Baldizon espouses a concept he calls \"renewed democratic liberty\" in which all members of society have a role to play in seeking solutions to common problems. \"In order to change Guatemala, we need a president who's really committed to our nation, with a calling for service, and who truly wants to change Guatemala,\" Baldizon said. Poverty is endemic in Guatemala, and the country has one of the worst crime rates in Latin America. Forty-three percent of children under 5 are chronically malnourished. And the murder rate last year was 42 per 100,000 people -- one of the highest in the world. In a Vox Latina national survey in July, more than two-thirds of Guatemalans said violence was the issue that concerned them most, far outpacing the combined totals for the economy, unemployment, poverty and lack of education. This is only the fourth time that Guatemala has held presidential elections since peace accords were signed in 1996, officially ending a civil war that devastated the Central American country for 36 years. The conflict left more than 100,000 people dead and a million refugees. The new president will take office in January. CNN's Fernando del Rincon, Rafael Romo and Arthur Brice, and journalist Patzy Vasquez contributed to this report."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Guatemala's presidential runoff is between Otto Perez Molina, scrutinized for his military past, and Manuel Baldizon, who rallied youth with his slogan.

The child, who has not been named, narrowly topped the list of the most obese children in Coventry and Warwickshire, where the data was collected. The Year 6 pupil tipped the scales at 19st 7lbs, making them one of the heaviest children in the country. Another child of the same year weighed just over 18st, a third weighed 18st 6lbs and a fourth weighed 16st 7lbs. Shocking: The 10-year-old child, who has not been named, is one of the fattest children in the country (file picture) The children were weighed at school as part of an annual child measurement programme and it is now known if they were male or female. The latest data has been supplied by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, the official source of NHS data. Coventry City Council estimates there are about 10,000 primary school children in the area who are classed as either overweight or clinically obese - including a handful of local youngsters who weighed in at more than 16st during health checks in Year 6. Many will grow to become obese adults, increasing their risk of diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, cancer and other killer diseases. National figures released by the Health and Social Care Information Centre in December revealed the proportion of Year 6 primary school children who are obese or overweight had actually fallen for the first time in six years. A third of Year 6 pupils - 33.3 per cent - . measured for the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in 2012/13 . were obese or overweight, compared to 33.9 per cent in the previous . year. In Reception, the number of obese and . overweight children also fell in 2012/13 compared to the previous year . and is lower than seven years ago. And . in December, it was revealed a ten-year-old schoolgirl in Birmingham . weighed at 22 stone 11lbs, closely followed by six youngsters of the . same age who weighed 19 stone. Tam . Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, told MailOnline: 'It is a truly . horrific problem we have. The Government says obesity is falling in . children, which it might be in affluent areas. Denial: Experts say many parents believe nothing needs to be done about their overweight children - because they 'look healthy and happy' 'But in many cases, it's about volume - fat people are getting fatter. Also, many parents don't realise their child is overweight - quite often because they are fat themselves. 'It is horrific figures such as these which show just how big the problem of childhood obesity is becoming.' Berni Lee, public health consultant for Coventry City Council, said the main challenge is changing the attitudes of parents with overweight children who believe nothing needs to be done because theirchild looks healthy and happy. A recent survey suggests most parents ignore advice offered by the National Child Measurement Programme. She added: 'We\u2019ve become accustomed to the overweight because it\u2019s so common in our society. 'We are not recognising it when we see it because people only hear about the extreme cases, people think it\u2019s an extreme state. 'The 19-and-a-half stone child is not the problem, although it\u2019s a problem for them. 'The problem is the [other] children...who are either overweight\u00a0 or very overweight.

A spokesman at Warwickshire County Council said: 'Children identified as overweight or obese through the programme are pro-actively offered weight management support. 'There are protocols in place to ensure that the family/carer receive an individual child\u2019s results within three weeks of being weighed and measured. 'Up to three weeks after this, the school health team\u2019s Family Change4Life Advisory Service will telephone the family and offer weight management support.

Passed away: Zac Knighton-Smith, pictured, passed away on New Year's Day . A boy who spent more than half his young life has died after a battle with the same rare brain cancer which killed his cousin. Zac Knighton-Smith, nine, passed away on New Year's Day from an agressive neuroblastoma. He had been diagnosed with the condition in February 2009, aged four. And just six months after the diagnosis his cousin, Chelsea Knighton, died from the condition aged three. When he first fell ill aged four, two doctors missed the symptoms of his cancer. It took six months to diagnose him as suffering from a form of the disease called neuroblastoma, which affects the developing nerve cells of children. After chemotherapy at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2009, the NHS paid for Zac to go to Germany for a first time to have antibody therapy. While there, doctors removed a tumour near his heart which, incredibly, his family had not even been told about. Zac was given the all-clear, but a follow-up scan revealed three cancerous lymph nodes in his abdomen. The NHS originally refused to fund potential lifesaving surgery at a German hospital for Zac, from Rushden, Northamptonshire, which led his family to start a desperate fundraising campaign. They found the \u00c2\u00a38,000 needed for the operation, and were delighted to be told in March 2011 that Zac was in remission. The family were also reimbursed the cost of the treatment by the NHS after Conservative MP Peter Bone intervened on their behalf. Packed up: Zac, pictured in 2012 with his parents Bob Smith and Sam Knighton before his trip to Germany . Following intervention from their local Tory MP Peter Bone the NHS did a U-turn and reimbursed the family for the costly treatment. But the cancer later spread to Zac's liver and he passed away at his home on 1 January alongside his parents, Bob Smith, 44, and Sam Knighton, 45. Diagnoses: Zac, right, with his cousin Chelsea, after both had been diagnosed with neuorblastomata . His mother yesterday said he wasn't in any pain but confirmed his health had been ailing because the disease had spread to his liver. Ms Knighton said: 'We took him to America as our last-ditch attempt in November to a specialist oncologist, who was also a scientist. We found out then it had spread to his bone marrow. 'We knew then that we had one hell of a fight. But at that point it wasn't in his liver. But that's the nature of the disease, it can happen that quickly. 'All over Christmas he deteriorated. We knew he didn't have long, he was poorly. Christmas will never be the same again.' Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Bone said Zac will be 'greatly missed'. Addressing Commons Leader Andrew Lansley in the chamber, he said: This lovely, full-of-life, happy little boy passed away. He will be sadly and greatly missed. 'However, without politicians of different parties working together he would not have had the last five years.' Any funds raised by Zac's Fight Appeal, which has been raising money for his treatment, will now be used to help other children and their families fighting the disease. Ms Knighton added: 'This country offers nothing for relapse neuroblastoma. If you take accidents out of the equation, this disease is the single biggest killer of children. 'How many more children have to die before something is done about it? This can't be allowed to happen.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Zac Knighton-Smith, a neuroblastoma victim, had treatment in Germany funded by a family campaign and later reimbursed by the NHS due to MP Peter Bone's intervention.

A Spanish team reported the eclipsing of a star system, known as MY Camelopardalis, when they saw two huge stars circle in a very close orbit. The star system is nestled within a small open star cluster, named Alicante 1, located about 13,000 light-years from Earth. Astronomers have spotted two monster stars about to merge in a stunning event that could reveal, for the first time, how supermassive stars are born (artist's impression pictured) Our sun is a relatively rare star in its isolation. Most of the stars in our galaxy have been formed in binary or multiple systems, some of which are \u2018eclipsing\u2019. Currently, the stars in My Cam are moving around each other at speeds of 621,000 miles (1 million km) per hour and are estimated to be no more than two million years old. Each has a radius around 700 times bigger than the Earth's, but turns on itself at about the same time. By watching the two stars with the 7.2ft (2.2 metre) telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory, researchers were able to find out the temperature and shape of each of the stars. By watching the two stars with a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory, researchers were able to find out the temperature and shape of each of the stars. Pictured is an artist's impression of a binary star system . The stars, which each have 38 and 32 times the mass of our sun, are also thought to complete orbits of each other in under 1.2 days. This means that their outer atmospheres are already touching and interacting, and are so close to each other that scientists believe they will eventually merge into one. The resulting star is estimated to have at least 60 times the mass of the sun, according to the study by the University of Alicante. Galaxies like our Milky Way are made up of stars, dust and dark matter bound together by gravity. As galaxies drift through space, they periodically crash into each other.Stars and the other galactic stuff can merge together in these mash-ups . You can call them celestial orphans, stars flung out of their galaxies in colossal collisions that have occurred in space for billions of years. These forsaken stars may be far more common than anyone ever realised. New observations from suborbital rocket launches and an orbiting observatory show that as many as half the stars in the universe may be this kind, scientists said in November. They found that the dim light these stars produce from the far reaches of the cosmos equals the amount coming from all the galaxies. The data was collected during 2010 and 2012 flights of a Nasa suborbital rocket with the Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment (Ciber) measuring background fluctuations in a compilation of all the light emitted by stars and galaxies in the universe's history. The researchers then checked the findings using Spitzer Space Telescope, an orbiting infrared observatory. The data indicated huge numbers of orphan stars, previously undetected, populate what had been thought to be the dark spaces between galaxies. So how did billions of stars become orphans? Violently, to say the least. Galaxies like our Milky Way are made up of stars, dust and dark matter bound together by gravity. As galaxies drift through space, they periodically crash into each other. Stars and the other galactic stuff can merge together in these mash-ups, but some stars that were born and resided in these galaxies are stripped away and cast as debris into the cosmic wilderness. The phenomenon of the orphan star has been well known. Astronomers have witnessed tidal streams of stars being stripped away from colliding pairs of galaxies. Scientists are unsure what will happen next, but any merger is likely to be rapid and explosive, releasing massive amounts of energy. While it won\u2019t create a \u2018hypergiant\u2019 star, astrophysicists hope that by seeing the merger of such close binary stars, they can better explain how extremely massive stars form. Hypergiants may be 100 or more times more massive than the sun, and emit hundreds of thousands of times more energy. Although extreme stars such as these are believed to have been common in the early universe, today they are extremely rare - the entire Milky Way galaxy contains only a handful."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Calar Alto Observatory is monitoring two stars in MY Camelopardalis, a binary system, on the brink of merging.

Ms Williams, 33, said: \u2018It\u2019s amazing that Gareth has done this for Luca at the same time he has become the most valuable footballer ever. \u2018He has given our campaign a huge boost and just goes to show what a lovely lad Gareth is.\u2019 Gareth Bale is not the first football star to join the \u2018For Luca\u2019 campaign - Maradona wrote the slogan on his hand and posted the picture onto the website as well. Formula One driver Sebastian Vettel, England cricketer Stuart Broad, British Lions captain Sam Warburton, film star Mickey Rourke, pop stars Olly Murs and Pixie Lott and Jamie and Louise Redknapp have also signed up. Luca developed meningitis when he was three. He spent two weeks in intensive care and had to have surgery to amputate both of his legs . Luca displayed no signs of being ill when his parents put him to bed, but when they later checked on him, he was covered in a red rash so they rushed him to hospital where he was diagnosed with meningitis . One supporter even risked his job last year as he tried to get a picture of president Barack Obama while he held his hand up scrawled with the words 'For Luca'. Dai Baker, 39, an award-winning cameraman, who works for Channel 4 News, was told about the initiative by his brother, who is a friend of Luca\u2019s parents. Mr Baker was invited to the Oval Office to have his photo taken with the president after winning a number of prizes for his images. Celebrities, including Micky Mouse (pictured), Holly Valance, Olly Murs and Stuart Broad, have joined the campaign to help Luca. So far, it has raised \u00a3225,000 . The 'For Luca' campaign was launched last year and has attracted attention from around the world. Image shows England cricketer, Stuart Broad, with 'For Luca' written on his hand . While he was there, he took the quick picture in support of Luca. The campaign has so far raised nearly \u00a3225,000. Luca almost died from meningococcal septicaemia when he was three, and after two weeks in intensive care surgeons had to amputate both his legs. He showed no sign of being unwell when his parents put him to bed one evening but, when they checked on him during the night, they found he had developed a rash and his entire body had turned purple. Mr Syed, Luca's father, said: 'Luca is an inspiration to us every day. The courage he has shown has kept us positive and made us proud.'

They rushed him to hospital where doctors diagnosed him with meningococcal septicaemia, and he was given a number of treatments to replace lost fluids and blood. The youngster slowly started to show signs of improvement, but the disease had ravaged his body, leaving him black from his hips to his toes. Doctors took the decision to operate to remove his lower legs taking away all of the tissue and skin below his hips.

Price: \u00a339.99 / $63.00 (RRP) She is one of the most iconic characters in video games. Her first outing on the PlayStation signalling the beginning of a new generation of gaming. Now, as the life of current gen starts to fade, who better than Lara Croft to celebrate the end of an era and offer us a glimpse of what's to come. But this is no 'normal' Tomb Raider, and Crystal Dynamics have worked tirelessly to reboot the series. Perhaps their biggest statement of intent is getting Terry Pratchett's daughter, Rhianna, to pen the story. Birth of an icon: All alone and battling the elements, Lara is ambushed by wolves early on in the game . As such, Lara is part of a team of archeologists that washes up on an island after a storm destroys their ship. Isolated and all alone, it's not long before Lara bumps into a bunch of crazed Sun God-worshipping locals called the Solari who are killing any 'outsiders' in an attempt to bring their deity back. How Lara deals with these obstacles help mould her from from naive, timid archeologist to gun-wielding femme fatale. It's a breathless ride from start to finish, broken up with set pieces that give the Uncharted games a run for their money. However, some may feel the whole 'you can do it, Lara' theme (primarily from Lara's mentor, Roth) and constant sign-posting is a tad strong. Still, this feels like a Tomb Raider game, albeit with a few welcome modifications. As the game progresses, Lara can upgrade her equipment and skills. These range from combat upgrades such as the ability to throw dirt in enemies' eyes, to enhanced survival instincts that improve salvage and hunting ability. Levels are well deigned, too, offering a surprising level of freedom in some parts. Often venturing off the beaten track rewards you with a secret tomb which can be explored for ancient treasures. It's a living, breathing island too. Hungry wolves roam the forest at night, while timid rabbits and deer can be seen grazing on the island's lush greenery. The game lets you hunt all of these, but it feels more like an optional extra than something necessary for her survival. Shine a light: When exploring dark caves and tombs, Lara can light a torch to help illuminate her path. When climbing ladders, though, Lara does not extinguish the torch and flames cover her face. Thankfully, this amusing feature does not cause her any damage . Combat is fast and frantic and the formidable enemy AI is a challenge whatever the difficulty. Lara has a variety of weapons available to her ranging from shotguns to assault rifles and pistols. By far the most fun to use is the bow (later modifications make it even better). It's brilliantly rewarding watching a well-placed arrow hit a foe - a grisly death animation shortly following. But the graphic deaths are not just for your foes, and - in similar vein to the previous games - Lara can meet her end in a number of gruesome ways. Whether it's being crushed by a rock, impaled on a spike or eaten by wolves, all are particularly disturbing given how realistically Lara is portrayed. This is thanks to actress Camilla Luddington, who conveys Lara's transformation brilliantly. She's sobbing her eyes out one minute, then boisterously taunting her foes the next. The developers have mentioned their admiration of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboot, and this influence is clear throughout - both in the in-game cinematography and the dark, tense orchestral score. Some gameplay decisions, however, may jar with fans. Although Crystal Dynamics have placed the odd puzzle here and there, this is very much an action game. Indeed, Lara's kill count by the end of the game reaches genocidal proportions, which may make her 'transformation' feel less believable. Run and gun: In fire fights, it pays to keep moving. If you stay in one place, enemies will throw firebombs and dynamite to flush you out from cover . Graphically, the game is strong - with impressive detail on even the most distant environmental features. Pop up is negligible and there's enough variation (although earlier levels are perhaps too dark) to keep the adventure from feeling stale. But it's Lara's animation that steals the show. What starts as cautious footsteps and clumsy clambering soon turns into graceful rock climbing and death-defying leaps. Not all of it is silky smooth, but more often than not it looks fantastic. Lara's facial animations, too, capture every drop of her initial doubt and anxiety, only to subtly become more confident and aggressive as the game goes on. Naturally, the game looks its best on PC. On 'Ultimate' settings, textures are eye-poppingly realistic, and draw distances put consoles to shame. Most notable, though, is Lara's hair. Gone are her blocky locks, replaced by a free-flowing, insanely realistic head of hair made possible by TressFx. The campaign offers between 8-10 hours or gameplay, and multiplayer adds some more longevity. However, although competent, multiplayer is not why you buy a Tomb Raider game. You buy it for the story and in that respect, Tomb Raider delivers in almost every way. Tomb Raider is out now. WATCH THE VIDEO REVIEW HERE: .

Police investigating the fatal shooting of a security guard in Sydney four years ago say they know who was responsible and they are close to making an arrest. Gary Allibon, a 59-year-old security guard, was shot in the back during the armed robbery of a cash delivery van in the Sydney CBD on June 7, 2010. Today, on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the crime, detectives from the Robbery and Serious Crime Squad's Strike Force Lorimer have announced they have made a number of important breakthroughs in the case. 'We believe we know who is responsible for this offence and we are very close to being able to charge those people with the offence,' Detective Superintendent Luke Moore told a press conference. Police have been able to forensically link a vehicle used in the shooting of Mr Allibon \u2013 a stolen Audie S8 sedan \u2013 and the non-fatal shooting of a man in Wentworthville in April 2009. They have also identified another two cars that were involved in the crime, a white BMW X5, which has not yet been located, and a silver 2004 BMW 5-Series sedan, which was stolen during a violent car-jacking in Maroubra in July 2009. The breakthroughs were the result of scientific and technological advances and information provided to police by members of the public since 2010. Scroll down for video .

'I thought at four o'clock [this morning] when I woke up \u2013 four years ago I was happy, four years ago today I was happy,' she said. Mrs Allibon revealed that she met Gary, whom she described as 'a really nice guy' just six months after her previous partner had died, and they 'just gelled'. 'My husband was killed by someone who can only be described as a cold-blooded murderer,' she said. Mrs Allibon said that today was a particularly sad day in the lead up to the anniversary of Gary's death, which she will be marking tomorrow by having a mass said and then going to brunch with family. 'The murder of someone you love changes your life forever. I feel as empty today as I did the day of his death.' She added that there is never a day that goes past that she does not think of her husband and said that every time she sees a news report about a murder she is forced to relive her own loss. Detective Superintendent Moore said they still needed 'little pieces of information' before they could arrest the suspects and he called on the public to report any information they had about the crime to police so they could 'give Monica and her family the answers they deserve for the senseless death of Gary Allibon.' The crime occurred when Mr Allibon and another security guard were confronted by a group of armed men when they entered the foyer of a building on Sussex Street. Mr Allibon was shot in the back and the group stole some cash form the guards and fled in the silver Audi S8 sedan. Mr Allibon was treated at the scene before he was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital but died later. Detective Superintendent Moore called those involved in the crime 'well-organised' and 'cold-blooded' and said they were suspected of having links to known organised crime groups. Mr Allibon's widow, Monica, also addressed the press conference. She said she was happy with the progress police had made. She added that things had been 'difficult' and she was constantly reminded of her husband's death.

Hidden public service cuts will drain Britain's poorest families of 30 per cent of their annual income by 2017, as the coalition's tough spending targets begin to bite, new TUC research reveals. It said reductions in benefits and family tax credits, combined with continuing cuts to welfare, will 'cause considerable financial harm for millions of families'. The dire predictions come as chancellor George Osborne prepares to deliver his autumn statement on December 5, in which he is expected to detail a further \u00a310bn of welfare savings over the next five years. 'Unless George Osborne changes course,' the TUC warned. 'These cuts will be dwarfed by massive reductions in public services.' Their figures revealed that by 2016-17, the cumulative cost of lost public services for the poorest ten per cent of household will be \u00a33,995 in cash terms - or 31.7 per cent of their average annual income. By contrast, the top tenth of the income scale will lose just \u00a32,805 - or 2.5 per cent of annual income. This is because higher earners may use public transport less frequently, opt out of public schooling or healthcare, and less likely to rely on Sure Start centres. The analysis also said that the average household had already lost more than \u00a31,200 in public services but the real pain is still to come - this is just a third of the cuts they are likely to experience by 2014-2015. The TUC report coincided with a study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which found that 6.1m people in working households live in poverty and more than 5.1m people live in working age households where no one has a job. Julia Unwin, the foundation's chief executive, told The Observer: 'The most distinctive characteristic of poverty today is the very high number of working people who are also poor.' Against the cuts: Protesters take part in a TUC march against the welfare cuts. Research by the Congress suggests that the poorest families could lose 30 per cent of their income as public services are withdrawn . Nick Davies, policy director at Children England, said on the scaling back back of children's services: 'Demand has increased, but funding reduced, and that has led to the withdrawal of some services and the rationing of others. 'Local authorities have to focus on their statutory responsibilities and other things get neglected.' Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, added: 'We are hearing reports from welfare rights advisers up and down the country that the services they provide are being cut or closed down.

But now that we've had a chance to give it a spin, we can definitely say it's a fun, convenient alternative to other system unlocking methods. In a nutshell, you choose a photo for your lock screen, and then define three touch gestures to draw on top of the photo in order to unlock your device. When Microsoft first detailed picture password, some were skeptical: Won't evil hackers be able to figure out your gesture-based password based on the smudges you leave on the display? In a blog post, Microsoft said no: \"Because the order of gestures, their direction and location all matter, it makes the prospect of guessing the correct gesture set based on smudging very difficult even in the completely clean screen case, let alone on a screen that sees regular touch use.\" In that same blog post, Microsoft provided a detailed mathematical explanation of why a picture-based password is every bit as secure, if not more so, than a PIN-based one. And independent security experts agree that the likelihood of someone being able to decipher the intent of smudges on your device is slim to none. Of course, character-based passwords and number-based PINs are an old standby. Apple uses four-number passcodes in iOS. They're quite secure, but not particularly innovative. Google is more creative with its unlock security, offering a facial recognition-based unlocking feature in its Android 4 Ice Cream Sandwich OS. This, however, has proven not to be so secure. In fact, it can be defeated if you hold up a picture of the Android device owner at the right distance from the display. Easy gesture-based app switching . In the Ice Cream Sandwich version of Android, Google has added a \"Recent Apps\" feature that pulls up a listing of most frequently used apps when you click the system bar icon. But in Windows 8, switching between open apps is much more intuitive and easy: A swipe from the left edge of the device will immediately pull up the last app you used (assuming it's still open in a multitasking state). It's a natural gesture, and one you'll rarely use by accident. And best of all, it's fast \u2014 like channel surfing for the tablet era. And how's this for clever: If you know you have a large number of apps open, you can simply swipe back and forth on the edge of the screen, and up pops a vertical array of preview windows revealing all your running programs (see screenshot above). From here, you can tap on a preview to jump to a specific app. Again: another solution that's easy, quick and elegant. In the iPad version of iOS 5, you're given two strategies to jump between apps. Most people will double-tap the home button to reveal a lineup of icons of all open apps. From there, a simple icon tap will jump to the new app. That's the popular method. But iOS 5 for iPad also lets you swipe from open app to open app, much like the method in Windows 8. But there is one hitch in the iOS approach: You have to use a full four fingers to execute the swipe. Compared to the Windows 8 gesture, it's just not that natural. Fat fingers aren't a problem . One problem many mobile users suffer is that onscreen keyboards aren't designed for a variety of hand and finger sizes. This is typically less of a problem on tablets, which usually have enough screen real estate to offer accommodating keyboards. Nonetheless, if you plan on using your tablet two-handed, typing with your thumbs, typing on a tablet isn't so easy. Windows 8 offers a solution: It provides a split-screen keyboard so you can type with your thumbs. But wait, you say \u2014 Apple already does this in iOS 5. This is true, but Windows 8 goes one step further: You can adjust key size in the Windows 8 split-screen keyboard. You have three sizes to choose from, so if you've got the petite hands of a five-year-old, you can type on the small setting, and if you've got manly man hands, you can increase key size to large. It's not an insanely revolutionary feature, but little UI nuances like this make Windows 8 so appealing in total. Chromeless, fullscreen app experiences . Windows 8 also innovates with a unique, tablet-optimized approach that eliminates distracting \"chrome\" \u2014 in other words, all those busy interface elements that can junk up a desktop or app interface. In fact, it's an OS-wide theme of Windows 8\u2032s Metro UI. There are no menu bars, task bars, or navigational buttons permanently pinned to the display. In many iOS apps, you'll find navigational buttons that persist across the app's entire user experience. And even for apps that don't do this, you'll often still see that thin bar at the top of the screen that shows data connection strength, the time, and battery level. These are the very same elements that are locked to the iOS home screen. The case is similar (and arguably worse) in Ice Cream Sandwich. You've got your three virtual navigation buttons at the bottom of the display that are persistent across the UI. You also often have a bar across the top of the screen (just like in iOS) that displays battery status, time, and icons that link to other information. Windows 8 does away with all of this. To see the time, battery strength and data connectivity, you swipe open your Charms menu. Once you're done looking at these simple reports, you touch anywhere on the screen, and the Charms menu disappears. When I was younger, I was obsessed with knowing the time, so the new Windows 8 approach would have driven me nuts. But now it's liberating to keep the clock out of view \u2014 until I actually need it. Just check the time when you need to, and enjoy a much less busy user interface for 99 percent of your time on the tablet. Metro apps can luxuriously take up your tablet's full screen, and in cases where there's photo or video involved, that's fantastic. Home screen style and utility . Every major mobile OS provides a certain degree of personalization in what you see in your home screen. In iOS, you can rearrange your home screen app icons so you can put your favorite ones front and center. In Android, you can organize the placement of app icons, and also add widgets that display real-time information, making the home screen both personalized and a source of useful information. However, Android widgets tend to have their own developer-specific themes and designs, so when they intermingle on your home screen, the resulting arrangement may look busy and inconsistent like a chaotic patchwork quilt. In Windows 8, however, you'll find a happy medium between the tidy organization that iOS provides, and the freedom and utility of the Android home screen. In Windows 8, app icons are live tiles, either square or rectangular in shape, but always consistent in their basic look and feel. But live tiles also update with new information in real time, just like an Android widget. For example, the mail app provides a constant refresh of your latest message headers. You can organize live tiles in whatever order suits you best. In the screenshot above, we put the calendar, mail and weather apps on the far left so we could glean that information with a single downward glance. See the original article on WIRED .

From weepy ballads to stirring instrumentals, many pieces of music have been described as powerful or moving. But now there\u2019s a musical instrument that actually generates power when it is played - and it could provide light in poor and remote communities. The percussion shaker, called Spark, generates electricity that can charge a phone, or power a lamp after just 12 minutes of movement. Scroll down for video . A bright idea: A musical instrument called Spark (pictured) generates power when it is played, and 12 minutes of shaking generates enough power to light a home for an hour, or to charge a phone. It has a USB port so that a lighting strip can be attached (also pictured) When Spark is shaken, a magnet moves backwards and forwards through the centre of a solenoid - a coil of copper wire. A current is induced in the loops of wire and each time the magnet slides through, it charges up a rechargeable battery. Because the energy is stored, Spark can be played in the morning and the electricity generated, used later in the dark. Around 12 minutes of shaking generates enough power to light someone\u2019s home for an hour. It is the brainchild of Sudha Kheterpal, who has been a percussionist with dance band Faithless for 15 years. She hopes her innovation - which she\u2019s raising money to put into production on crowd funding site Kickstarter \u2013 will improves the lives of people in Kenya, where three quarters of the population have no access to electricity. The heart-shaped instrument is full of beads that make a noise when shaken, but play an important electricity-generating role, as well as making noise. The motion forces a magnet to move through a copper coil to make a current, which charges up a battery. More than 12 minutes of shaking can light up someone\u2019s home for an hour. \u2018I've tested the prototype with a number . of different communities in Kenya and have proven it is incredibly . useful to people. Children, teachers and village elders have all . embraced it,\u2019 she wrote on Kickstarter. The heart-shaped instrument is full of beads that make a noise when shaken, but also play an important electricity-generating role. It has been trialled in Kenya (pictured) and its creator hopes Spark will let children do homework when it is dark and charge phones to connect families and communities . A USB port on the side of the Spark allows people to charge a mobile phone or plug in a lamp, and during tests in Kenya, this proved to be safer than using a kerosene lamp. \u2018During testing, the people who used Spark said it was useful because they had light in the evenings which they used for doing homework, household chores and for lighting their way home in the dark,\u2019 Kheterpal continued. \u2018Spark will enable children and their families to be safer by eliminating the need of kerosene for light for example, and by providing light for women and girls in areas where rape is a huge problem.\u2019 The design is based on the shape of a heart, but it gets its geometric look because Kheterpal was also inspired by flint stones, which are used to create a spark and \u2018give birth to a powerful new source of energy.' So far, just over half of the money required to ship 1,000 Sparks to Kenya has been raised and people can buy t-shirts, tickets to a special Faithless concert as well as a Spark assembly kit, for \u00a3150, which will be manufactured next year."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Faithless's Sudha Kheterpal created Spark, an electricity-generating shaker.

The issue was raised after Gareth Williams was told by nurses that patients on his mother's ward at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales were being given powerful sedatives without prescription. Mr Williams was told what was happening by a whistleblowing nurse before the death of his 82-year-old mother Lillian Williams. It has already been admitted in her case during\u00a0Protection of Vulnerable Adults investigation into her death. Mrs Williams, a mother-of-five who was left with one leg after an amputation, died 15 months ago after a catalogue of neglect at the hospital, which is part of the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University local health board. An investigation has been launched at the Princess of Wales Hospital into claims that nurses drugged elderly and vulnerable patients without prescription or consent in order to make sure they had an 'easy night shift' In the wake of her case, police have referred criminal charges against nurses at the hospital for\u00a0allegedly giving sedatives to vulnerable patients without prescription or consent. Mr Williams said: 'A nurse told me she had witnessed patients regularly being given unnecessary sedation without prescription at night to make life easier for the night shift team. 'I told nurses I had been promised by my mother's doctor she would not be sedated without consent or prescription. 'They said it is alright for them to promise the impossible and then walk off but we have to cope with them all night. 'A nurse told us many of the people being sedated are very ill and very frail and if you give them the wrong drug it could kill them.' The hospital is already at the centre of a major police investigation with five nurses charged with falsifying medical records and willful neglect. Richard Baker, a barrister who represented families at the inquiry into appalling care and high death rates at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Trust, said that using drugs without the consent of patients so staff could have a quiet night would be inappropriate. He said: 'The use of drugs inappropriately, in patients who could not offer consent would also be wrong. Administering medication to sedate patients so that staff could have a quiet night would be an inappropriate use of that medication. 'Both would be gross breaches of nursing and clinical standards and would likely lead to disciplinary action. 'As to seriousness, it would evidently have the potential to end the careers of the people involved.' The allegations came to light after a nurse told Gareth Williams his mother Lillian Williams, 82, was one of a number of patients being given powerful sedatives without consent or prescription at the hospital . Mr Williams said the nurse said she'd seen patients on his mother's ward given drugs without prescription . Welsh Assembly Member Bethan Jenkins has written to Ed Beltrami, the Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS in Wales, to ask him to speed up the process of reviewing the evidence and to bring charges. She said police had been investigating since Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) admitted that Mrs Williams was 'sedated unnecessarily without consent'. Ms Jenkins, Plaid Cymru AM for South Wales West, said a whistleblower nurse working for the health board had approached Mrs Williams' family and told them that 'for years she has witnessed night staff on Ward 6 sedating elderly vulnerable patients without prescription'. Ms Jenkins said the family had been involved in a 'protracted battle' to get an answer about what happened to their mother. She said:\u00a0'So naturally they are at a loss to understand why it has taken 16 months for the police to investigate and why there is not yet a decision from the CPS as to whether these admissions of very serious abuses and neglects amount to crimes. 'They believe - as do I - that 16 months is ample time to investigate and come to a decision. Bereaved families need closure, and the delays in this investigation are only putting off that day.' Helen Rundle, a lawyer leading calls for a public inquiry into allegations of abuse in the Welsh NHS, said a decision on charges by the CPS would be made in the next few weeks. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: 'South Wales Police is investigating complaints regarding the quality of care provided to Lilian Williams whilst she was an in-patient at both The Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend and Neath Port Talbot Hospital during 2010 and 2012 respectively. 'Whilst the CPS has been in contact with South Wales Police in relation to this aspect of the investigation, we have not been asked to provide formal charging advice. In mid-November, the CPS received a report from South Wales Police seeking observations on their findings and the content of that report is currently under consideration. 'We have recently received correspondence on this matter from elected Assembly Members and representatives of the victim's family. It would be therefore be inappropriate for us to comment further before we have responded directly to these enquiries.' A spokesman for the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board said they were cooperating with the ongoing police investigation, but said it would be inappropriate to comment until it was complete.

Surf's up: Mark Harris tries out the Eden eco-surfboard. British profession surfer Mark \"Egor\" Harris was one of the first to try the British-made board at Fistral beach in Cornwall, England, giving its performance and eco-credentials the thumbs up. \"It felt good and I can see these boards being popular with surfers. We spend a lot of time on the beach and in the sea and surfers have been campaigning to clean up the oceans for years. This board goes hand-in-hand with that philosophy,\" said Harris. The surfboard has been in development in the south west of England for five years and is the culmination of a collaboration between the Eden Project gardens and biosphere and three local companies. Chris Hines, former sustainability director of the Eden Project and a lifelong surfer and committed environmentalist came up with the idea for the board when a balsa tree had to be taken down in the rainforest biome. \"I said, well, let's make a completely sustainable surfboard, because I knew people who could laminate in hemp cloth and plant-based resin, so we went for it. It was a eureka moment: we thought, let's really have a go, let's really see what we can do,\" he told CNN. Hines and the Eden Project team soon realized that balsa and hemp cloth were too heavy for commercially viable surfboards, but desire remained to produce a surfboard that reduces the reliance on petroleum chemicals and uses more sustainable materials. The Eden team worked with local company Homeblown to create a new type of foam core for the eco-board, 15 to 20 percent of which is made from plant derived material. Another local Cornish company, Sustainable Composites, developed a resin made almost entirely from linseed oil instead of oil-derived coatings, meaning over 50 percent of the final finished surfboards are made from renewable materials.

There is a glimmer of hope for casino workers in Atlantic City, New Jersey, who risk losing their jobs when two - maybe three - of the city's most well-known casinos close their doors later this year - according to the city's mayor, at least one of those casinos has several potential buyers. However, workers at one of those casinos took to the streets Thursday to protest the planned August closing of the Showboat Casino. Chanting 'Keep Showboat open,' hundreds of casino workers and supporters staged a noisy, enthusiastic protest Thursday night on the Atlantic City Boardwalk aimed at getting the owners of the Showboat Casino Hotel to reverse their decision to close it next month. Showboat: Protesters gathered on the Atlantic City boardwalk to protest the planned closing of the Showboat Casino . Trend: Showboat is just one of three casinos that could close in the coming months . Economy: The Atlantic City economy relies almost exclusively on the casino industry, which has taken a serious hit in recent years . More than 400 protesters marched from a small park near the Boardwalk to Caesars Atlantic City, where a small group met with a labor attorney for the parent company that owns both casinos. The attorney promised to meet with union officials Aug. 7, but could not answer their immediate questions, said Donna DeCaprio, secretary-treasurer of Local 54 of the Unite-HERE casino union, which organized the protest. 'We\u2019re going to keep fighting this,' she said. The still-profitable Showboat is one of three Atlantic City casinos that could shut down by September. Trump Plaza plans a Sept. 16 closure, and Revel could also close if a buyer is not found in a bankruptcy auction next month. That could put 8,000 workers on the streets within a few weeks. Atlantic City started the year with 12 casinos, but could end the summer with eight. The Atlantic Club shut down in January. Trump: Dawn French, a cocktail server at Trump Plaza, speaks to protesters during Thursday's protest . 'It\u2019s a tragedy, what\u2019s happening here,' said Curtis Wade, a cook at the Showboat for 27 years. 'We\u2019re a profitable casino; there\u2019s no reason to shut us down.' Speaking to Caesars Entertainment, the casino\u2019s parent company that announced the Showboat closure to reduce competition in the saturated Atlantic City market, Wade said he felt betrayed. 'You said we were like a family, and if we worked hard, we would all prosper,' he said. 'Now you\u2019re turning your back on us. After 27 years, now you say you don\u2019t need me.' Wade and others said they believe other companies are interested in buying the Showboat; Caesars said recently it would consider selling it instead of closing it if a good offer materialized. 'Showboat is a good, viable property,' said Eve Davis, a cocktail server there. 'If Caesars doesn\u2019t want it, fine. Sell it. We just need someone to come in here and love it.' Caesars Entertainment issued a statement saying it has no new information on the status of the Showboat, adding it plans to meet with workers next month to share any updates by then. Iconic: Showboat is one of the most well-known casinos in Atlantic City since it opened in 1987 . Trumped: Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino is scheduled to close later this year as Atlantic City's economy continues to crumble . Buyers: Atlantic City's mayor says there currently are six potential buyers for the troubled Revel hotel and casino . The protesters chanted loudly, blew whistles and beat drums at the entrance of Caesars, where a half-dozen security guards milled about at the front entrance. Many protesters carried hand-made signs excoriating Caesars Entertainment; several included unflattering photos of company CEO Gary Loveman. One read: 'Mr. Loveman: Please let Me Keep My Job.' Others said: 'Atlantic City: Broken Promises.' Bob McDevitt, the union president, said he was pleased at the political and public support for keeping the Showboat open so far.

While Premier League stars park their supercars outside multi-million-pound mansions, Stephanie Houghton earns just \u00a316,000 a year, shares a house with three girls and drives a Vauxhall Corsa. But the new sensation of women\u2019s football is too busy enjoying her sport to be envious of her cosseted male counterparts. \u2018The money doesn\u2019t bother me \u2013 I just want to play football,\u2019 the blonde 24-year-old told the Mail. Although she is a defender, Miss Houghton has scored in all three matches for Great Britain, helping the team to win their group. And today she will try to maintain her goal-a-game record when the team take on Canada in the quarter-finals at Coventry before a sell-out crowd. Miss Houghton became an instant celebrity after scoring the winner against Brazil at Wembley on Tuesday watched by a crowd of 70,000 \u2013 the biggest ever for a women\u2019s football match in England. Such an audience would have been unthinkable a month ago, when many mocked the decision to kick-start the Olympics with women\u2019s football and predicted half-empty stadiums. But Miss Houghton has helped to give the sport a prominence never seen before. Her followers on Twitter have soared from a couple of thousand to 20,556 in just a week and she has been declared the new poster girl for women\u2019s football. The former shop assistant from County Durham is, however, not about to let her success go to her head. \u2018I don\u2019t actually know what\u2019s happening at the moment,\u2019 she said. \u2018I am as surprised as anybody else, to be honest. The last week or so has just been amazing, absolutely unreal. \u2018If somebody had told me before the tournament that I would score three times I would have told them they were having a laugh. It is just what every footballer dreams of.\u2019 Miss Houghton grew up in the former mining village of South Hetton, close to where the dance film Billy Elliot was shot, with posters of Michael Owen and David Beckham on her wall. This week she met Beckham in person. Her mother Amanda, 47, a civil servant, told the Mail: \u2018She sent me a text saying, \u201cHe\u2019s perfect, Mum, he\u2019s absolutely perfect\u201d. \u2018I told her that no man is perfect and she just said, \u201cHe is, Mum. He\u2019s perfect\u201d.\u2019 Although she made Team GB \u2013 unlike Beckham \u2013 Miss Houghton can only dream of a lifestyle like his. Her \u00a316,000 salary comes from England while she receives only expenses from her current club, Arsenal. Where it all began: Houghton's year began in fantastic fashion at the Olympics at Wembley . Celebration time: Steph takes in the Wembley atmosphere after she helped Team GB beat Brazil . Her shared home is close to the club\u2019s training ground in London Colney, Hertfordshire. But if she is disappointed by her lifestyle, she doesn\u2019t show it. She told the Mail: \u2018It\u2019s not comparable to the men\u2019s game and it shouldn\u2019t be: this is a completely different game.\u2019 As a teenager, she watched Bend It Like Beckham \u2018over and over again\u2019, but her story also has more than a passing resemblance to 1981 film Gregory\u2019s Girl, in which a teenage girl plays for a boys\u2019 football team. Growing up: Aged eight, with four-year-old brother Stuart, and right, a star of the future at six months . She was given her first football at the age of three and, when she started primary school, became the only girl on the team. Her father Len, 47, an electrician, recalled how a boy\u2019s parents were furious when their son was left out of the team in favour of her. He said: \u2018They said she was the token girl and she shouldn\u2019t have been picked at all. They said, \u201cWhat\u2019s she playing for, this is a boys\u2019 game?\u201d \u2018Steph went on to score two goals in that match and someone said, \u201cThat\u2019s why she was playing\u201d.\u2019 Number one fans: With grandmother Doreen and brother Stuart last year . At the age of nine, during a summer coaching camp run by Sunderland FC, she was spotted by a talent scout and joined the academy. She made her debut for the women\u2019s team at 14 and moved on to Leeds United before signing for Arsenal in 2010. Her mother joked: \u2018We tried to convert her into a girl but we couldn\u2019t. She never had a doll or a pram. It was always just a football.\u2019 Mr Houghton said: \u2018The world is now her oyster. But she\u2019s very level-headed and her feet are well and truly on the ground. \u2018The Olympics will be over in a week for her and she\u2019ll just head back to Arsenal and carry on as normal.\u2019 Miss Houghton, who is single, said she had been inundated with messages from well-wishers. \u2018The support I\u2019ve had from family and friends has been unreal. My family always travel down and watch me play \u2013 and bring my grandma.\u2019"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Stephanie Houghton, from South Hetton, has become a sensation in women's football, playing for Arsenal and earning \u00a316,000 a year.

Valerie Trierweiler boarded an Air France flight to Mumbai with an entourage that included her friend actress Charlotte Valandrey, BFMTV reported from the French capital's Charles de Gaulle Airport. Valandrey told BFMTV that Trierweiler \"was very happy to leave for that mission to save children in India. ... She is a strong woman with a heart ... someone who can be counted on and who is engaged in a humanitarian cause.\" While in India, her schedule will include attending a charity gala dinner, Action Against Hunger said on its website. It will be her first public appearance since a media storm over Hollande's alleged affair with an actress erupted this month. French president says it's over . Goodbye message . Hollande declared his relationship with Trierweiler over on Saturday. \"I wish to make it known that I have ended my shared life (partnership) with Valerie Trierweiler,\" Hollande told the Agence France-Presse news agency. Hollande's private life has been the subject of global headlines since the French magazine Closer claimed this month he'd been having an affair with actress Julie Gayet for two years. Speculation about the split swirled Saturday after a French national weekly reported Hollande was expected to announce his separation from Trierweiler later in the day. But the French presidency initially denied the report that an announcement would be made. \"It is a rumor that circulated on the Internet today. There is absolutely no confirmation of the publication of a statement today,\" the palace press officer told CNN. Hollande meets with Pope Francis amid scandal . U.S. trip planned for February .

Last weekend, Trierweiler left the hospital where she had spent a week being treated for stress and fatigue, Paris Match reported. The magazine also said she would recover for \"several days\" in an official residence in Versailles. Hollande, 59, has seen his personal approval ratings plummet since his election, although this has been attributed to dissatisfaction with his leadership rather than disapproval of his private life.

David Cameron suffered a humiliating reverse last night when more than half his MPs rejected his 11th-hour appeals for support for same-sex marriage. On an extraordinary day in the Commons, 134 Tory MPs took advantage of a free vote to oppose the plans. Only 126 backed the legislation, with 35 abstaining. But with the help of the majority of Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs Mr Cameron saw the measure passed easily, by a margin of 400 to 175. The first gay marriages are likely to be conducted within 12 months. The standard bearer of the Tory Right, Iain Duncan Smith, voted in favour of same-sex unions, but the Government\u2019s top lawyer, Dominic Grieve, astonished colleagues by abstaining. A source close to Mr Grieve said: \u2018He is a practising member of the Church of England and it has caused a lot of hurt and upset for the church.\u2019 Cabinet ministers who voted against the measure included Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who said privately some years ago in a discussion about gay marriage that \u2018biddies don\u2019t like botties\u2019, and Welsh Secretary David Jones. They were joined by Simon Burns, Esther McVey and John Hayes. Mr Cameron has been accused of needlessly splitting his party and prioritising an issue important to only a handful of voters. One poll suggests 70 per cent of voters now see the Tories as divided. Despite the vote being deemed one of conscience, Tory MPs had been left in no doubt that the party leadership wanted as many as possible to vote in favour. Senior ministers including George Osborne, William Hague and Theresa May were wheeled out on the eve of the debate to make the case. Senior Tories had suggested before the vote it was crucial for Mr Cameron to win over more than half of his party \u2013 a benchmark he failed to meet. However, several Tories who rejected the measure said they objected to being described as \u2018rebels\u2019, since it was a free vote. Labour also suffered a split, with 22 of its MPs voting against. Scroll down for video . Passed: The Commons voted in favour of same-sex weddings by 400 votes to 175, a majority of 225 .

A handful of Liberal Democrats \u2013 including former children\u2019s minister Sarah Teather \u2013 did likewise. The Prime Minister said: \u2018I am a strong believer in marriage. It helps people commit to each other and I think it is right that gay people should be able to get married too. \u2018This is, yes, about equality. But it is also about making our society stronger. I know there are strong views on both side of the argument \u2013 I accept that. But this is an important step forward for our country.\u2019 But Graham Brady, the chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, expressed doubts over the Government\u2019s assurances that faith groups will not be forced to conduct gay marriages.

Margot James, a leading modernising MP, accused the Church of England and anti-gay marriage campaigners of a \u2018deliberate\u2019 attempt to distort the debate by falsely claiming faith groups would be forced to conduct same-sex ceremonies. She warned the Conservatives risked alienating mainstream voters in the same way as US Republicans if they failed to embrace social changes such as equal marriage. The MP for Stourbridge, who is gay, told the Commons: \u2018My party should never flinch from the requirement that we must continue this progression, otherwise we may end up like the Republican party who lost an election last year that they could have won were it not for their socially conservative agenda.\u2019 Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: \u2018We will look back on today as a landmark for equality in Britain.\u2019 Labour leader Ed Miliband said: \u2018This is a proud day and an important step forward in the fight for equality in Britain.\u2019 Colin Hart, of the Coalition for Marriage, which has opposed the legislation, said: \u2018This result is a disaster for David Cameron.

Mr Cameron must think again.\u2019 Last night was not the first time Mr Cameron has gone into the Commons division lobbies with a minority of his MPs over gay rights.

Veteran Dolphins players have been accused of forcing newer recruits to fund their lavish lifestyles including $30,000 dinners and trips to Las Vegas. According to reports on ESPN and in the Miami Herald on Sunday, the alleged bank-rolling is behind Jonathon Martin's shock leave of absence from the team last week. ESPN claims lineman Richie Incognito got Martin to contribute $15,000 to help finance a trip to Vegas last summer, even though he didn't attend. However, Incognito quickly disputed the report on Twitter. Bullying claims: Miami Dolphins Guard Richie Incognito, right, has been accused of bullying younger players though he denies the claims . Meanwhile, the Herald reported that one unnamed young player had coughed up so much cash to veterans that he's gone broke. Reporter Adam Beasley tweeted: 'Recently, a younger player was handed the tab for a $30,000 team dinner. The rookie minimum this year is around $400.000.' Two tweets from Jared Odrick and Will Davis support the accusation. 'Everything tastes better when . rookies pay for it,' Odrick tweeted on November 2, while Davis wrote 'I . just seen a dinner bill for $30,000... WOW #RookieNight' The team came out on Sunday labelling the accusations of bullying 'speculation.' They added that their number one concern was Martin's health and well-being. 'The Miami Dolphins, including Coach Joe Philbin and Jonathan's teammates, have been in communication with Jonathan and his family since his departure from the club and continue to be in contact. Our primary concern for Jonathan is his overall health and well-being,' the statement read. 'As an organization, we take any accusations of player misconduct seriously. The notion of bullying is based on speculation and has not been presented to us as a concern from Jonathan or anyone else internally. The reports that the NFLPA is investigating our players are inaccurate. Additionally, the NFL offered its assistance during this time, which we appreciated and gladly accepted. We will continue to make Jonathan's health and well-being a focus as we do with all of our players.' After ESPN reporters Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefer's latest story, Incognito took to Twitter to rubbish the claims against him, writing '@AdamSchefter Stop slandering my name.

The . latest taunts prompted Martin to leave Dolphins headquarters on Monday . after a group of players stood up and left when he tried joining them . for lunch. The incident caused Martin, 24, to finally reach his limit and walk out, reports FOX Sports. Martin is receiving professional assistance for emotional issues.

Educated: The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University . The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University. He played in last Sunday's loss at New England, then missed practice during the week. He was replaced by Tyson Clabo in Thursday night's game against Cincinnati. A second-round draft pick from Stanford, Martin started every game at right tackle as a rookie last year. He switched to left tackle this season, then moved back to the right side last month in a reshuffling of the Dolphins' struggling offensive line. 'You can approach this two different ways,' Martin said regarding his latest position switch at the time. 'You can go in the tank and be one of those guys that moans and is a cancer in the locker room, or you can be a professional and play as hard as you can. My mindset is I'm going to go out there and do whatever I can to help the team win.' Pass protection has been a problem for Miami all season. Ryan Tannehill went into the Bengals game with an NFL-high 32 sacks, and the Dolphins (3-4) were saddled with a four-game losing streak. Martin's agent didn't respond to requests for comment. The walkout raises questions about Martin's future with the franchise. The NFL Players Association is monitoring the situation and has made inquiries into determining what has happened with Martin, a source told FOX Sports.

The report in a Punjabi newspaper does not mince words. It talks of a \u2018crazed\u2019 Englishwoman arousing concerns for her safety in the Sikh holy city of Anandpur Sahib in India. It claims that in the confines of a Sikh temple, she has been seen bathing in sacred pools \u2018without clothes\u2019 \u2014 which, if true, is an outrageous act in such a conservative, deeply spiritual society \u2014 and keeping her underwear near the holy book, akin to sacrilege. Lately, it states, she has been seen wandering around in the streets, bazaars and temples alone, like a \u2018crazed person\u2019, and has become the talk of the town. Baba Gurdev Singh Ji, chief executor of the Shaheedi Bagh Sikh temple, is quoted asking for the UK High Commission to take her back and hand her over to her family. \u2018If someone misbehaves with this foreign woman,\u2019 he is reported saying, \u2018then India will gain a bad reputation.\u2019 The article \u2014 which claims the woman was left by her husband \u2014 suggests that some locals are worried she could be a British government spy, so bizarre is her behaviour. So who is this woman, the source of such worrying gossip? None other than former socialite Alexandra Aitken, daughter of disgraced former Tory minister Jonathan Aitken and Sikh convert who now goes by the name of Uttrang Kaur Khalsa. The unsubstantiated report, published in November, couldn\u2019t be in starker contrast to the glossy 2010 Hello! magazine spread celebrating the marriage of the former \u2018It-girl\u2019, now 34, and Inderjot Singh, a Sikh \u2018warrior\u2019 from the Punjab. It was an unlikely union from the start \u2014 Alexandra\u2019s life once centred on Mayfair parties, posh boys and polo \u2014 and rumours it was in trouble have been rife for months. Last weekend, Alexandra\u2019s father finally confirmed it was over and that the couple, who met at a yoga retreat in the Punjabi holy city of Amritsar, were now \u2018detached\u2019 \u2014 if, indeed, they were ever legally married. Although they affirmed their commitment to each other in a ceremony in Amritsar attended by 150 holy men and 300 guests, there is doubt that the marriage was ever officially registered. According to a report in the Tribune newspaper last September, the union came under strain when Alexandra did not appear before a magistrate to register the marriage and didn\u2019t attend the funeral of Inderjot\u2019s father. This week, approached by the Mail as she attended a Sikh festival, Alexandra politely declined to comment on her marriage or the report of naked bathing in holy pools (Sikh women usually go in fully clothed). \u2018I am really happy that you approached to speak with me, but I do not wish to speak to anyone. Have a nice day,\u2019 she said, before disappearing into the crowd. While the marriage may be over, Alexandra\u2019s passion for her adopted religion remains undimmed. It is thought to be why she remains in Anandpur Sahib, even if her presence appears to cause consternation to other residents of the sleepy \u2018Holy City of Bliss\u2019. Here, she is one of the few, if not the only, unattached Western woman in the 16,000 population \u2014 such a rarity that police apparently turned up at her lodgings recently to ask why she was there and check all was well. According to a police officer, she was asked to fill out a foreigner\u2019s registration form \u2014 to ensure the safety of foreign nationals \u2014 on which she listed her status as \u2018unmarried\u2019 and named her father as an emergency contact. She then asked to be left alone. Home for the privately educated art school graduate for the past few months has been a \u00a312-a-night room in a guest house, with nothing more than a bed, toilet and TV. Transformation: Alexandra at a London film premiere in 2003 (left) and with Inderjot after their 'marriage' Described by staff as \u2018kind-hearted\u2019, she is so environmentally conscious that she asks them \u2018not to waste water and electricity\u2019. \u2018Madam doesn\u2019t talk much,\u2019 said one. \u2018She keeps to herself most of the time, but she would get really angry if someone left the lights on during the day. She would make sure the taps in her room never dripped water.\u2019 According to locals, Alexandra first stayed in Anandpur Sahib last year with her husband, a member of a Sikh order called the Nihang. When she returned six months ago, however, she was alone. For a month she stayed in a dera, or Sikh seminary, before moving into lodgings. Inderdeep Singh, a caretaker at the Keshgarh Sikh temple attended by Alexandra, told us: \u2018I was told that her husband was a Nihang and that they had a break-up. \u2018So when she came here, I could see she was heartbroken. In this house of God, she found peace. Since then she comes to prayers at the gurdwara (temple) regularly.\u2019 Jonathan Aitken, 72, told the Mail: \u2018My daughter is still a very devoted Sikh and I am personally still on good terms with Inderjot. Miss Aitken's father told the Mail she remains a devoted Sikh despite separating from her Indian 'husband' \u2018They remain friends, but the marriage is not working in any sense that we would understand, and there is considerable doubt whether it was a lawful marriage ceremony \u2014 or so I am told.\u2019 Dismissing reports of her \u2018crazed\u2019 behaviour as \u2018nonsense\u2019, he said: \u2018She likes to maintain her privacy. She doesn\u2019t have a mobile and it\u2019s hard to get hold of her. She tries to stay clear of the world. \u2018I\u2019m absolutely confident that she is safe and knows what she is doing. She has lodgings which my ex-wife and I pay the rent for. \u2018She was here in Britain until October and has been visited by several people since who have all said that she is safe and happy.\u2019 H e later confirmed: \u2018They were not married and are now detached. It was more a colourful, folklore ceremony than a proper one. I think both sides know the marriage is over, if it ever was a marriage.\u2019 Certainly Alexandra\u2019s faith appears to be deeply held. Last month, she posted a new profile picture on Facebook showing herself wearing a Sikh turban. Completely divorced from her old life of London parties \u2014 dwarves dressed in Dennis the Menace outfits once served up toffee vodkas for guests at her 22nd birthday bash \u2014 Alexandra is devoted to spreading Sikh principles and extols the Punjabi way of living on two websites. The former actress, who once posed naked for GQ magazine, now writes about the benefits of wearing a chunni (long scarf) made of cotton rather than silk because it is \u2018cooling and calming for the mind\u2019. Mr Aitken added he remained on good terms with his daughter's former partner . Devoted to charitable work and helping the poor, she has a vision of building schools, hospitals and meditation centres. In 2013, her father revealed that when she returned to Britain to visit she refused to sleep in a bedroom, instead camping in the garden of her aunt, actress Maria Aitken, so she could lie on the earth. \u2018It\u2019s all part of being close to the soil,\u2019 said Mr Aitken. \u2018I find it very hard to get my head around all this, but I love her dearly.\u2019 Formerly effusive about her \u2018noble\u2019 husband and their shared spirituality, Alexandra has kept quiet since their \u2018rough patch\u2019 became public knowledge. \u2018Many believe, don\u2019t talk unless it improves on silence,\u2019 is all she would say. Asked about her marriage at a Sikh conference in London in 2013, she became defensive and finally replied: \u2018God is my true love.\u2019 Perhaps the only clue to what went wrong can be found in a cryptic message posted on the Nihangi website for which she occasionally writes. Under the heading \u2018A Biography \u2014 Uttrang Kaur Khalsa\u2019 are the simple words: A Lover. The Wife. The Student. The Hopeful Listener. Forgive me. Sat Siri Akal (God is the Ultimate Truth). A family friend said that Alexandra had been wrestling with the fact that, apart from their faith, she and Inderjot had very little in common: she saw herself as a free spirit, in touch with Nature, while he was more traditional and felt that her place was at home with him. \u2018There\u2019s a feeling among her friends and family that she rushed into marriage,\u2019 says the friend. Alexandra and Inderjot met in 2009 and it was her love of Kundalini yoga, which is associated with Sikhism, that first drew her to the religion. By then her privileged upbringing had been shattered after her father was jailed for 18 months in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice. She had also discovered that her friend Petrina Khashoggi was, in fact, her half-sister \u2014 the result of an affair between Jonathan and Soraya Khashoggi. \u2018She couldn\u2019t be more different from the girl who used to walk down Sloane Street,\u2019 said one old friend. \u2018She looks unkempt, she doesn\u2019t cut her hair and when she was here she was telling everyone what they should and shouldn\u2019t eat.\u2019 Yet, despite the end of her short-lived marriage, is she happy? Her father certainly believes so. And so does Alexandra."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Alexandra Aitken, a Sikh convert and daughter of ex-Tory minister Jonathan Aitken, has been seen behaving unusually in Anandpur Sahib, India, causing local concern.

Italy's new government vowed to make protecting women from violence a priority on the same day as the funeral of a 16-year-old girl allegedly killed by her boyfriend took place. MPs in the country's chamber of deputies unanimously voted to pass the Council of Europe's convention on violence against women as Fabiana Luzzi, whose death caused national outrage, was mourned by residents of Corigliano Calbro in southern Italy. The teenager was allegedly stabbed to death by her 17-year-old boyfriend last week then doused in petrol and set alight while she is thought to have still been alive. Victim: Fabiana Luzzi was allegedly stabbed to death by her boyfriend in Italy last week. Her death added urgency to a parliamentary vote which saw Italian MPs prioritise action against gender-based violence .

'I feel the need to ask forgiveness from her and all the women killed by the hand of those who abuse the word love.

Women's campaign group Casa della Donne claims that at least 51 women have been murdered in Italy so far this year, but with no official statistics, they believe the figure could actually be three times that. The group praised the Italian government for ratifying the convention - known as the Istanbul Convention - but added that it must ensure that its measures are thoroughly followed through. According to statistics from Istat published in 2011, around one in three Italian women are victims of domestic violence.

We want to play football.\" Without a last-minute agreement or the extension of the deadline, the NFL Players Association had been expected to decertify on Thursday afternoon -- meaning it would stop being the collective bargaining agent for the players. By decertifying, the union would clear the way for the players to file an antitrust lawsuit if the owners lock out the players as soon as Friday, after the current contract expires. All of that would mean the first NFL work stoppage since 1987 and the likelihood of months of labor and legal maneuvering for football fans already confused about how a $9 billion industry lacks enough money to satisfy everyone. Even if there is a lockout, the NFL draft would proceed as scheduled on April 28-30, the league says. All other regular off-season activity would cease, threatening to delay or cancel the start of the 2011 season now scheduled for September 8. Asked about the talks, President Obama said Thursday that the parties ought to be able to figure out how to split the revenue and keep fans happy. \"You've got owners, most of whom are worth close to a billion dollars, you've got players who are making millions of dollars,\" he said during a joint news conference with visiting Mexican President Felipe Calderon. \"My working assumption, at a time when people are having to cut back, compromise and worry about making the mortgage and paying for their kids' college education is that the two parties should be able to work it out without the president of the United States intervening.\" Currently, the owners take about $1 billion off the top of league revenue, and the players get 60 percent of the rest. For a new contract, the owners want to double their take off the top to $2 billion, with the players continuing to get 60 percent of the rest. The NFL generated $9.3 billion in revenue in 2010. Other issues include a proposal by the owners to increase the regular season schedule to 18 games from the current 16. The overall number of games per season, including exhibition games, would remain at the current 20. The players' union questions why the owners should get additional money up front and challenges the league's 32 teams to fully open their financial records. The owners, who say they are not legally obligated to provide full financial disclosure, argue they are looking out for the long-term stability of the franchises and the league. If there is a lockout, players won't get their salaries or bonuses, and if the shutdown forces the league to cancel games next season, the NFL estimates a loss of $400 million in revenue each week. Another possible scenario from the talks would have Cohen declare an impasse that would automatically extend the rules of the expiring collective bargaining agreement. Such an impasse can only occur if neither side takes steps to halt the negotiations, such as the union decertifying or the owners declaring a lockout."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The NFL and players union extended their collective bargaining agreement negotiations.

It look\u00a0remarkably like the Starfleet insignia in Star Trek . One possible is that it was a bit of debris that hit the lens, or even the moon. But 'Streetcap1', the YouTuber who posted the video isn't convinced. 'Please bear in mind that the moon appears white when it shows,' he writes. Meanwhile on October 7, UFO watchers said they witnessed a strange object near the station during a spacewalk by astronauts Reid Wiserman and Alexander Gerst. The object was later identified as being either a speck of dust or a lens flare from the sun. That didn't stopped some conspiracy theories arising though, with ufologists somewhat speculatively claiming it was proof that we are not alone in the universe. One of the most interesting cases in the files is the Lubbock Lights incident was reported August 30, 1951 in Texas . In 1948, the US government launched several inquiries into UFO sightings, which many believed were sparked by Cold War paranoia. In what became known as 'Project Blue Book,' more than 12,000 encounters with UFOs were looked into by the Air Force. Now, decades after the files were closed, the microfilms have been made available online for free \u2013 allowing anyone to re-examine the evidence. The USAF says that the Blue Book included 12,618 sightings reports, with 701 of which remained 'unidentified' \u2013 or around 5.5 per cent of the files. The files, which can be accessed here, were previously only available by visiting the National Archives in Washington. Professor Andrew Balogh from the Imperial College London Department of Physics tells MailOnline: 'Generally speaking UFO sightings are either explained by some artefact effect - even some space junk - or left unexplained as there is not enough evidence. 'It's difficult to judge from the video in this instance, because of its poor quality. If Nasa has access to high quality images, they may investigate further.' Nasa is yet to comment the incidents. The space agency's ISS live stream and rover photos have become a huge source of 'evidence' for conspiracy theorists. Many scientists believe UFO sightings such as this are down to a psychological phenomenon called pareidolia. This describes the brain's response to seeing significant objects in random places. 'The vast majority of these images are as vague and elusive as those posted by UFO witnesses on Earth, and many have a fairly mundane explanation, 'Nigel Watson author of the UFO investigations Manual told MailOnline. 'The problem is that the more Nasa denies such things or explains them the more people\u00a0think there is a conspiracy to hide the truth that aliens are visiting our planet.'

The couple proceeded into the house and continued to shoot her older brother. When she turned her gun to her father it was too late. He had retrieved a .22-caliber pistol after hearing the commotion and shot her in the head. When her husband tried to retaliate, he shot him as well. By the time police arrived, Mrs Frew, John Frew Jr and Jeff Ruckinger were already dead. Josephine was still alive with a gunshot wound to the head, but died later at the hospital. It was only when Mr Frew was being questioned by police that he was informed that it was his daughter Josephine that he killed. He hadn't recognized her. The two had been estranged for years, and a family member says Josephine nursed a grudge for her family. Josephine had 'a hatred toward the family' according to her aunt Virginia Cruse, who spoke with the Lewistown Sentinel. Cruse said the daughter and mother did not get along, but that she had no idea what spawned Friday's tragedy. When Josephine was about 20, she and a boyfriend trashed her parents' home and stole items including a pistol, then fled to Pittsburgh, Cruse said. After that, she said, 'more or less, they disowned her. Jeff Ruckinger worked for a tire repair company and Josephine had disabilities that prevented her from working, Cruse said."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "John Frew killed his estranged daughter, Josephine, and her husband, Jeff Ruckinger, a tire repair worker, after they invaded his home with a sawed-off shotgun, murdering his wife, Roberta, and son, John Jr. Josephine, who had disabilities, died in the hospital.

Belonging to a tiny shrimp, the sperm, when uncoiled, was longer than the crustacean's entire body. The preserved semen were discovered at the Riversleigh World Heritage Fossil Site in Queensland, Australia, and are the oldest ever found. World's oldest: The world's oldest fossilised sperm has been discovered coiled up inside a tint shrimp. This image is a cross-section of 17 million year old fossil ostracod sperm. The nuclei in each sperm (dark spot) are indicated by arrows . The giant sperm are thought to have been longer than the length of the creature\u2019s body but are tightly coiled up inside the sexual organs of the fossilised freshwater crustaceans, which are known as ostracods. \u2018These are the oldest fossilised sperm ever found in the geological record,\u2019 said Professor Mike Archer, of the University of New South Wales\u2019 School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences. He has been excavating at Riversleigh for more than 35 years. \u2018The Riversleigh fossil deposits in remote north-western Queensland have been the site of the discovery of many extraordinary prehistoric Australian animals, such as giant, toothed platypuses and flesh-eating kangaroos. So we have become used to delightfully unexpected surprises in what turns up there. An artist's impression of the site 17 million years ago. The cave was in the middle of a rainforest in an area that is now part of the Riversleigh World Heritage Fossil Site in Queensland, Australia. Tiny ostracods lived in a pool of water in the cave that was continually enriched by the droppings of thousands of bats . \u2018But the discovery of fossil sperm, complete with sperm nuclei, was totally unexpected. It now makes us wonder what other types of extraordinary preservation await discovery in these deposits.\u2019 A research team from the university collected the fossil ostracods from the Bitesantennary Site at Riversleigh in 1988. They were sent to John Neil, a specialist ostracod researcher at La Trobe University in Melbourne who realised they contained fossilised soft tissues. Experts including Dr Renate Matzke-Karasz from Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, who authored the study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, examined the specimens at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. The microscopic study revealed the fossils contain the preserved internal organs of the ostracods, including their sexual organs. This is a sketch of a male ostracod, showing the organisation and orientation of the reproductive system . The creature's zenker organs - muscular pumps used to transfer the giant sperm to the female - were preserved. 'C' shows a scanning electron microscopic image of Riversleigh fossil ostracod on its left side, 'd' shows one of the creature's zenker organs and 'e' shows details of the zenker organ, including its chitinous rings marked as (cr) The microscopic study revealed that the fossils contain the preserved internal organs of the ostracods, including their sexual organs. Within these are the almost perfectly preserved giant sperm cells and within them, the nuclei that once contained the animals' chromosomes and DNA. The creature\u2019s zenker organs \u2013 muscular pumps used to transfer the giant sperm to the female \u2013 were also preserved. The researchers estimate that the fossilised sperm are about 1.3 millimetres long, which is about the same length or slightly longer than the ostracod itself. \u2018About 17 million years ago, Bitesantennary Site was a cave in the middle of a vast biologically diverse rainforest. Tiny ostracods thrived in a pool of water in the cave that was continually enriched by the droppings of thousands of bats,\u2019 Professor Archer explained. 'About 17 million years ago, Bitesantennary Site was a cave in the middle of a vast biologically diverse rainforest. Tiny ostracods thrived in a pool of water in the cave that was continually enriched by the droppings of thousands of bats,' Professor Archer explained. The site of the fossil cave is pictured . Professor Suzanne Hand, a specialist in extinct bats and their ecological role in Riversleigh's ancient environments at the university, believes that the bats could have played a role in the preservation of the ostracod sperm cells. The steady rain of faeces from thousands of bats in the cave would have led to high levels of phosphorous in the water, which could have aided mineralisation of the soft tissues. \u2018This amazing discovery at Riversleigh is echoed by a few examples of soft-tissue preservation in fossil bat-rich deposits in France. So the key to eternal preservation of soft tissues may indeed be some magic ingredient in bat droppings,\u2019 Professor Hand said. Riversleigh has previously revealed insects with internal muscles that have been preserved because bacteria became fossilised as they attempted to consume the soft tissues of the creatures. Perfectly preserved cells of leaves have been found, as well as the preserved soft tissue of eyeballs in the eye sockets of some of the extinct marsupials.

A Michigan mother of two young boys who said she was battling cancer just a few years after a man was convicted of her rape, has been exposed as a total fraud. Sara Ylen, 38, has been charged with fraud, false pretenses and . using a computer to commit a crime after state police found no doctor . who diagnosed the cancer. The charges come as a local man, James Grissom, who spent nearly 10 years in . prison for her rape was released last year, after newly discovered . evidence cast doubt on whether she'd ever been attacked. Fraudster: Sara Ylen (left), 38 has been charged with fraud after appealing for money to fight her cancer after she also claimed she was raped, for which James Grissom (right) served almost 10 years in prison for . Ylen's community, which had come to . admire her as the subject of a newspaper's award-winning 2003 series . about surviving a rape, rallied when her cancer diagnosis became public. Churches sold Super Bowl sub sandwiches and auction items to raise . money. Friends cut her grass, bathed her at her modest home and provided . hot meals. An insurance company paid nearly $100,000 for hospice care. One of her close friends, Carol Connell, spoke of the gift she gave Ylen, in a bid to help give her hope in her time of need. 'It was a little box, a very ornate box, to hold a prayer. She needed God to look over her,' Connell said, recalling the 2008 lunch when she gave Ylen the jewelry. 'Sara was visibly touched.' Connell now can't help but wonder whether Ylen was showing gratitude or simply perpetuating years of jaw-dropping deceit. 'The fact that she's lived this long is a miracle. But maybe it wasn't a miracle after all. ... I'm just baffled. Is she the biggest con artist in the state of Michigan or the victim?' Connell said. The fraud case isn't Ylen's only concern. In a neighboring county, she is charged with making a false report of rape just last year, even using makeup to create bruises. Ylen (pronounced WHY'-len) and her attorney, Dave Heyboer, have not returned phone messages seeking comment. Elaborate stories: In 2002, Ylen told police she had been raped in broad daylight in a store parking lot more than a year earlier - there was no evidence but a man was convicted . The Associated Press went to a Lexington address listed in court documents, but she no longer lives there. The two cases against Ylen come years after she first emerged in the public eye in the Port Huron area, 60 miles northeast of Detroit. In 2002, Ylen told police she had been raped in broad daylight in a Meijer store parking lot more than a year earlier. There was no surveillance video, physical evidence or witnesses. James Grissom, an off-duty Meijer employee with a past sex-related conviction, was charged after Ylen said her attacker, like Grissom, had a skull tattoo. He was found guilty in 2003 and sentenced to at least 15 years in prison, an enhanced punishment because Ylen said her attacker gave her a sexually transmitted disease. Next, Ylen told her story to the Port Huron Times Herald. She said she wanted people to see her as a 'victor', not a 'victim'. Readers inspired by 'Sara's Story', as the series was titled, started a fund to send her to community college. But it didn't take long for Ylen's story to start unraveling. Authorities learned she claimed to have been kidnapped and raped while visiting her parents in Bakersfield, California, just months after the alleged parking lot attack back in Michigan. No charges were filed. 'My daughter likes to have a lot of attention,' her father, Dale Hill, told Bakersfield officers in a 2001 police report that wasn't uncovered until after Grissom's trial. Hill told the AP this week that he hasn't spoken to his daughter in years and didn't know anything about her recent claims. After years of appeals, a judge in 2012 ruled that the police report could have changed the outcome of Grissom's trial and ordered a new one, saying Ylen appeared to have 'concocted incredible stories' in California. Prosecutors dropped the case without a second trial, and Grissom was freed in November. As Grissom's appeals were moving through the courts, Ylen was telling people she had developed cancer from a disease transmitted during the assault. She was back in the newspaper, supported by friends, including a state police sergeant, who believed she was on the verge of death in 2009. 'Job of the Old Testament had nothing on Sara Ylen,' wrote Times Herald columnist Mike Connell, who is married to Carol Connell, referring to a pious man who repeatedly suffered misfortune. Just about a year ago, Ylen was in a wheelchair at a Croswell Wesleyan Church auction and spaghetti dinner that raised $10,800. 'I thought I was doing something good for someone who had cancer. It's like a bad Lifetime movie,' said event organizer Sue Birtles. 'I've heard that some people want their money back. ... I'm working on forgiveness.' Mercy Hospice, which visited Ylen at her home, declined to comment on her care but said in a statement that any terminal illness typically 'must be certified' by a patient's doctor before services are provided. Ylen's ex-husband, Jim, declined to comment on the criminal charges against his former wife, but divorce records indicate he had long doubted her tales of woe. The couple were married in 1993, separated in 2007 and divorced in 2011. The marriage 'broke down due to the wife's complex lies and deceit involving fictitious rapes, kidnappings, pregnancies and illnesses \u2013 all attempts to control others by complaining of physical symptoms,' Jim Ylen's attorney, Aaron Cassell, said in a court filing. Sara Ylen told her husband the name of her cancer doctor, but he later learned there was no physician by that name in Michigan, Cassell said. And she wouldn't let him join her at medical appointments, even after driving hundreds of miles to Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Zion, Ill. The clinic says Sara Ylen never was a patient there, according to records reviewed by the AP. Psychologist Daniel Kachman evaluated Ylen as part of the divorce case and told the judge: 'Often feeling dependent and dejected and fearful of rebuff, she may either withdraw from painful social relationships or decide to adapt the role of martyr.' Mike Connell, the newspaper columnist, said he regrets not treating his own doubts more seriously. 'Sara is innocent until proven guilty, but if she did pull off an elaborate con, consider what genius it required,' he said in an email. 'She has a brilliant mind. I recognized that straightaway.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sara Ylen, charged with fraud and making false rape reports, had deceived her community and her ex-husband, leading to their divorce.

Festival fever is well and truly upon us, and although I missed out on Glastonbury as I'm filming in the Big Apple, I'll definitely be digging out the Hunters on my return as there are some awesome smaller UK events coming up I simply can't miss. Last year top celebrity makeup artist Daniel Sandler created a gorgeous boho-style floral festival look for me, which you can check out here. This year I've enlisted Daniel's help once more, but this time we've gone for something altogether different \u2013 a Gwen Stefani-esque party look that blends Nineties grunge-glam and futuristic cool. Here's how we did it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky was inspired by Gwen Stefani for this year's festival look . GET THE LOOK . Step 1 - Ace of Base . At a festival, you need make-up that will make your skin look fresh and radiant as well as last all day. Daniel recommended the Clarins BB Cream \u2013 the coverage is enough to conceal any pesky blemishes while still allowing your skin to breathe. It's easy to apply too \u2013 simply blend into the face with your fingertips, making sure to take the product down the neck to avoid tidemarks. Step 2 - Paint It Black . A black kohl pencil (waterproof, of course!) is a foolproof festival essential \u2013 whatever the look you're going for. So next, Daniel lined my eyes generously with his Daniel Sandler Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet. 'Festival make-up needs to have a little bit of edge,' he explained, 'so to give the eyes a bit more attitude I smudged the liner out slightly with my Lip Brush for a slept-in effect that screams rock'n'roll.' Binky enlisted the help of make-up artist, Daniel Sandler for her bold and bright beauty look . Step 3 - Glitter Bug . Daniel then loaded some of the Too Faced Glamour Dust Glitter Pigment in Pink Fire onto a smudger brush and gently dabbed it over my eyelids. The contrast of the shimmering lilac hue and the black eyeliner provides the perfect blend of girly and edgy. He also applied some to the tops of my cheekbones for a super-cool holographic effect and across my lips to create the illusion of a fuller pout. The mantra 'less is more' certainly doesn't apply to festival make-up \u2013 so feel free to go as wild as you like. A little does go a long way with this pigment, though! Step 4 - Fuschia Flutter . Instead of using a boring black mascara, Daniel decided to mix things up a bit and go for a vivid fuschia shade - in the form of Dior's Addict-It Lash Mascara \u2013 to really make the lashes pop. Daniel says that festival make-up has to have a bit more edge and attitude than a day-to-day look . A statement look like this calls for suitably bold brows, so Daniel defined and darkened mine using his Brown Velvet waterproof eye pencil, sweeping the colour through my brows with a small brush for added volume. Step 5 - After Glow . To give my skin a rosy-radiant glow, Daniel swept his Daniel Sandler Radiant Sheen Illuminating Face Powder across the apples of my cheeks. This pretty palette offers the perfect blend of golden and peachy tones to instantly perk up even the most hungover of complexions - plus the dark shade doubles up as a great contour colour. Finally, Daniel painted my pout with Guerlain Rouge G Lipstick in Gemma \u2013 a bold lilac shade providing a matte but moisturising wash of colour. Binky opted for a bright fuchsia shade of mascara to make her eyes really pop . So there you have it; a rave-ready festival look that will certainly make sure you stand out from the crowd - thanks Daniel! I also thought I'd share with you my top five festival essentials in case any of you are off to a festival soon and are a bit stuck on what to pack in the beauty department.

They risked their lives countless times on what Winston Churchill called 'the worst journey in the world'. Yet the thousands of veterans who sailed on Arctic convoys to support the Russian war effort have been told they cannot collect bravery medals. Some 3,000 servicemen have been offered Ushakov medals by the Russian government to recognise their courage in taking part in Arctic missions to support fighting on the eastern front during the Second World War. Harrowing conditions: Thousands of sailors risked their lives in Arctic conditions to support the Russian war effort during the Second World war . Appalling cold: Snow and ice covered the upper works of all ships. Some 3,000 servicemen were awarded bravery medals for taking part in the daring campaign . But they have been told by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) that accepting the medals would break rules in this country. Among those who were involved in the daring campaign was Lieutenant Commander Roy Francis, 90, from Forncett St Mary, Norfolk, who served on the cruiser HMS Edinburgh when it travelled to Murmansk in 1942 as the flagship for the convoys. On the return journey the cruiser, carrying four tonnes of gold bullion as payment from Stalin, was attacked over successive days by waves of enemy aircraft, submarines and destroyers. The ship was hit by two torpedoes and, despite fighting on for three days, was eventually sunk by a third. Crippled: HMS Edinburgh was sunk carrying four tonnes of gold bullion.

The ship (stern pictured) fought on for three days after it was hit by two torpedoes before it was eventually sunk by a third . Two officers and 56 seamen died as the rest were evacuated to other ships. Lt Cdr Francis said: \u2018Arctic convoys were renowned to be the toughest voyages. In addition to the threats from U-boats, bombers and surface craft to all convoys, the main enemy was the bitter cold. \u2018I've known of ships where the build-up of ice led to the whole thing capsizing and the ship disappearing with all hands. Pictured is the Russian Medal of Ushakov, awarded for bravery . \u2018We had to keep chipping away at the ice, were constantly wet and it was normally too cold to sleep when off watch.\u2019 The FCO told veterans that because they have already been honoured with the Atlantic Star campaign medal, they could not accept the Russian offer. They were also told that their service had to have taken place in the last five years for them to be eligible. It has recently announced the creation of a specific Arctic campaign medal to recognise the severe hardships of this part of naval history. Lt Cdr Francis said: \u2018I'm pleased to see that this government has finally agreed to give us a British campaign medal. \u2018I'm told that checking eligibility for the award may take months, though, so I'm hoping I'll still be around when all of the bureaucracy has been carried out. None of us are getting any younger. \u2018I think they have got it wrong, though. The Russian government wants to give us a bravery medal, not a campaign medal. There is a big difference. \u2018Why can't our Government bend the rules when the Australian, Canadian, New Zealand and American governments have all allowed their veterans to accept this great honour? \u2018I think the Government should do what is right by the thousands of us who endured for freedom all those years ago, many of whom never made it.\u2019 A spokesman for the FCO said the department appreciated the Russian government's wish to recognise the \u2018brave and valuable\u2019 service given by veterans of the Arctic convoys. He said: \u2018The rules on the acceptance of foreign awards clearly state that in order for permission to be given for an award to be accepted, there has to have been specific service to the country concerned and that that service should have taken place within the previous five years.

But experts say it is not working . Germany is battling a baby drought that has caused its population to plummet, leaving a rash of vacant homes, dry sewers and fears the economy may crumble, experts have warned. In its most recent census, Germany discovered it had lost 1.5 million inhabitants and, by 2060, experts say the population could dwindle by an extra 19 per cent, to about 66 million. Between 2000 and 2013, Germany's . birth rate dropped by 11 per cent compared to rises in the UK (4.3 per . cent), France (3.6 per cent), Spain (12.8 per cent) and Ireland (8.9 per cent). Now panic is beginning to spread through Europe's economic powerhouse as the financial crisis continues to stretch its tentacles into all aspects of society, especially the country's labour market. Adding to the country's woes, a recent study by Europe's Population Policy Acceptance Study found that 23 per cent of German men thought 'zero' was the ideal family size. 'In some areas, there are now abundant overgrown yards, boarded-up . windows and concerns about sewage systems too empty to work properly,' reports the New York Times. 'The work force is rapidly graying, and assembly lines are being . redesigned to minimize bending and lifting.' Policy makers are now throwing money at families in a bid to stem the birth dearth and encourage citizens to have more babies. But despite spending $265 billion a year on family subsidies, experts say the government is not doing enough claiming Germany needs an overhaul of values, customs and attitudes. According to the New York Times Germany has for many decades had a fraught relationship with immigration. To make matters worse, attitudes to working mothers remains unsympathetic in Germany where women who juggle jobs with children are commonly referred to pejoratively as 'raven mothers', implying neglectfulness. Experts are now claiming Germany needs to find ways of keeping older workers in jobs for longer and make itself more appealing to immigrants, who, they say, tend to find other European nations far more hospitable destinations. It also needs to feed more women into the workforce while, at the same time, encourage them to have more babies. 'If you look closely at the numbers, what you see is the higher the gender equality, the higher the birthrate,' Reiner Klingholz of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development told the New York Times. Keep working: Experts are now claiming Germany needs to find ways of keeping older workers in jobs for longer as fears grow for the country's workforce . But, he added, Germany has long subsidised families of a traditional set up, making change all the more difficult. 'Touching those is political suicide,' Michaela Kreyenfeld of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research told the paper. 'Women are perfectly integrated within Germany's labor market but when it comes to babies, everyone expects a mother to stay at home and take care of the children,' she told reuters last year. 'This of course deters women from becoming mothers.' Last year it emerged the number of births in Germany fell to a post-war low despite a raft of government incentives meant to reverse a population decline. 'Raven mother': Attitudes to working mothers remains unsympathetic in Germany where women who juggle jobs with children are commonly referred to pejoratively as 'raven mothers', implying neglectfulness . A third of all babies born in Germany, still the EU's most populous member state, came from immigrant families, the analysts said, noting that without them the overall figure would have been much lower. The preliminary data released by Germany's Federal Statistics Office showed 663,000 children were born in 2011, down from 678,000 in 2010. How Germany's birth rate compares to Europe (between 2000 and 2013): . 'As in every year since 1972, the number of people who died was greater than the number of children born. In 2011 the difference amounted to 190,000 people and in 2010 to 181,000,' the office said in a report. Demography experts have forecast that Germany's population could shrink to about 50 million by 2050, based on current trends, and say France and Britain - which now have about 60 million each - could overtake it later this century. Germany's birthrate peaked in 1964 when a total of 1,357,304 children were born in the capitalist West and communist East. West Germans were already having fewer children in the 1970s because of improving conditions for women and their easier access to education, said Reiner Klingholz, director of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development. 'So fewer children were born then, meaning that today we lack potential parents for potential children,\" he said.Without immigrant families, the number of newly born children in Germany would reach only 400,000 in a country of 82 million, Klingholz said. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has no children herself, introduced relatively generous child benefit payments in 2006, making it easier for women to return to the workplace after having children.In June 2012, however, in a move critics say entrenches a more traditionalist view of women's roles, Merkel's coalition also approved a bill on childcare payments that would give parents an allowance to keep their toddlers at home rather than sending them to nursery."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Germany's population decline is due to a 11% drop in birth rate and negative attitudes towards working mothers.

Qantas' record $2.84 billion loss didn't come as a shock for a former flight attendant who worked 12 years for the company. Once known as the high-flying luxury airline, Mr Beddall says the iconic Australian brand fails to meet its high standards. Mr Beddall, who spent his career attending to the needs and whims of the rich and famous as a first class Qantas flight attendant, told Daily Mail Australia why The Flying Kangaroo is spiralling downhill and will continue to do so until the Australian government addresses 'the white elephant in the room'. Scroll down for video . Owen Beddall, a former flight attendant, wasn't surprised when Qantas announced its $2.84 billion loss . Mr Beddall met Russell Brand (left) and Katy Perry (right) during his time as a first-class flight attendant for Qantas . The little luxuries are missing . Mr Beddall says Qantas used to pride itself in being a luxury brand with 'the whole package'. 'When I started, we gave our amenity packs which had ear plugs, pajamas, face mist sprays, face masks, expensive moisturisers,' he said. 'The economy class got a little kit too and there was even something for the children.' Mr Beddall, who maintains contact with his former colleagues who currently work for the airline, says passengers have to specifically ask for such services which puts them in 'an awkward position'. This is one of the reasons why he believes passengers are no longer getting their value for money. 'Qantas has taken away the little intricacies and although that may not be the stand alone reason why people don't fly with them anymore, people are paying top dollar and they're not satisfied,' he said. Qantas services and staff are failing to meet the expectations of passengers . Staff morale is at an all-time low . Mr Beddall says his colleagues used to be proud of working for such a landmark Australian brand. 'They would put on their uniform with pride - just as if it was like a military uniform,' he said. 'But now they're embarrassed, fearful for their jobs and disheartened with the union.' He says there's an overall dark element surrounding staff and it's affecting passengers and their flight experience. Mr Beddell says management and the board - including Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce (pictured) - should be held responsible . Board and management are terrible \u2026 and refuse to take responsibility . And it all comes down to the board and management. Mr Beddell says both should be changed immediately with intervention from the government. 'We need to address the white elephant in the room,' he said.

Mourinho had not spoken to the media since Diego Costa was banned for stamping on Emre Can during Chelsea\u2019s ill-tempered Capital One Cup semi-final with Liverpool and Mourinho was fined by the FA for suggesting Chelsea were the victims of a \u2018campaign\u2019 by referees.

Jose Mourinho spoke to press on Friday ahead of Chelsea's trip to Aston Villa . Chelsea manager Mourinho was in a cantankerous mood as he broke his self-imposed silence . Manchester City have had their 2014-15 Champions League squad cut from 25 players to 21 after breaching financial Fair Play rules . 'I don\u2019t think a team can be champions when you are punished, and it\u2019s happened before, because you didn\u2019t comply with FFP.\u2019 City signed \u00a328million Wilfried Bony in the January transfer window while Chelsea came out of the window \u00a37m better off through sales, despite bringing in Juan Cuadrado for \u00a327m. \u2018It\u2019s something that was explained before I joined,\u2019 said Mourinho. \u2018It was explained the profile of the club Mr Abramovich wants, with total respect for the FFP rules, to compete against the ones financially more powerful or the ones who don\u2019t respect FFP.\u2019 Mourinho was speaking publicly for the first time since being fined \u00a325,000 by the Football Association . Wilfried Bony is Manchester City's latest big-name signing - costing \u00a328million from Swansea . Mourinho insisted that Juan Cuadrado (left) was not a panic buy, but a reaction to Andre Schurrle's exit . Are you excited by Cuadrado? 'Normal.' Normal? 'Yeah. Normal.' What can he bring? 'I don't think it's the best thing for him that I speak about expectations. He needs his time, as everyone does. He will have his time. It's not a panic buy. It's a reaction to Schurrle, a departure that is not a panic buy because he's a player we've known for a long, long time. 'I've coached in his league for two seasons. We are happy with our business. Schurrle is a player we like very, very much but the business was very good. We are happy with it.' Any regret with Schurrle? 'No. No. We are happy with what he gave us. We are happy with the investment we did on him, one and a half years ago. We are happy with the profit we made in this transfer window. Hopefully we made him a better player. Hopefully he can have success in the future because we like him very much.' You never seem to win at Villa Park... why is this? 'Because the opponents score more goals than us, or sometimes the same number of goals.' They're the team with the least goals, you're the team with the most... hot favourites? 'I don't have to speak about Aston Villa.' What did you learn from that defeat last year? 'I learned nothing that I hadn't learned before that. There are matches that are impossible to win and you have to be smart enough to understand that. Afer so many years in football, there are matches that I clearly know it's impossible to win.' How many sides are there in the title race? 'That's not my problem. We are one side. It's up to the others to wonder whether they are title contenders or not. We consider we are, even if sometimes it's more difficult that it might be. But we consider ourselves contenders.' Team news? 'Filipe [Luis] is injured. The player [Diego Costa] is suspended.' Fabregas? 'I told you. Filipe is injured and the player who is suspended is suspended. Everybody (else) is fit.' Where will Cuadrado play in your team? 'Goalkeeper impossible because we don't need him there. Central defenders we don't need, and he's too small. After that he can play everywhere.' Is he ready now? 'I think he can, unless the Premier League or FA say some rule stops him.' Can Mohammed Salah come back? 'He's a Chelsea player who is on loan. He's our player. When we sell the players, they're not ours. But he is our player.' Are you proud of the business you've done in the last few windows? 'That's not my job at the club. You have to give credit to the people in the club who deal with numbers. They deserve credit for that.' Does that game at Villa Park still rankle with you? 'I don't speak about it. I don't have to speak about it.' Drogba or Remy tomorrow? 'Yes. One (of them).' Five points clear, Capital One Cup final, Champions League last 16, you should be enjoying it. You don't appear to be? Is that fair? 'I'm enjoying my work with my players. When I like my players, when I like my squad, I'm much more happy, more motivated to work, and this is the case.' It's just when you speak to us? 'Speak to you? You know why I'm here, so you cannot expect that I'm super happy to be here.' So you're here because you have to be here? 'Yes.' Could Cuadrado start? Or does he need a bit longer to settle down? 'I'm going to repeat the words I said three weeks ago, so many now people can understand. I said, he fits into the Fiorentina and Colombia's team. At this moment, he fits in Colombia and Chelsea teams.' Is he at the right physical level? 'He trained just two days. I cannot say much. The business situation almost to the last minute on Monday, he had to go to Paris for visas and the legal situation on the Tuesday. He only trained here a couple of days. I cannot say much.' Why didn't you speak to the media before City? 'Because, if you want, you can make a silence very noisy. It depends what you want to do. You could. You could. You could make noise with my silence, because you know the reason for my silence. It depends on you. If I was a journalist, from silence I could make lots of words.' All because of Costa's ban? 'Not just (that).' How do you reflect on that suspension? 'I don't reflect, because maybe I'll be punished if I reflect. Maybe they can read my reflection, and I don't want that.' Any word on Kurt Zouma's progression? 'Good. Very good.' Do you expect more from him still? 'A kid of 20, I expect always to improve.' Are you pleased with your position? 'I feel the distance could be much bigger. If I analysed \u2013 which I'm not going to do \u2013 the last five, six, seven matches, we could, we should have a bigger difference.' Why no new deal announced with Hazard? 'Why should it be officialised? Why? What's the problem? He has a contract with Chelsea for two or three more years. Are you worried? I'm not worried. I'm not worried.' Varane at 18, now Zouma at 20 with Chelsea... are you impressed by both players, the future of the French team? 'I think the French federation should write me a letter to thank me because I think they have now the two best young defenders in the world. Not the two 'best', because they are young. There are final products, mature players of 25, 28, 30 years of age. But as young defenders, can you imagine what Zouma and Varane could represent in a couple of years? Didier [Deschamps] should be very happy with that. For sure.' Do you expect to be fined by the Premier League for not attending the media conferences? 'You know, the only surprise I had in relation for that was not to be punished when I was pushed by another manager. Apart from that, I can expect everything.' Are you thinking about PSG? 'No. Three matches to play before that. I don't have time. I have to prepare Aston Villa, Everton and, after that, yes. After Everton I will prepare for PSG.' How did University affect your life? 'Every experience you have in life helps you to be what you are. University was five years of my life. For sure, it made a contribution to what I am. I cannot measure it. I can't say it's more important than being a manager's son, or more important than being an assistant to other managers.

A four year war ripped through a group of chimpanzees in Tanzania in the early 1970s, fracturing the community . Chimpanzees are often photographed huddled in groups grooming each other and relaxing in trees, but they are also capable of usurping dominant males in vicious power struggles and waging wars that last for years. A brutal four year war ripped through a group of chimpanzees in Gombe, Tanzania in the early 1970s, fracturing the community and leaving some members dead. Now scientists have taken a fresh look at the chimp conflict, which was recorded by primatologist Jane Goodall to reveal similarities in how chimpanzee and human societies break down. Dame Goodall witnessed the violent and sustained fighting of the apes first hand and called it a war. She had set up a feeding station at Gombe to try and unravel why the conflict escalated from what was a harmonious group. Jospeh Feldblum of Duke University, North Carolina, has examined her field notes to build an in-depth model of the chimpanzee\u2019s social network. Dame Jane made incredibly detailed notes detailing which apes arrived at the feeding station at the same time and from which direction they travelled, New Scientist reported. Previously, scientists had estimated the strength of relationships between the amount of time two chimps spent together, but now Dr Feldblum\u2019s team has entered Dame Jane\u2019s data collected between 1968 and 1972 into a model to track how the group\u2019s relationship changed. Scientists have taken a fresh look at the chimp conflict, which was recorded by primatologist Jane Goodall to reveal similarities in how chimpanzee and human societies break down . It suggests that the group was one happy family until 1971, until they divided into two groups. While they are not completely sure what sparked the conflict, an alpha male known as Leakey died at the close of 1970. Dr Feldblum told a meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists in Calgary, Canada: \u2018As soon as Leakey died they started splitting. He seems to have been a bridge between the northern and southern chimps. A younger chimp called Humphrey stepped into the power vacuum but he was challenged by two apes from the southern group called Hugh and Charlie. The study suggests that the group (stock image used) was one happy family until 1971, until they divided into two groups. While they are not completely sure what sparked the conflict, an alpha male known as Leakey died at the close of 1970 . The apes followed wither Humphrey or the southern brothers and a four year battle began, resulting in the deaths of seven males from the brother\u2019s \u2018rebel\u2019 group. While chimpanzees are known for their caring group dynamics, groups of Humphrey\u2019s \u2018army\u2019 would sneak behind rebel lines, pick a target and beat him up. Dr Feldblum discovered that it was possible to predict whether the chimp would support Humphrey or become a rebel and that the situation witnessed in the jungle resembles a power struggle in human society. He thinks that groups of chimpanzees might explain how human-like societies evolve. They have long been held as an almost human-like relative. But researchers have discovered chimpanzees have almost the same personality traits as humans. Georgia State University research shows some of those traits have a neurobiological basis, and that those traits vary according to the biological sex of the individual chimpanzee. They found the most fundamental personality trait for chimpanzees is dominance \u2013 that is, whether an animal is a generally dominant and undercontrolled 'Alpha,' or a more playful and sociable 'Beta.' But those two categories can be broken down statistically into smaller personality traits in ways that echo the personality structures researchers have found in child and adult human subjects. Alpha personalities, for example, statistically break down into tendencies toward dominance and disinhibition. Beta personalities, on the other hand, show low dominance and positive emotionality.Further analysis shows these lower order traits also can be statistically broken down into their constituent parts.The research team identified five personality factors that combine differently in each individual chimpanzee: conscientiousness, dominance, extraversion, agreeableness and intellect."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Jane Goodall observed a four-year war among Gombe's chimpanzees, leading to societal breakdown.

As would be expected, coping has been hard. \"It's a strange moment when you wake up in the morning and for that brief second everything is as it was,\" she says. \"And then you realize that nothing is ever as it was -- and never will be again.\" On Monday, after putting themselves \"in a little cocoon,\" as she put it, Hockley decided it was time to tell the world about Dylan. \"He was autistic,\" she says, \"but incredibly empathetic.\" \"He just wanted to have fun.\" Most of all, Dylan loved to bounce on a trampoline in the family's backyard, remembers his father. \"I'd say, 'Go out on the trampoline!'

After gay marriage rights died at the polls dozens of times in the past, on Tuesday they passed in at least two states. Rarely do popular votes reflect such dramatic social changes. The result: Maryland and Maine will now allow couples like Chyrino Patane and James Trinidad to tie the knot. The Maryland couple has been together for seven years, and now, after the historic vote, they plan to marry in the next six months to a year. \"Both families will be at the wedding,\" Patane said. But the win was hard fought and the margin of victory was small. \"We've lost at the ballot box 32 times,\" said Paul Guequierre of Human Rights Campaign. \"History was made tonight.\" In Maine, Erica Tobey and Ali Ouellette wed in September, but only now will the women's marriage be recognized under Maine law. \"It's hard to overstate the national significance of this vote,\" Marc Solomon, campaign director at Freedom to Marry, said of the Maine referendum. Related: French ministers back same-sex marriage . In Maryland, where just 51.9% of voters approved gay marriage rights, \"It was a little bit pins and needles,\" said Human Rights Campaign's Kevin Nix. \"It was going to be a close call all along.\" A similar ballot measure in Washington state is pending. And in Minnesota, voters rejected a measure that would have banned same-sex marriage. Pollsters got a hint of the coming change. Recent national surveys have shown shifting attitudes toward same-sex marriage, with a majority of Americans now approving of marriages between two men or two women. A June CNN/ORC poll, for example, reflected such a shift in opinion in the U.S. Support has been growing for decades. In the 1990s, most Americans told pollsters they did not know anyone close to them who was gay. By 2010, the number of Americans who said they had a gay or lesbian close friend or family member was 49%. This year, that number stands at 60%. Maryland, Maine approve same-sex marriage . Election Day brought two additional gains for proponents of same-sex marriage: Wisconsin elected America's first openly lesbian senator, Democrat Tammy Baldwin, and President Obama became the first president to openly support same-sex marriage and get re-elected. Wisconsin's Baldwin is first openly gay person elected to Senate . \"I have never been this happy after an election in my 17 years of voting,\" said Derek Hurder from Hampden, Maine, who's been with his partner, Chris McLaughlin, for a year and a half. They're not yet ready for marriage, but they were elated about having the option. And they both voted to re-elect the president. The change in attitude makes them feel more comfortable, but that has its limits. \"I wouldn't feel safe walking down the street holding hands,\" Hurder said. Patane and Trinidad share their Catholic faith and are despondent that the church won't recognize their union. \"I believe in a religious marriage,\" Trinidad said. \"I recognize that it's going to be a nonreligious wedding.\" Tobey and Ouellette, who met four years ago, tied the knot last September -- in a church. \"We are affiliated with the United Methodist Church, which on the whole does not support same-sex marriage,\" Tobey said. But their church made a hearty exception. \"We had three pastors who know us and love us and agreed to do that for us.\" The legal situation led the couple to do things in reverse order. After their wedding, they applied for a name change. Now that the referendum has passed, they'll apply for a marriage license. Maine should begin granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples in mid-December, according to same-sex marriage supporters at Freedom to Marry. What the measures say . The two measures that passed, called \"Question 1\" in Maine and \"Question 6\" in Maryland, contain similar language. The words man and woman \"relating to the marital relationship or familial relationships must be construed to be gender-neutral for all purposes,\" the Maine measure says. Maryland's ballot reads, \"Civil marriage laws allow gay and lesbian couples to obtain a civil marriage license.\" Both measures also explicitly mention the right of clergy to refuse to wed gay and lesbian couples if it goes against their religious convictions. \"This chapter does not require any member of the clergy to perform or any church, religious denomination or other religious institution to host any marriage in violation of the religious beliefs of that member of the clergy, church, religious denomination or other religious institution,\" Maine's Question 1 states. The governments of Maine and Maryland had passed laws permitting same-sex marriage, but activists opposed to the laws collected enough signatures to put them on a ballot, said Fred Sainz, a spokesman for Human Rights Campaign, which raised $32 million for its campaigns on the referendums that included radio and television ads, social media strategy and on-the-ground canvassing by thousands of volunteers. Opponents of same-sex marriage say the new laws in both states will redefine marriage for everyone as a genderless union and endanger the fabric of society. \"Such a radical change in the definition of marriage will produce a host of societal conflicts that government -- exercising its enormous enforcement powers -- will have to resolve,\" argues Maryland Marriage Alliance. The group also published an online opinion by parents stating that legalizing same-sex marriage would lead to the promotion of homosexuality in school curriculum. Election results raise questions about Christian right's influence . Sainz believes the campaigns supporting the Maine measure paid off. In 2009, a similar referendum in Maine failed when voters rejected the governor's decision to allow same-sex marriage. Tuesday's results represent a remarkable turnaround. \"The secret to our success is that we won over hearts and minds,\" Sainz said. \"Americans are fair and want to see their gay and lesbian friends, co-workers and family members have the freedom to marry.\" Thirty-eight states have passed bans on marriages between people of the same gender, mostly by amending their constitutions to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. In the six states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York -- and the District of Columbia where gays and lesbians have previously won marriage rights, it was because of actions taken by judges or legislators, not voters. On election night, Tobey joined friends as they all watched results on TV. She wasn't expecting Maine's ballot to pass. But then they heard the news. \"I said: 'Hey, did that just happen?' \" She did a double take. CNN's Rose Arce contributed to this report."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Maryland and Maine approved same-sex marriage rights via 'Question 6' and 'Question 1' respectively, while Minnesota rejected a ban.

The last leg of the fastest road in America opened on Wednesday where the speed limit is 85mph. The final 41-mile stretch of Texas Highway 130 was finally finished after three years of construction. The toll road is intended to alleviate the crowded Interstate 35 corridor between Austin and San Antonio, which are two of the state's largest metropolitan areas. Scroll down for flyover of the new high-speed road . Controversial: The 85 mph speed limit has been approved for a 41-mile-long toll road near the increasingly crowded Interstate 35 corridor between Austin and San Antonio . The new stretch will be from . Mustang Ridge, ten miles south of Austin's international airport, . to Interstate 10, just east of Seguin. A 50-mile stretch bypassing . Austin is already open. Tolls . for cars displaying an electronic toll tag will be about . 15 cents per mile. But no tolls will be collected until November 11. The new stretch of high-speed road has prompted fears that fatalities could increase. 'The research is clear that when speed limits go up, fatalities go up,' said Russ Rader, a spokesman for the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Higher speed limits get people to their destinations faster, Rader said, 'but the trade-off is more crashes and more highway deaths.' A 2009 report in the American Journal of Public Health studied traffic fatalities in the U.S. from 1995 to 2005 and found that more than 12,500 deaths were attributable to increases in speed limits on all kinds of roads. Speed strip: The map shows exactly where motorists can hit the gas . The study also said that rural . highways showed a 9.1 per cent increase in fatalities on roads where . speed limits were raised, but did not cite specific numbers in those . instances. There are no longer any roads in the . U.S. with no speed limit like Germany's autobahn with most top speeds being 75mph. Some highways in rural . West Texas and Utah have 80 mph speed limits. The . Texas Legislature last year approved 85 mph limits for some new . stretches of road.\u00a0 The . Texas Transportation Commission, which is appointed by Gov. Rick Perry, . approved the 85 mph speed limit at a public meeting on August 30. A . transportation department spokesman said commissioners would not comment . on their decision. Agency officials had previously said they would study the toll road's topography, the speeds that most drivers were reaching, and the safety of access points and cross sections before approving the 85 mph speed limit. 'Safety is our top priority and tests have shown the designated speed is a safe one,' agency spokeswoman Veronica Beyer said. Record speeds: Map shows top speed limits across the U.S . Alan Guckian, who lives in Austin and regularly drives to Seguin to visit family, said he'll likely use the road for convenience and the pleasure of driving fast. 'I would love it,' Guckian said. 'Sometimes it's fun to just open it up.' Steve Marcy sometimes uses another part of the toll road on his daily commute from Round Rock, north of Austin, to his job in San Antonio. The section he drives now has an 80 mph speed limit. Marcy said he'd be comfortable driving 85, but would be concerned about others driving vehicles that are not in good condition. 'A tire blowout (at 85 mph) could be a big hazard,' Marcy said. Chris Lippincott, spokesman for SH 130 Concession Co. that is building the road, said the company is committed to operating a safe highway. 'On any road, drivers hold the key to safety based on traffic, travel conditions and the capabilities of their own vehicles,' Lippincott said. Toll prices have not yet been set for the new section. Marcy predicted the higher speed limit will attract new drivers, but said most won't think it's worth the cost of the tolls.

I can't say in any way that we shirk from it. We welcome it.\" A crush of cameras and journalists follows Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end, each time he appears in court, including Thursday, when a grand jury indicted him on a first-degree murder charge in the execution-style shooting death of friend Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, who is being held without bail, has pleaded not guilty. His attorney, Michael Fee, calls Hernandez an innocent man and says \"there has been an incredible rush to judgment in this case.\" According to a biography on his office's website, Sutter has worked to solve old homicides and \"has employed a series of new and aggressive strategies to attack the problem of gun violence.\" He was elected in 2006 and re-elected four years later. The Democrat lost a bid for Congress in 2012. Neither Sutter nor Fee can speak to the evidence because of a court-imposed gag order. \"We have won 14 out of our last 15 murder trials,\" Sutter said. \"I think that's a pretty darn good record.\" The next step in Hernandez's case is his arraignment, during which he'll be informed of the crimes he is charged with. Hernandez also faces five weapons charges. Co-defendant Ernest Wallace, who was allegedly in the car with Hernandez the night Lloyd was killed, also was indicted. He was charged with being accessory after the fact to murder. The grand jury also has indicted Tanya Singleton, Hernandez' cousin, for contempt of court. She's charged with refusing to testify before a grand jury, despite being granted immunity. Lloyd's body was found June 17, riddled with five bullets in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez' luxury home in North Attleborough. From there, it's roughly a 20 minute drive to the New England Patriots' Gillette Stadium. Authorities have said Hernandez, Carlos Ortiz and Wallace picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment. Sources have told CNN that Ortiz, who is facing a weapons allegation, is cooperating with authorities. Sutter won't say whether Ortiz is getting a special deal. \"Mr. Ortiz is charged with a serious crime,\" Sutter told CNN. \"Whether or not he's indicted remains to be seen, but right now, he's not getting a pass.\" In search warrant affidavits for her home, investigators allege Singleton helped Wallace escape by buying him a bus ticket to Florida.

Between them they will represent more than 500,000,000 people. About 375 million EU citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote. But few understand how the low-profile Parliament affects the lives of EU citizens. Here are answers to the most frequently asked questions about the contest. Who will be voting, when and where? About 375 million EU citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote in the election of the parliament members for a five-year term. The elections will be held on Thursday, June 4 in the UK and the Netherlands. There will be voting on Friday, June 5 in Ireland and the Czech Republic. And it will begin on Saturday, June 6 in Cyprus, France, Italy, Latvia, Malta and Slovakia. The other countries will conduct their voting on Sunday, June 7. Elections will take place in all 27 member countries of the EU, with the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania included for the first time. How many MEPs are there and how many does each country elect? There will be 736 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the new assembly. The number each country has varies according to its population. Germany, with a population of 82 million, the biggest among EU states, will have 99 members. Malta, with a total population of just 410,000, will have only 5. Will that number stay the same if the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect? No. The Lisbon Treaty, designed to give the EU a new streamlined constitution for the EU (and to increase the powers of the European Parliament,) has been put on ice following its rejection in a referendum in Ireland, the only country to give electors a direct voice. But the Irish are due to vote again in the autumn. If they then vote Yes and all remaining EU states ratify the treaty, then the Parliament will be increased from 736 to 751 members on a different distribution formula. That means that 15 'ghost MEPs', will be elected on June 7, entitled to attend the Parliament but not to vote in it until the Lisbon Treaty goes through. What election system is used? That varies according to the individual states represented, but all will be using some variant of proportional representation. In some countries candidates will all be on a single national list, making the entire country a constituency. Others elect MEPs from regional constituencies. Many countries set a threshold, insisting that parties have to gain an overall proportion of the vote -- 5 per cent in France and Germany, 4 per cent in Sweden or Austria -- to qualify for any allocation of seats. Whom do the MEPs represent? Most would-be MEPs contest the elections with the endorsement of national political parties. National parties such as the Christian Democrats in Germany or the Labour Party in Britain put up approved lists of candidates. But when they are in the European Parliament the MEPs mostly operate in wider groups of left or right such as the Socialist Group (PES), the Liberal Group (ELDR) or the European Greens. The main conservative grouping is the European Peoples Party (EPP). However, David Cameron, the national leader of Britain's Conservatives, has withdrawn his members from the EPP, regarding it as too federalist in its approach. The groups work as a bloc when they can and have \"whips\" designed to make them as cohesive as possible. What powers do the MEPs have? Much legislation in member states actually originates at a European level. National legislatures pass laws which have begun life as directives from the European Commission, the EU executive arm, which the MEPs have helped to shape. They are the only elected part of the European apparatus which is otherwise dominated by European Councils (meetings of the prime ministers or finance or trade or interior ministers from the 27 nations) or the European Commission. Do MEPs really make much difference to ordinary people's lives? It may not feel like it, day to day, but MEPs often have more influence over the shaping of European legislation which filters down to national parliaments than the members of those national parliaments do when the laws get to them. Recent EU laws which have affected citizens directly include the \"roaming directive\" which restricted the charges mobile phone companies can impose on customers for calls in countries other than their own. EU directives have helped initiate the era of cut-price air travel. It was the EU which determined that telephone and data companies had to keep records for at least two years to help counter terrorism . And the so-called \"REACH\" directive has forced businesses to disclose what chemicals they use in their products and to ensure that they are safe. Because driving legislation through the European Parliament requires the building of cross-party coalitions more than 50 percent of amendments proposed in the European Parliament end up as law. That is why company lobbyists spent much time in Brussels trying to make their case to MEPs. But does the Parliament have any muscle? It has the rather drastic power to sack the European Commission. It also holds public hearings on newly-appointed Commissioners. The Parliament also has significant powers over how much of the European Union budget is spent. Although most legislation originates with the Commission, if more than 50 percent of MEPs back a resolution calling for new laws in a particular area the the Commission has to get down to work to propose some. The EU is one of the largest aid donors in the world, dispensing some $15 billion a year across five continents and MEPs have a significant say in that. Where is the European Parliament situated? Most of its meetings are held in Brussels close to the officials whose draft legislation is examined by the Parliament's subject committees. But, at a considerable cost, some plenary meetings are also held in Strasbourg, an arrangement which the French government has fought long and hard to maintain."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The European Parliament election, using proportional representation, will elect 736 MEPs from 27 EU countries.

He painted a picture of a strong economy that is open to those who are \"ready to be partners\" and invest in Russia. Follow the action live on CNN.com . This year Davos, a picturesque Swiss ski resort, is hosting nearly 40 world leaders and more than 2,000 executives. The world's top policymakers gather annually to discuss global issues, and are this time meeting under the banner of \"resilient dynamism.\" Medvedev sought to position himself as a reformer in a country that is moving determinedly forward. \"Russia is an open country, whatever they might think or say,\" he said, referring to critics of its record on corruption and governance issues. Russia's unemployment rate, at a little over 5%, is the lowest among developed countries, he said, and it also has an extremely low level of foreign debt. Quest: U.S. economy to dominate Davos . \"We need to see investment growing by 10% annually,\" he said. \"Therefore we are interested in attracting large-scale foreign investment.\" That amount of investment expansion is needed to push Russia's economy beyond 4% growth, he said. But Medvedev acknowledged that Russia needs to do a much better job of attracting foreign direct investment. Russia ranks very low in global corruption indices, which has held back investment despite a sizable population of 142 million. Medvedev said his government's priority is to improve public governance. But, he said, this is not a problem unique to Russia. Is the rise of China creating conflict? \"It's nothing new --- humanity has been facing these problems for centuries, if not millennia,\" he said. \"The more law and order, the more thieves and robbers. In that sense, little has changed.\" Medvedev stressed that Russia is an open market now and pointed to membership in the World Trade Organization as a indication of that. The country's next priority is to gain membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, composed of the world's industrialized nations, he said. Interactive: Europe's tale of boom and bust . The prime minister suggested this sends a strong message to the world, even though both structures \"are not perfect,\" in his view. He also spoke of the need to create an equal playing field for all businesses and to create a \"single economic space\" with Russia's neighbors, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific. But the prime minister dismissed suggestions that this is an effort to somehow recreate the Soviet Union, saying Russia wants to play in the global market. Interactive: How's your economic mood? \"There is no going back to the past,\" he said. Executives have not been convinced in the past that Medvedev and Russian President Vladimir Putin are on the same page. But the prime minister stressed that Russia has a global outlook and will continue dialogue with its European friends and partners. \"We are building our cooperation,\" he said, acknowledging that unilateral action could have \"dire implications.\" Medvedev said the G-20, which brings together the world's major economies, is becoming increasingly efficient and that this has helped limit the extent of the global economic crisis. \"We need to use modern technologies, crowd sourcing,\" he said. \"Those technologies change the status and enhance the legitimacy of decisions made in government.\" Davos 2013: New year, same old problems? The speech echoed one Medvedev gave at Davos as his country's president in 2011, when he also pushed foreign investment in Russia while acknowledging that reforms were needed. Russia last month assumed the rotating presidency of the G-20. \"The Russian presidency's main task will be to focus the G-20's efforts on developing measures to stimulate economic growth and create jobs,\" Putin said at the time. Few are likely to dispute Medvedev's comments on the need for Russia to prioritize governance issues. Russia ranked 133 out of 174 in Transparency International's 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index. Ahead of the World Economic Forum, the non-governmental group's chairwoman, Huguette Labelle, called on countries and businesses to change the way they work, for everybody's sake. \"Future prosperity will always be undermined by corruption, excessive risk-taking, a lack of transparency and other unethical practices,\" she warned. Pavel Khodorkovsky, the son of jailed Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and president of the U.S.-based Institute of Modern Russia, also wrote an open letter to those at the World Economic Forum in which he highlighted the plight of his father. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who backed an opposition party, has been in jail since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 on charges of tax evasion and fraud. Russia has faced wide criticism over his treatment, with the United States and others accusing it of \"selective prosecution\" and abuse of the legal system. His son, in his letter to policymakers at Davos, called on them to raise the issue of the former Yukos chief executive's continued imprisonment and urge support for the rule of law in Russia. \"Ending corruption is not just a human rights issue,\" Pavel Khodorkovsky said. \"The proliferation of corruption remains a huge impediment to direct foreign investment. \"Both U.S. and Russian officials have publicly acknowledged Russia's weak property rights and rampant corruption are reasons to avoid doing business in Russia. This is thwarting job creation and starving Russian businesses of the capital they need to grow.\" Medvedev's comments come amid frosty relations with the United States after Putin signed a law in December prohibiting Americans from adopting Russian children. The move by Russian politicians was widely seen as retaliation for a law that U.S. President Barack Obama signed December 14. That bill, called the Magnitsky Act, imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on those it considers human rights abusers in Russia."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "At Davos, Medvedev invited foreign investment, emphasizing Russia's low unemployment, foreign debt, WTO membership, and G-20 presidency.

Bob Richards: Aiming for the Moon . Richards was just one of many children left wide-eyed and inspired by the moon landings. But for him, they were a false start. \"I had this enormous expectation that I would have an experience in space. It just didn't happen,\" Richards says. Man stepped on the moon, but only to prove a point. \"We faltered,\" he explains. \"We didn't continue our operations on the moon; we didn't go to Mars.\" Now, Richards and his colleagues are bringing their childhood dreams to life, as part of the burgeoning NewSpace movement, which has sparked a renaissance in space exploration. The children of the moon landings have grown up: they now hold the positions of power to make their dreams come alive. \"They want to make the world of 'Star Trek,' of '2001,' and now ... they're in charge of NASA, they're in charge of the private companies, and they're making it happen,\" he explains. Richards says his path to the stars was \"inevitable.\" Inspired by science fiction authors like his friend, Arthur C. Clarke, visionaries like Carl Sagan and movies like \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" he studied aerospace and industrial engineering at Ryerson University, then physics and astronomy at the University of Toronto, before moving to Cornell to study space science, where he became special assistant to Sagan. Now, Richards is the ringleader behind Odyssey Moon, a company formed on the Isle of Man to pursue commercial ventures on the moon. The team were the first to enter the Lunar X prize, a Google-sponsored competition with a $20million jackpot for the first privately funded team to land a robotic spacecraft on the moon and send images and data back to Earth. But the X Prize is not Richards' only goal. He thinks that there are fortunes to be made in space -- and he plans to be the first lunar entrepreneur. \"We believe that beyond the prize, there's actually ongoing commerce on the surface of the moon,\" he reveals. Innovation and collaboration, both important drivers in the Odyssey Moon team, are the key to humanity's future, believes Richards. \"Space, by its nature, is an international endeavour,\" he says. \"Every space program will be successful based on the amount of international cooperation it's able to achieve.\" With that in mind, in 1987 he founded the International Space University, which educates students from all over the world in space technology. \"We're creating a universal planetary culture looking on space as an achievement and a goal for all humanity.\" For now, Richards' sights are set on the moon. \"The Google X Prize has certainly captivated my enthusiasm and interest, and I would certainly like to win that,\" he says. But he also sees Earth's satellite as a stepping stone to the stars. He confesses, \"If somebody was going to offer an X Prize for Mars, I'd be going for that ...\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Robert Richards, inspired by Arthur C.

Summer has arrived at last and sun-deprived Britons have been flocking to the country's beaches to bask in soaring temperatures after enduring weeks of soggy weather. But not everyone will be welcoming the respite from the rain. The sudden change in weather has come with an unfortunate side effect for hay fever sufferers - soaring pollen counts. The seemingly endless weeks of rain in the UK since spring have seen pollen-bearing grasses and weeds flourish. The tiny particles spread easily on humid days, and the current hot spell has seen an increase in the amount of pollen in the air. Heatwave: Brighton beach was swarmed with sunbathers yesterday, all eager to enjoy every minute of Britain's long awaited hot weather - but the rising temperatures come at a price for allergy sufferers . Lindsey McManus, from Allergy UK, said hay fever sufferers might see their symptoms flare up after the sudden change in weather. Tissues at the ready: The orange symbols on this map indicate high pollen counts over much of the UK . 'Because the weather has been so up and down people might be thinking they had got away with it,' she said, explaining that wet weather keeps levels of pollens that trigger hay fever lower. 'When it's warm weather, and it's a little bit breezy, (symptoms) are going to really kick in,' she said. 'Things like weeds and grasses and trees are all pollinated by the wind, and (the particles) are really small so winds carry them long distances.' Britain's estimated 16 million hay fever sufferers have already been warned that the chaotic weather could see the country's hay fever season last up to a month longer than usual. The season normally ends in July, but experts have said the freak weather could leave sufferers enduring sneezing fits, sore throats and watery eyes well into August. At the beginning of the month NHS Direct reported a 20 per cent increase in calls from hay fever sufferers during the early summer months compared to the same period in 2011. Patrick Sachon, health manager at the Met Office, said the settled, drier weather would be reflected in boosted pollen counts. 'The . unsettled weather this summer has led to a fluctuating pollen count but . as expected we have seen some very high levels when the weather has . been good,' he added.

Around 3,000 homes and businesses were flooded and people were swept to their deaths as Britain was battered by rain for weeks on end. The wet weather also saw roads closed off, cars marooned in flood water, and rivers bursting their banks. Even this month rainfall has hit 71.8mm, above the typical 69.6mm July average.

A five-year-old boy who was born with his bowel attached to his heart has already faced eight life-saving operations -and he has more to come. John-Joseph Lively, of Wallsend in North Tyneside almost died in his father's arms after contracting meningitis. He has endured multiple procedures on his heart and bowel and became the one of the first children in the country to have a pioneering surgery to flush out his bowel. Now the inspiring five-year-old has been nominated for a bravery award, in recognition of his fight to survive. Scroll down for video .

John Joseph (pictured left) loves playing football, computer games and Lego. Father John (pictured right) says he is inspired by his son, who manages to smile even when coming out of surgery . Father John Lively, 40, said his son's courage is infectious. He said: 'My little boy is my inspiration. I don't know anyone whose been through so much and come out smiling.' After he was born, doctors became worried about John Joseph as tests revealed his bowel was attached to his heart. Mr Lively said they were given difficult news about their newborn son straight away. He said: 'They also said he had a hole in his heart and that the valves were collapsing. 'We were told pretty much straight away that he was going to need open heart surgery.' At just nine-months-old, John-Joseph underwent the operation at Newcastle's Freeman Hospital. Straight after surgery he contract pneumonia and spent the next two weeks in intensive care. Operation after operation followed, not only to help repair his heart, but also his damaged bowel. John-Joseph also became one of the youngest children in the country to undergo an Antegrade Colonic Enema (ACE) procedure to help with his bowel condition. A small opening was made in his lower tummy, and a saline solution flushed in to wash out his colon and produce a bowel movement. But contracting meningitis meant he almost lost his life. Mr Lively said: 'He was so poorly, he contracted meningitis and almost died in my arms three different times.' Antegrade colonic enema, or antegrade continence enema (ACE) is a surgical procedure designed to make enemas easier and more convenient. The surgeon uses the appendix to create a channel between the bowel and the abdomen. An artificial opening called a stoma is then made in the surface of the abdomen. A catheter can be inserted into the stoma so that liquids can be passed into the bowel to wash out its contents through the anus. Source: NHS Choices . Today Mr Lively and his former wife Angela, 42, of South Shields, have been told their son faces the prospect of more heart surgery. But that is not stopping John-Joseph enjoying sports and activities. 'He's such a happy little chap,' added Mr Lively. 'He loves football, computer games and Lego. 'Don't get me wrong, we have our hard days but every time I see him laughing, it touches my heart and I think what an incredible inspiration he is.' John-Joseph has now been nominated for a Champion Child of Courage award by his local paper. Recently he also starred in a video for the Royal Victoria Infirmary to help other parents and children who are going through the ACE procedure.

Jonas Zmuidzinas, at Nasa's JPL. All the way up to 11: Nasa has developed a nearly perfect amplifiier, which will be used for everything from studying stars, galaxies and black holes to exploring the quantum world and developing quantum computers . Researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the California Institute of Technology, both in Pasadena, have developed a new type of amplifier for boosting electrical signals. An amplifier is a device that increases the strength of a weak signal. \u2018Amplifiers play a basic role in a wide range of scientific measurements and in electronics in general,\u2019 said Peter Day, a principal scientist at JPL and a visiting associate in physics at Caltech. \u2018For many tasks, current amplifiers are good enough. But for the most demanding applications, the shortcomings of the available technologies limit us.\u2019 One of the key features of the new amplifier is that it incorporates superconductors\u2014materials that allow an electric current to flow with zero resistance when lowered to certain temperatures. For their amplifier, the researchers are using titanium nitride and niobium titanium nitride, which have just the right properties to allow the pump signal to amplify the weak signal. Although the amplifier has a host of potential applications, the reason the researchers built the device was to help them study the universe. The team built the instrument to boost microwave signals, but the new design can be used to build amplifiers that help astronomers observe in a wide range of wavelengths, from radio waves to X-rays. \u2018It's hard to predict what all of the applications are going to end up being, but a nearly perfect amplifier is a pretty handy thing to have in your bag of tricks,\u2019 Zmuidzinas said. And by creating their new device, the researchers have shown that it is indeed possible to build an essentially perfect amplifier. \u2018Our instrument still has a few rough edges that need polishing before we would call it perfect, but we think our results so far show that we can get there.\u2019 The team recently described the new instrument in the journal Nature Physics. ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "NASA's JPL and Caltech have developed an amplifier using superconductors, specifically titanium nitride and niobium titanium nitride, as reported in Nature Physics.

Fraud: John Darwin has been forced to pay the State \u00a340,000 from his newly matured pension pot . The man who faked his own death in a canoe accident in order to claim life insurance was today ordered to pay back \u00a340,000 in compensation. John Darwin has so far repaid just \u00a3121 of the \u00a3679,073.62 he gained from the scam, which he orchestrated with his wife Anne. But after two private pensions matured, Teesside Crown Court ruled that he would have to hand over thousands of pounds to the Crown. Darwin, 63, from Hartlepool, did not challenge the application by the Crown to have the money removed from his bank accounts. Although the pensions were legitimately earned by Darwin during his work as a teacher and a prison officer, officials were still granted access to them in order to pay off the money he owes to the State. Prosecutor Jolyon Perks said that the defendant would have to hand over any money he manages to earn in the future. 'We believe it sends a strong signal to those who seek to benefit from their criminal conduct that these orders have teeth,' he said. 'They will be pursued and they will be rigourously enforced. The Proceeds of Crime Act is intended to be draconian.' Anne Darwin, who has now split from her husband, has repaid more than \u00a3500,000 under a separate order, and still owes another \u00a3177,000. The couple were both jailed for fraud after it emerged that they had made a false claim on Darwin's life insurance even though he was still alive and living in Panama. Outside court today, Tommy Maughan from the North East Regional Asset Recovery Team said: 'I'm pleased with the outcome today - Mr Darwin has now seen first-hand the full force of the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation in action. 'It's a robust law that allows police and prosecutors to make sure those who have benefited from crime pay back what they owe until their debt is paid. Repayment: Darwin, pictured outside Teesside Crown Court today, still owes more than \u00a3600,000 . 'The court assessed how much John Darwin benefited from crime some time ago, and today they have taken into account recently identified assets which the Judge has agreed can be confiscated. 'His full benefit from crime has still not been paid off, and if he comes into any substantial assets in the future we will again consider asking the court to revisit the Confiscation Order granted against him in 2009. 'Criminals should be warned that even if assets are gained legitimately this legislation can be used and their crimes may just come back to haunt them.' Partner in crime: Anne Darwin was jailed for her part in her husband's life insurance fraud . John Darwin left his children heartbroken when he failed to return from a canoeing trip near his home in Seaton Carew on Teesside in March 2002. He was reported missing, and after the wreckage of his canoe was found the next day he was officially presumed dead - allowing his wife Anne to claim thousands in life insurance. She used the money to repay the couple's debts and wipe out their mortgage - but in fact, John was living next door the whole time. In 2006, they moved to Panama, where they bought a tropical estate which they planned to turn into a hotel specialising in canoeing holidays. However, the next year Darwin decided he had to come back into the open in order to secure a long-term visa to continue living in Panama. He walked into a London police station in December 2007 - to the shock of his sons, who had assumed him long dead. Although Anne initially pretended not to have seen him for five years, a photograph soon emerged of the couple together in Panama, and their scam was exposed. In July 2008, the Darwins were convicted of fraud and sentenced to more than six years in prison each."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "John Darwin, who faked his death for insurance, lived in Panama after the scam.

We'd like to nominate an exception to that expectation: Criminal justice reform. Newt has talked about the need for \"confidence-building measures\" between the President and Republicans in Congress. The idea is that we should work on easier things first, so that we can work on harder things next. Transforming our nation's failed prison system looks like it could be easier now than anyone expected. Leaders in both parties agree on the need and direction for reform. They recognize that locking up millions of people for very long periods of time at ballooning costs is not a wise response to nonviolent crime. Warehousing nonviolent offenders for years behind bars has been an economic, moral and human catastrophe. The United States has 5% of the world's population, but 25% of its incarcerated population. During the past four decades, the rate of incarceration in the U.S. has more than quadrupled, costing us more than $80 billion a year. There are now roughly 2.3 million people in prison or in jail, which is nearly one in every 100 Americans. Today in a Florida prison, a 19-year-old man is serving a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for drug possession. His incarceration will cost taxpayers $60,000 a year. He will receive no job training, no education and no drug treatment. He will leave prison beaten down. He'll carry the stigma and the barriers that come with being a felon, making it difficult for him to find a job and more likely that he will end up back in prison. As a corrections system, this makes no sense. We must rethink our approach from the ground up. And for federal crimes, we can start by building on bipartisan reforms that are spreading across the country at the state level. In the true spirit of federalism, states have led the way in passing reforms that protect public safety, more effectively punish and correct nonviolent offenders, save taxpayers money and ensure hardened and violent criminals remain behind bars. In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal has implemented a bold overhaul of the state's criminal justice system, slashing prison spending and reducing harsh penalties for nonviolent offenses. The result has been a 20% reduction over five years in the number of African-American men incarcerated. In Texas, Gov. Rick Perry has been so successful at using probation, parole and sentencing reform to both reduce the prison population while also reducing crime that people have termed his approach  the \"Texas Model.\" Out west, California recently passed one of the most transformational examples of bipartisan criminal justice reform. Proposition 47, the \"Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act,\" was a sensible measure to reduce incarceration for nonviolent crimes and to increase investments in crime prevention, treatment and education. The initiative changed six low-level offenses, including simple drug possession, from felonies to misdemeanors, and will save California hundreds of millions of dollars each year in prison spending that wasn't working, reinvesting those savings into mental health and drug treatment, K-12 schools and victim services. While there is a lot to learn from the policy reforms brought about by Prop 47, there may be even more to learn from its politics. The initiative had the support of crime survivors, victims groups, business groups and 1,500 clergy across the state. Everyone from rapper Jay Z and the ACLU to Sen. Rand Paul and Grover Norquist lined up behind the measure. (We both endorsed it, too.) Conservative California businessman B. Wayne Hughes Jr. was the single largest individual donor to the effort, giving more than $1.25 million. Because of its broad-based support, Proposition 47 passed  by a huge margin of 59-41 percent. It even won in some conservative strongholds, such as Orange County and Riverside County. California isn't the only place where criminal justice reform did well on the ballot. Deal, and senators such as John Cornyn and Cory Booker were re-elected by big margins, campaigning in part on their criminal justice reform efforts. And in New Jersey, voters passed  a state constitutional amendment reforming the bail system that was championed by both Republican Gov. Chris Christie and the Drug Policy Alliance. If criminal justice reform can happen in places as diverse as Georgia, Texas, California and New Jersey, then it should be possible to bring similar reforms to the federal level in Washington, D.C. There are a number of good bipartisan bills in the U.S. Senate that should be our starting point. One of the most important is the \"Smarter Sentencing Act,\" authored by conservative Sen. Mike Lee and liberal Sen. Dick Durbin. It would reduce mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenses. Senators Rand Paul and Cory Booker have also introduced important, bipartisan legislation. Even more than the current debate in the Senate, however, the approaching 2016 election season offers the opportunity for the American people to make criminal justice reform a priority. Voters should demand of each presidential and gubernatorial candidate a vision for reducing incarceration and cutting prison spending while improving public safety and helping nonviolent offenders live full, productive lives within the law. In the interest of ensuring criminal justice reform is part of the conversation about who should be our next president, we will convene a national summit on criminal justice reform on March 26, 2015, under the banner of #cut50 -- a new bipartisan initiative of Rebuild the Dream, which Van leads, to help cut the prison population in half over the next 10 years. Our overreliance on prisons has failed America. It is past time for both political parties to come together and fix a bad system of their own making. We believe this moment offers a once-in-a generation opportunity for reforms that will save entire communities and transform the lives of millions of Americans. We must not let it pass."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Leaders agree on criminal justice reform, acknowledging the flawed system that incarcerates millions for nonviolent crimes at a cost of over $80 billion annually.

He was so close that Pracon could see down the barrel of his weapon. He was sure to get a direct hit. Pracon thought he was going to die. Another survivor, Otzar Fagerheim, described the gunman as having blond hair and pale skin. He carried three guns, he said. At times, he shot those guns with disarming calm, like he was shooting photographs. He even smiled, Fagerheim said. Pracon was surprised to hear the shooter speaking Norwegian. He was certain a compatriot could never commit such a heinous act. Pracon spoke back. \"Do you want to hurt a fellow Norwegian? Please, no. Don't shoot.\" Miraculously, the gunman pointed his weapon away. Instead, he aimed for those who were desperately trying to swim to safety. As though Pracon was too easy a target. As though it was more satisfying to shoot at a group of fleeing people, Pracon thought. He heard his friends begging for help. Some fell limp on Pracon. The gunman went away but returned to find Pracon again, hiding with about 10 others. The madness started again. More rounds of gunfire. He could hear so many of them say: \"Please don't shoot me.\" One by one, their voices were silenced. A woman next to him was shot in the leg. Pracon could see her wound was gaping. Pracon clung to the dead. Tried to play dead. It was the only way he knew to survive. He heard footsteps getting closer. He could hear the heavy breathing of the man. Then, \"boom!\" Pracon's world fell silent. His hearing was gone. But he could feel intense pain on the back of his left shoulder. He bore it, lay face down, and kept perfectly still. \"I am sure he intended to hit me in the head,\" Pracon said. The gunman missed by inches. 'I had to get out of there' That afternoon, before the carnage, Stine Renate Haheim spoke to her party's youth about violence against women and children. It's a big issue for the young member of parliament, who began her political career a decade ago in the youth movement. She came to idyllic Utoya island often for such gatherings -- 11 times, to be exact. It was \"the most beautiful adventure of the summer,\" she said. She drew inspiration from Utoya. It was an important place for people from all over Norway to gather to discuss the future of their own nation as well as the problems plaguing other parts of the world. It was a place to get away from the daily grind, the day-to-day debates in parliament, and think big. And most of all, Haheim said, Utoya was a place of fraternity, of peace. \"We love it there,\" she said. Everything changed Friday. It will be remembered from now on as a place where 85 people died, seemingly for no reason. Eskil Pedersen, a youth movement leader, assured everyone that they would be able to speak with counselors about the carnage they witnessed. \"We will not be threatened to silence,\" he said. \"We will continue fighting for what we believe in. This is the best way to honor the memory of those we have now lost. We will go back to Utoya.\" But it will be difficult. Haheim will hear the gunfire play over and over again in her head, just like she did Friday. After her speech Friday afternoon, she was informed about the explosion in downtown Oslo. Many of the youth camp attendees huddled for an informational meeting on what was happening to their colleagues in the government buildings. But when the shots rang out, the 600 people at the main building and surrounding camp scattered. Haheim quickly realized she should not be alone and followed others tumbling down the hill. Like Pracon, she hid behind boulders on the beach. When there was a lull in the shooting, she thought it was over. But then it started again. Terrifying minutes that seemed never-ending. She repositioned herself in another spot, away from the gunman's sight. She found herself with a girl, shivering in her underwear, who had shed her clothes in a desperate but failed bid to swim away. Haheim took off her jacket to warm her companion. \"What is your name? Where are you from? Nice to meet you,\" they said to each other. \"It was a conversation about nothing,\" Haheim said. That's how they found calm in that moment of fear. Haheim called her father, a police officer, on her mobile phone. \"The police are on their way,\" he reassured her. She imagined that all the police and ambulances in the area had rushed to Oslo after the bombings. So her father's words gave her relief. Maybe the madness would end soon. Shortly thereafter, she could hear helicopters overhead, and vehicles with sirens in the distance. She was one of the older people at the gathering. She felt a sense of obligation to calm the younger people around her. Some were still in their teens. \"You find some kind of way to get freakishly calm in that situation,\" she said. Finally, she heard someone say: \"The police are here. We are safe.\" She hugged the man next to her. But within moments, the shooting began again. They had all been deceived -- the gunman was wearing a police uniform. \"Run, run, run!\" Haheim shouted. The rocks were slippery. She stumbled, fell, picked herself up. She had to keep running. \"The only thing on my mind was that I had to get out of there,\" she said. 'Bloody, bloody mess' When real police officers finally showed up, the survivors were suspect. Were these more gunmen in uniform? \"Everyone started screaming, crying, begging the police to throw away their weapons,\" Pracon said. After about a two-hour ordeal, Pracon and Haheim were rescued -- Haheim without injury and Pracon with a gunshot wound that was closed up at the hospital. Police arrested a man the Norwegian media identified as Anders Behring Breivik, 32, a Norwegian who apparently had taken issue with his homeland's growing multi-culturalism. It was only many hours later, in his hospital bed, that Pracon began realizing the magnitude of the \"bloody, bloody mess.\" Recuperating after stitches Saturday, Pracon said fear was setting in anew. Now he would begin to discover the names of the dead. They were friends who would never again share a laugh with him. Police and rescue teams were still combing Utoya island -- 13 boats on the water and a meter-by-meter land search, said Sven Mollekleiv, president of Norwegian Red Cross. \"We have now also mothers and fathers who don't know if their sons or daughters are alive,\" Mollekleiv said. \"They are just waiting.\" Doctors cleared Pracon for solid food Saturday afternoon and he sought comfort in a plate of lasagna. \"It was a perfect dinner for me right now,\" he said. A moment of joy, perhaps. But for Pracon, Haheim and other survivors of the slaughter, a long journey of healing lies ahead."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Anders Behring Breivik attacked a Labour Party youth camp on Utoya island, killing 85 people.

The incident comes after 20 women, including former super model Janice Dickinson, stepped forward to accuse the comedian of unwanted advances, including drugging and then raping them. In 2005, a Temple University employee accused him of an assault and - although 13 women who claimed they had similar experience were willing to testify in the case - it was settled out of court. Then two months ago, after comedian Hannibal Buress went on a rant about the comedian during a stand-up set, scores of women started coming forward to accuse Cosby of rape. He has most recently been taken to court by a woman, Judy Huth, who claims she was just 15 when Cosby raped her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974. Cosby's lawyers have said she previously tried to extort him and have requested that the case is thrown out, saying the accusations are too old. Accused: Cosby, 77, has been accused of rape or sexual assaults by at least 20 women since October. Many of the alleged attacks took place decades ago when the women were aspiring actresses . As the allegations surfaced, NBC dropped a new project with the comedian, while Netflix also shelved a one-off comedy special planned for the day after Thanksgiving. He also resigned from Temple University's board of trustees, which he joined in 1982. And on Thursday, the Navy announced it is revoking the former sailor's title of honorary chief petty officer, saying the allegations against him are serious and conflict with the Navy's core values.

YOUR TV . Couples who have a TV in their bedroom have sex half as often as those who don\u2019t: that\u2019s a fact, supported by reputable research. Why? It stops you both talking, it robs you of sleep (the better rested we are, the healthier and higher our libido) and it keeps you grounded in reality. By keeping your laptop or iPad in your bedroom you destroy intimacy and distract from sex . God help us all, but reality shows like The Kardashian's suck some people into the trap of thinking what we watch on telly is actually real. It\u2019s not. Sex on telly is peppered with couples having more simultaneous orgasms than cups of tea. In real life, they\u2019re actually pretty rare. Tracey says that in order to have the best sex possible it is wise to choose a firmer bed . All of this leads to unrealistic expectations and constant disappointment with our sex lives. YOUR IPADS AND PHONES . Ditching the telly won\u2019t do a thing if you replace it with another device to distract you from sex and each other. Slip into bed and pull out your ipad or phone and the effect on your relationship is even worse! These gadgets are portable, so capable of destroying intimacy anywhere. Foreplay should begin way before you take your clothes off and if your partner\u2019s spent all night on their phone, giving other people attention, why would you want to give them yours? One recent study found it\u2019s especially harmful if one person uses technology more than the other - the second person feels ignored and insecure. Neither are emotions likely to trigger a bit of rumpy-pumpy. A SOFT, LUMPY BED . The best beds for good sex are firm with no hard edges. You need a firm foundation to master creative sex positions and to be able to sit or lean on the edges without hitting anything hard. Clean, fresh linen is inviting; scratchy, balled-up sheets, not so much (though there is something undeniably sexy about a crumpled bed that you both have just had sex in!). A few firm pillows are perfect for lifting and supporting body bits to make sex super comfy and those more adventurous positions more \u2018doable\u2019. SLOPPY SLEEPWEAR . Well-worn, snuggly track pants and wooly socks might make us feel cosy when it\u2019s cold outside, but they do little to get your partner hot and bothered. I\u2019m not suggesting tottering to bed in high heels and sexy stay-up stockings on Monday nights but aiming for a happy medium by choosing something that\u2019s at least a little flattering isn\u2019t too much to ask, surely?

David Schlosser said at an impromptu news conference frequently interrupted by protesters. But some protesters had voluntarily agreed to remove sleeping bags, pillows and housekeeping supplies, he said. On Friday, the National Park Service set a noon Monday deadline for protesters who have occupied the parks for months to remove their camping gear. Park officials said protesters would be allowed to remain around the clock and keep up tents, so long as one side of each tent remains open at all times, officials said. Georgia resident Dane Charles Primerano filed a complaint and motion for a temporary restraining order in U.S. District Court in Washington on Monday claiming that \"the term 'camping' is defined over-broadly.\" Acting as his own attorney, he argued that sleeping in the park \"is unavoidable for destitute participants in a long-term political assembly,\" adding that calling it camping \"implicitly and wrongly (suggests) that the behavior is somehow trivial, frivolous or optional.\" \"This is not about 'camping,'\" Primerano wrote. \"It is about preserving political discourse, a good more sacred than any warrior's statue, and infinitely more fragile than the park's Bermuda grass.\" The threat of arrest didn't deter many in the Occupy DC movement. On its official Twitter feed, the group claimed Monday evening that 50 to 75 protesters were on site -- including a \"bunch of new occupiers.\" \"I'm going to do the best I can to stay here,\" said Emily Margaret, who has been staying at the McPherson Park camp. \"If they want to arrest me, they can.\" John Zangas said many fellow protesters have removed prohibited gear from McPherson Park, but others have moved in and deliberately set up camp to challenge police. As Monday's noon deadline passed, protesters pulled the tarp over a statue of the park's namesake, Civil War Gen. James B. McPherson, to create what they called a \"tent of dreams.\" \"Let us sleep so we can dream,\" they chanted. Protesters have been camping in McPherson Park since October to rally against what they consider to be corporate greed and financial abuses. Protesters \"glitter-bomb\" senator outside D.C. gala . Occupy DC said in a statement posted on its website Sunday that members \"will defend the public space we have used as our center for activism,\" calling possible arrests of protesters a \"politically motivated attempt to suppress the free speech of the disenfranchised 99%.\" Pastor Brian Merritt of Washington's Palisades Community Church said area churches have discussed helping house some of the protesters overnight so that they could continue a 24-hour vigil if park police began enforcing the rules against overnight encampments. Whatever happens with the camps and police, Caty McClure said it would not alter her and fellow demonstrators' commitment to their cause or their activism. \"The park and the occupation of the park is a tactic. It's not the movement,\" she said, calling the camps \"a really important symbolic statement.\" \"If we can't sleep here, that does not end the movement,\" McClure said. One man was arrested Sunday after he allegedly went from tent to tent, removing notices from the Park Service. A video posted online showed the man walking away from police as officers tried to grab him. One officer used a Taser on the man, who fell to the ground and was handcuffed. Schlosser said Monday that the incident was under review. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee's website indicated that more than 15,000 people had signed an online petition criticizing the incident and calling on the Park Service to \"stop buckling to political pressure and to respect free speech on federal land.\" White House spokesman Jay Carney mentioned the general situation unfolding at the two parks, both blocks from the White House, in his daily press briefing Monday. \"Our position has been and continues to be that we need to balance First Amendment concerns of the right to demonstrate, the right to speak freely, with public safety concerns and public health concerns,\" he said. \"And we understand that local law enforcement as well as, in this case, the National Park Service and U.S. Park Police are weighing those considerations when they make these decisions. And that's appropriate.\" Until now, Occupy protesters have been allowed to remain under a Park Service interpretation that considered the activity a \"24-hour vigil.\" Two weeks ago, National Park Service Director Jonathan Jarvis said he saw no reason to move against the encampments. \"I think if there's any place in this country, Washington, D.C., is the place where we need to be the most tolerant of individuals that are exercising their First Amendment activities,\" he said. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa disagreed, saying Jarvis was \"completely out of line.\" \"It is not his job to interpret the Constitution over law,\" Issa said. Issa, who last month wrote a letter to U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar citing damage to part of a $400,000 renovation of McPherson Square, continued his criticism at a House hearing last week and came away unsatisfied with the Park Service's answers. Occupy DC is part of a larger activist surge that began last year in New York and quickly spread. While the protesters have highlighted a number of causes, the overarching theme has remained largely the same: populist anger over what activists portray as an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite. Occupy protesters in the nation's capital aren't the only ones who have found themselves at odds with authorities in recent days. Violent clashes, for instance, erupted last weekend in Oakland, California. Protesters trying to take-over a vacant convention center threw rocks, bottles and other objects Saturday afternoon at police, who responded with bean-bag rounds, tear gas and smoke grenades. Afterward, the activists criticized police as being heavy-handed, with police and city officials said the protesters instigated the violence. The Oakland demonstrators later got into a downtown YMCA and, eventually, City Hall. Once there, police said that protesters painted graffiti on walls, took down and burned an American flag and committed other acts of vandalism. Oakland police Chief Howard Jordan later said about 400 demonstrators were arrested. He said three police officers and two protesters were confirmed injured, though the Occupy Oakland forces on Twitter claimed that many more members of their ranks got hurt. City Hall reopened Monday after an extensive clean-up effort. Also on Monday, protesters in Charlotte, North Carolina, were given an afternoon deadline to remove tents from the site of the old city hall, CNN affiliate WCNC reported. Afternoon video from the scene showed police taking down and carrying off several tents, and at least one protester was seen being carried away by authorities. \"We're doing the right thing, peacefully and quietly,\" protester Malachi Vinson told WCNC. \"We're expressing ourselves in a better way than anyone else would.\" CNN's Ed Payne, Athena Jones, Joe Sutton, Courtney Battle, Paul Courson, Brian Todd and Dugald McConnell contributed to this report."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The U.S. Park Police, under the National Park Service, enforced a camping ban in Washington parks, balancing First Amendment concerns with the Occupy DC movement.

A combination of snow, wind and fog caused the cancellation of Thursday's super G in Lenzerheide, just a day after the downhill was scrapped for similar reasons, all of which prompted Hirscher's chief rival Aksel Lund Svindal to withdraw from this weekend's slalom. The Norwegian had hoped to narrow Hirscher's lead of 149 points in the two events he excels in but Svindal's World Cup hopes became decidedly frosty after these were canceled - since the Austrian is more adroit at the slalom. \"I see no point in competing in the slalom now,\" said the overall champion in 2007 and 2009. \"It might have been a consideration had the two races not been canceled. But that has not been the case.\" Svindal's decision to miss Sunday's season-ending slalom means he cannot overhaul Hirscher's lead, with only 100 points awarded to the winner of any race. Slalom is not his strong point, with the 30-year-old having never done better than finish sixth in a World cup race in the discipline. Disappointed by his failure to pits his wits on the slope, the speedy Svindal was nonetheless quick to praise Hirscher -- classifying the Austrian in the same bracket as some of the best skiers in history. \"He had a fantastic season, worthy of great skiers of the past like (Sweden's Ingemar) Stenmark or (Italy's Alberto) Tomba,\" added the Norwegian. Even though he was disappointed by the cancellation of Thursday's races, the move did confirm Svindal as the winner of this year's super G. The day went badly for organizers with an initial delay of over three hours for bad weather followed by another postponement after the first racer, Gauthier de Tessieres, fell in high winds. Nine racers managed to finish despite the gusting winds before Kroell, last year's downhill World Cup winner, crashed at the same spot as De Tessieres fell before being flown to hospital after 45 minutes of on course treatment for a broken shoulder. Hirscher told reporters it was difficult to celebrate his impending triumph on a day when his fellow Austrian, who received a tweet of support from his compatriot, had been so badly injured. \"Despite my young age, I've already learned many things. In life, being slalom world champion is not the most important thing,\" the 24-year-old said in philosophical fashion. \"There are things that surpass that -- such as my family, Laura (his girlfriend), my friends and being healthy.\" Tina Maze was another left with mixed emotions, despite the fact that the Slovenian took her third crystal globe of the season on Thursday, adding the super G to the overall and giant slalom cups. This came just 24 hours after she lost out on the World Cup downhill crown to America's Lindsey Vonn in similar fashion, with bad fog canceling the race with the Slovenian trailing by just a single point. \"I don't really like this kind of days when you don't get the chance to show your skills on the slope,\" she told the official FIS website. \"But in the end today is a good day for me, while yesterday wasn't really. I'm of course happy to secure the Super G title. I'm really proud of my season.\" \"I'm relieved that we didn't race today. Conditions were really tough. In my opinion speed events should be canceled before one o'clock.

But legislators stunned observers and perhaps each other this week when Republicans and Democrats proved that they can, indeed, agree on government spending. Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray worked out a budget framework to fund the government into 2015. The House approved the compromise agreement Thursday. The measure now goes to the Senate, where it is expected to pass as early as next week. The White House supports the proposal. It was the first full budget agreement by a divided Congress -- in which different parties control the House and Senate -- since 1986, Ryan boasted in announcing the deal. After years of bruising political fights over spending and the federal borrowing limit, dysfunction reigned supreme in October when the government shut down for 16 days. A short-term spending plan got it going again, but a CNN/ORC International poll found that 71% of Americans thought another shutdown would occur when the money ran out in January. Instead, such repeated budget brinksmanship would be put on hold if Congress passes the Ryan-Murray proposal. While neither side loves the compromise legislation, it appears to be on a path to approval. So, what changed this time? Republican leaders stood up . For two years, the most conservative members of the Republican Party, with the help of outside conservative groups, have been driving the agenda in the GOP-led House. House Speaker John Boehner endured humiliating leadership lapses when he was unable to corral sufficient votes from his majority caucus for legislation and agreements opposed by the tea party wing. The government shutdown in October was apparently the last straw. Led by tea party conservatives, Republicans forced a showdown over their demand to dismantle Obamacare. When Democrats balked, the public blamed the GOP for the dysfunction. Plummeting poll numbers emboldened Boehner and other establishment Republicans to assert their leadership this time by defying conservative opposition to the budget agreement. In particular, Boehner has blamed outside conservative groups that exert influence on Republican politics for pushing GOP legislators into the politically disastrous government shutdown in October. \"The day before the government re-opened, one of these groups stood up and said 'well, we never really thought it would work,'\" he told reporters Thursday before animatedly asking: \"Are you kidding me?\" At the same time, Boehner and other GOP leaders want to keep the political focus on problems with Obamacare, such as the botched launch of the HealthCare.gov website and policy cancellations despite President Barack Obama's promise that people could keep coverage they liked. Rep. Paul Ryan: From Republican VP candidate to fiscal deal maker . In defense of defense . In general, members of Congress hated the untargeted forced spending cuts known as sequestration from a 2011 agreement, albeit for different reasons. Democrats disliked the indiscriminate nature of the dramatic spending reductions, with priorities such as education and social programs targeted equally with other less-valued categories. Republicans, meanwhile, opposed the deep cuts to military spending that top generals said weakened America's defense readiness. The budget deal would eliminate $45 billion worth of sequester cuts set to hit in January, as well as another $18 billion scheduled for 2015. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel praised the agreement Thursday, saying it provided certainty for military planning. \"This agreement does not solve all (Department of Defense) budget problems but it helps address readiness especially in 2014 with putting more money back in training, in particular, and procurement,\" said Hagel, a former Republican senator. \"It also gives us some new certainty, predictability for our planning, for our budgeting over the next two years which is particularly important,\" he added. No one likes Congress . Years of dysfunction have really torpedoed the public's view of Congress. After the October government shutdown, a CNN/ORC International poll showed only 14% of respondents expressed satisfaction with how the government was operating. By comparison, 26% of people were dissatisfied with the government during the Watergate scandal. Congress was under pressure from the public as well as the business community, including the influential Chamber of Commerce, which warned that another manufactured government crisis would harm the economy. Perhaps lawmakers are sick of being the least popular kids in town. Pat Murray emerges as bipartisan figure after budget deal . Democrats don't want to be blamed . Republicans got the most blame for the October shutdown, and Democrats want to make that a permanent association in the mind of the public. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told CNN on Thursday that the anti-government tea party wing had sullied the GOP brand. \"In many ways, those people have hijacked the name Republican, which has been such a valuable contribution to our country, the Republican Party,\" the California Democrat said. \"But they've taken it over the cliff.\" With congressional elections coming up next year, Democrats want to ensure that voters think of Republicans whenever the word shutdown comes up. Agreeing to the budget plan avoids the possibility of another shutdown until at least 2015, preserving the negative connotation for Republicans through the next election cycle. Certainty at last . Actually passing a formal budget for the first time in several years benefits everyone. Congress returns to what leaders call \"regular order\" on the budget, meaning spending proposals are debated and passed instead of the practice in recent years of merely authorizing spending at previous levels. Bureaucrats can develop strategies and plans based on known figures, rather than wallowing in uncertainty over how much money the bickering legislators finally would authorize. Legislators up for re-election next year can campaign on their political and fiscal philosophies and accomplishments -- such as passing a budget -- instead of engaging in spending showdowns that anger voters and hinder economic growth. \"I came here to cut the size of government. That's exactly what this bill does,\" Boehner said Thursday of the budget deal. Meanwhile, Pelosi made sure to point out that passing the budget agreement would require Democratic votes because too many Republicans oppose it for the majority party to push it through on its own. \"They haven't passed anything with their own votes that was any good for the country,\" she said.

UPDATED: . 03:34 EST, 24 November 2012 . The evidence of a psychiatrist accused of distorting reports to suit the needs of local authorities is still being used to remove children from their parents. One mother faced the prospect of having a baby son taken away from her because of a report written by Dr George Hibbert six years ago \u2013 before the child in question was even born. The doctor is at the centre of an investigation over claims that he falsely diagnosed parents with mental disorders to fit with the view of social services. Dr George Hibbert, facing clams he deliberately misdiagnosed patients . He has already offered to surrender his doctor's licence following the claims \u2013 but has been told the allegations are so serious he must face a public hearing. Now the Mail Online has learned that his reports \u2013 for which he has been paid millions by local authorities \u2013 are still being used in the secret family courts against parents he labelled 'unfit'. One woman, who can be named only as Miss C, had her two daughters taken away after she failed one of Dr Hibbert's controversial 'parenting assessments' in 2006. In a bizarre report, he criticised Miss C for speaking to her elder daughter 'in an over-bright tone', vacuuming the floor 'in an agitated way' and even on one occasion, for 'overcooking the pasta'. He also expressed concern that her youngest daughter, who was just two months old, spent too much time 'asleep, wrapped in blankets'. Claims have been made by a woman known as Miss B, about how her daughter, now six, was taken away from her mother due to a report by psychiatrist Dr George Hibbert . He concluded she was 'unable to protect the children from harm' because she was 'preoccupied' by what other people thought of her. As a result of the report, the mother was forced to endure the agony of having her two children taken away \u2013 and placed in the care of her abusive ex-partner. 'I couldn't believe it,' she said. 'They are everything to me. To have them taken away was awful for me but much worse for them. My eldest daughter was utterly traumatised.' Determined to get her daughters back, Miss C fought a long legal battle and eventually won the right to care for her two daughters unsupervised for one day a week. When she gave birth to another baby earlier this year, a parenting assessment found 'no concerns' about Miss C's ability to look after the child, who was 'happy' and 'contented' in her care. But despite this, her local authority started proceedings to have the boy removed and adopted \u2013 citing Dr Hibbert's six-year-old report on her parenting capabilities as evidence she was an unfit mother. 'It was like being in a nightmare' she said. 'Everybody knows I'm a good mother. But Dr Hibbert's report is like a black cloud hanging over everything. It just seems so wrong that they could still have used his reports in court to take my baby away, even though he's being investigated and all these people have come forward.' The General Medical Council is investigating a string of claims by women who say their children were wrongly removed as a result of Dr Hibbert's reports. At least one former member of staff at his Assessment centre \u2013 Tadpole Cottage in Blunsdon, Wiltshire \u2013 is understood to have come forward in support of the parents. Earlier this year, Dr Hibbert, an eminent psychiatrist who has lectured at Oxford and advised MPs on the family courts, offered to surrender his doctor's licence after being confronted with allegations that he had deliberately misdiagnosed patients with mental disorders. But the GMC dismissed his request and has said it expects to hold a Fitness to Practise Hearing early next year. Dr Hibbert is now seeking permission of the High Court to challenge the GMC's decision to investigate one complaint that falls outside the usual five-year time limit for investigations. Meanwhile a number of women have contacted a solicitors' firm in Manchester regarding civil claims against the psychiatrist. In a statement, Dr Hibbert said: 'I have had one complaint referred to the GMC's Fitness to Practise Panel for a hearing, a complaint that relates to a case in 2007, but no hearing date has yet been fixed. 'There are other complaints that the GMC are investigating but their investigations in these other cases are at a preliminary stage and none of them has been referred to the GMC's Fitness to Practise Panel.'

President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared martial law in the southern province of Maguindanao after 57 people were killed in politically motivated violence. Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the Eastern Mindanao command, told CNN on Saturday that searchers have made arrests and recovered firearms and vehicles from a clan implicated in the killings. He said local residents welcome the deployment of the troops. \"We need this because we do not want those who perpetrated the crime to slip out of the province. And we may be having a hard time catching them,\" he said. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said martial law -- under which police can make arrests without a warrant -- went into effect at 9 p.m. Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days. Brawner said the measure was invoked to impose peace on the region after the unrest, which led to troops being mobilized. \"Life is to resume normally and martial law is established to prevent new violence, with troops on the ground monitoring any possible violence breakout,\" he said. \"But the civilian government will be running the affairs of the province, not a military governor.\" Military police have detained three brothers and their father on suspicion of involvement in the unrest: Akmad Ampatuan, the vice governor of Maguindanao; Anwar Ampatuan, the mayor of Sherif Auguak, Maguindanao's capital; and Zaldy Ampatuan, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the patriarch, became ill and was hospitalized after he, too, was taken in. \"Local government will function, it will prevent armed groups from wreaking havoc ... and it will allow the officials search and find the guilty parties,\" Brawner said. Security forces on Friday searched the home of Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay and son of the provincial governor of Maguindanao, according to Brawner. Authorities say Andal Ampatuan Jr. directed the Nov. 23 politically motivated killings. Weapons were found in the house, Brawner said. On Tuesday, Philippine authorities charged Ampatuan and other suspects with 25 counts of murder in the killings. Still more suspects were taken into custody Friday. The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said. The National Bureau of Investigation has moved a third witness to Manila for questioning, the Philippines News Agency reported Thursday. \"At the moment, we are interviewing the witness so that we would know what he knows about the incident in Maguindanao,\" NBI Director Nestor Mantaring said. The witness claimed to have been at the site during the massacre. \"He is very vital,\" Mantaring said. \"From what I know ... he knows a lot of information regarding the incident.\" Among the victims in the massacre were the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael \"Toto\" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan, the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Witnesses and local officials have blamed the younger Ampatuan, a longtime ally of the Philippines president and a known warlord. They said the killings were an attempt to block Mangudadatu from challenging him in the May gubernatorial election. Also killed were a dozen journalists who had accompanied the women. Group: Philippines most dangerous country for journalists . Asked why martial law was imposed 12 days after the killings, Cabangbang said authorities \"were trying to build a case -- a tight case\" against suspects. \"But it is taking long to build a case, so I think the government gave us a free hand in arresting those who are suspects, and allowed us to search, even without warrant. So we really need this declaration of state of martial law.\" Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation. Suspicion fell on Ampatuan after a government construction vehicle was found at the hastily dug mass grave that held the bodies of the massacre victims.

Airplanes and helicopters will begin circling the barrier island beach later this week as federal, state and local search efforts continue, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer told reporters on Wednesday. \"The high-resolution technology should be able to provide a detailed representation of the area and will extend through Nassau County,\" Dormer said. \"We're hoping the technology will help identify skeletal remains that may still be out there.\" The aerial imagery will supplement police-dog search units, which expected to resume searching later this week. Meanwhile, diver teams are already scouring the waterways on the north side of the barrier island. Eight different sets of confirmed human remains have been found in Suffolk County, Long Island, since December, in what police say could be the work of a serial killer or killers. Additional remains -- including a human skull -- were uncovered Monday. Police have not said whether the latest remains are from different people, or if they could have come from the eight victims. Some of the remains found Monday in a Nassau County wildlife preserve were wrapped in a \"black plastic product\" similar to a plastic bag, a law enforcement source said Wednesday. The remains \"appeared to be part of a lower extremity,\" the source said. Medical examiner investigators are trying to determine the age and sex of the remains and attempt to find out how long they were at the location before being discovered. Federal agents first joined police in their investigation in December, after four bodies had been found. That discovery on a quarter-mile stretch of Oak Beach indicates that \"they were dumped there by the same person or persons,\" Dormer told reporters at the time. \"It's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location.\" They were all found stuffed in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property. The grisly find occurred as police searched for 24-year-old Shannan Gilbert, who was last seen alive in May 2010 in the Gilgo Beach area. Gilbert's sisters said Shannan was an escort who was visiting a client. They said she ran from the man's house and called 911, claiming that someone was trying to hurt her. In a strange series of events, a local resident -- who lives a few miles from where the remains were found -- said a young woman who \"looked like she was partying all night\" came to his door at about 5 a.m. on May 1. \"She was screaming 'Help me, help me!' and said somebody was chasing her,\" said Gustav Coletti, who lives in the town of Oak Beach. He described the woman as a \"young, light-brown-haired person in her early 20s.\" Coletti said he called 911 after opening his front door to the woman, prompting her to flee into the weeds along an embankment near his house. Moments later, Coletti said an \"Asian-looking man\" man driving a dark-colored sport utility vehicle pulled up alongside his home, looking for the woman. \"Things got out of hand at a party and I'm just looking for her,\" Coletti quoted the man as saying. When Coletti told the man that he had called police, the man said he \"should not have done that\" and drove toward where girl had fled, Coletti said. But he says it took police more than four months to question him about the incident, potentially losing crucial evidence over that time frame. Coletti later told CNN that he believes the woman he saw that night was Gilbert. CNN can not independently verify that claim. Dormer said Wednesday that he has \"no idea when the detective spoke to whomever you're talking about,\" referencing Coletti. Police said they received a written statement from Coletti in June.

It entered 120 pupils for GCSEs and equivalent exams with all gaining at least five qualifications at grade C or higher. The most improved school in England was St Thomas More Catholic School in north London. Its GCSE results have risen from less than a third (31%) of pupils reaching the target of five or more A*-C grades , including English and maths, in 2010 to more than nine in 10 (91%) achieving this benchmark in 2013 - a 60% improvement. Education Secretary Michael Gove said the results were proof that Coalition reforms were starting to produce great effects. He said improvements had been made despite the imposition of tougher exam targets for schools and a drive to push more pupils onto rigorous academic disciplines that will 'help them find a good job or go on to university'. In all, more than a third of pupils took GCSEs in so-called 'English Baccalaureate' subjects \u2013 English, maths, science, foreign languages and history or geography \u2013 last summer compared with less than a quarter 12 months earlier. But the data also fuelled fears that large numbers of pupils are still consigned to a substandard education. To gain the EBacc, pupils must score at least a C at GCSE in English, maths, science, history or geography and a foreign language. A DfE analysis of the data found that this year, 202,000 pupils were entered for the EBacc, compared with 130,000 in 2012. In 735 secondaries, more than half of pupils were entered for the EBacc, and in 237 secondaries more than 50 per cent of students achieved the EBacc. Rise: More secondary school pupils than ever are taking the English Baccalaureate, figures released today also revealed . Mr Gove said that the figures were 'a credit to the professionalism and hard work of teachers'. 'Thanks to their efforts, the number of children taught in under-performing schools has fallen by almost 250,000 since 2010,' he said. 'This progress has been achieved at the same time as our EBacc has ensured many more young people are taking the core subjects which will most help them find a good job or go on to university.' Simon Burgess, director of the Centre for Market and Public Organisation and professor of economics at University of Bristol said: 'Performance tables are an important part of the school accountability system in England.

Political violence returned to the Thai capital as three anti-government protesters were killed by gunmen, hours before demonstrators hounded the interim Prime Minister from a meeting. \"If the situation turns more violent it could lead to riots,\" Army chief Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha said in a national address. \"The Army will have to use military forces to resolve the situation for peace and order.\" The attack occurred at about 2 a.m. local time Thursday when gunmen on a pickup truck opened fire on a protest camp near the site of Bangkok's Democracy Monument, where protesters have been camped for months, said Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, Thailand's national security adviser to the Prime Minister. Bangkok's Erawan Emergency Center reported that three people were killed in the attack and 23 injured. The fatally injured victims included a 21-year-old man, who was shot in the chest, and a 51-year-old man. Later that morning, anti-government protesters stormed the grounds of an Air Force office compound, forcing the country's caretaker Prime Minister to flee a meeting with members of the Election Commission. Paradon said the protesters drove a truck through a gate to reach the front of an Air Force office complex, while new interim premier Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan and ministers were meeting in another part of the building. As a result of the disruption, the meeting was called off and the politicians left the venue, said Paradon. Air Force spokesman Air Vice Marshal Montol Sanchukorn told CNN that the protesters, who are seeking the government's ouster, then demanded to \"inspect\" the room to check that the Prime Minister was no longer inside. \"We allowed them in to see, and they said they would have a bit of a rest before they left,\" he said. Some protesters remained to stage a sit-in at the complex. Thailand was rocked by rival mass political protests over the weekend, with pro- and anti-government supporters taking to the streets in their tens of thousands following fresh twists in the country's protracted political crisis. Thai turmoil . Caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra was removed from office along with nine cabinet ministers by a top court last Wednesday, and subsequently indicted by the country's anti-graft body. If the country's Senate votes to impeach her, she could be banned from politics for five years. WATCH: Acting Thai PM -- 'Government still in charge' Protesters led by the People's Democratic Reform Committee have been agitating against her government since November, calling for it to be replaced with an unelected interim government. Drawn mainly from Bangkok's royalist, middle class establishment, the anti-government protesters have been seeking to rid Thai politics of the alleged influence of Yingluck's brother, the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin, a telecommunications tycoon, was overthrown in a 2006 military coup and has since lived in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction. His opponents claim he has continued to exert influence in Thai politics through his sister and other allies. The November protests that sparked the current crisis were triggered by the government's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have cleared the way for his return to the political fold. The anti-government protesters are seeking a new government -- but not through elections, which the opposition Democrat Party has boycotted, arguing the alleged corruption of their political rivals makes widespread reform necessary before any meaningful vote can be held. 'Judicial coup'? Meanwhile the government's \"red shirt\" support base, many of whom hail from the country's rural north and northeast, view Shinawatra's ouster as a \"judicial coup\" and have been protesting what they consider an unfair bias by many of the country's institutions against their side. Yingluck, who was elected in a landslide at the polls in 2011, is the third Thaksin-linked prime minister to be dismissed by the Constitutional Court, which also dissolved Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai political party in 2007. Analyst Paul Quaglia, director at PQA Associates, a Bangkok-based risk assessment firm, told CNN last week that Yingluck's supporters saw her dismissal as a case of politically motivated judicial overreach. \"They consider it a way to usurp democratic elections,\" he said, adding that the opposition was unlikely to win at the polls. \"The Democrat Party say 'No, we can't have elections,' because they know they will lose those elections,\" he said.

Comet C/2013 A1, also known as comet Siding Spring, will pass within about 87,000 miles (139,500 kilometers) of the Red Planet on Sunday - less than half the distance between Earth and our moon, and less than one-tenth the distance of any known comet flyby of Earth. Researchers say it will provide an unprecedented opportunity to gather data on both the comet and its effect on the Martian atmosphere. Scroll down for video . An artist's concept of Comet Siding Spring (2013 A1) and Mars. Closest approach to Mars is on October 19, 2014.\u00a0Spacecraft will collect in a 'duck and cover' move to avoid dust from the comet . Nasa's five robotic explorers at Mars - three orbiters and two rovers - are being repurposed to witness a comet named Siding Spring make its first known visit to the inner solar system. So are a European and an Indian spacecraft circling the red planet. The orbiting craft will attempt to observe the incoming iceball, then hide behind Mars for protection from potentially dangerous dusty debris in the comet tail. Shielded by the Martian atmosphere, the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers may well have the best seats in the house, although a dust storm on Mars could obscure the view. 'Think about a comet that started its travel probably at the dawn of man and it's just coming in close now,' said Carey Lisse, a senior astrophysicist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, in a NASA news briefing about Comet Siding Spring last week. 'And the reason we can actually observe it is because we have built satellites and rovers. We've now got outposts around Mars.' Siding Spring's nucleus will come closest to Mars around 11:27 a.m. PDT (2:27 p.m. EDT), hurtling at about 126,000 mph (56 kilometers per second). This proximity will provide an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to gather data on both the comet and its effect on the Martian atmosphere. 'This is a cosmic science gift that could potentially keep on giving, and the agency's diverse science missions will be in full receive mode,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. 'This particular comet has never before entered the inner solar system, so it will provide a fresh source of clues to our solar system's earliest days.'

Nasa's Mars orbiters lining up behind Mars for their 'duck and cover' maneuver to shield them from comet dust that may result from the close flyby of Comet Siding Spring (C/2013 A1) on Oct. 19, 2014. 'We certainly have fingers crossed for the first images of a comet from the surface of another world,' said NASA program scientist Kelly Fast. Spacecraft farther afield, including the Hubble Space Telescope, already are keeping a sharp lookout, as are ground observatories and research balloons. 'We're getting ready for a spectacular set of observations,' said Jim Green, head of NASA's planetary science division. Named for the Australian observatory used to detect it in January 2013, Siding Spring will approach Mars from beneath and zoom right in front Sunday afternoon, Eastern Time. On Earth, the best viewing, via binoculars or telescope, will be from the Southern Hemisphere - South Africa and Australia will be in prime position. In the Northern Hemisphere, it will be difficult to see Siding Spring slide by Mars. The comet - with a nucleus estimated to be at least a half-mile in diameter - hails from the Oort Cloud on the extreme fringe of the solar system. It formed during the first million or two years of the solar system's birth 4.6 billion years ago and, until now, ventured no closer to the sun than perhaps the orbits of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune. It comes around every one or more million years. It will be the first Oort Cloud comet to be studied up close in detail. For comparison, the flyby distance of 87,000 miles is about one-third of the way from here to the moon. Siding Spring's tail could extend from Earth all the way to our moon. Its gaseous coma, the fuzzy head surrounding the nucleus, might stretch halfway to the moon. No comet has come anywhere near this close to Earth in recorded history. 'We can't get to an Oort Cloud comet with our current rockets ... so this comet is coming to us,' said Carey Lisse, senior astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University's applied physics laboratory. By studying Siding Spring's composition and structure, scientists hope to learn more about how the planets formed, according to Lisse. Comet Siding Spring comes from the Oort Cloud, material left over from the formation of the solar system. 'This comet is coming into the solar system straight from the Oort Cloud. It's likely this is its first time this close to the sun,' said space scientist David Humm, of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. Oort Cloud material, including comets, is scattered through a vast region that begins outside the orbits of Neptune and Pluto and extends a substantial fraction of the distance to Proxima Centauri, the closest neighboring star. Oort Cloud comets can tell scientists about the materials - including water and carbon compounds - that existed during the formation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. The images above show -- before and after filtering -- comet C/2013 A1, also known as Siding Spring, as captured by Wide Field Camera 3 on NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Studying this close encounter will be the largest fleet of orbiting scientific observatories ever flown to another world, orbiting around (and rolling on the ground of) Mars. These instruments will, for the first time ever, have the chance to make close-up observations of a comet new to the inner solar system. And though it will not be the easiest task, the teams operating these instruments and spacecraft have developed plans to take advantage of this rare opportunity. Siding Spring is small (the nucleus is less than a mile in diameter) and fast (it will pass Mars at about 34 miles per second). CRISM, HiRISE, and CTX were built to study a slowly-moving planet, so they will use MRO's ability to rotate in order to capture images as the comet speeds by Mars. The instruments will observe the comet repeatedly for two and a half days as it gets closer and closer to Mars before it makes its closest approach. The peak density of comet dust at Mars is expected 98 minutes after closest approach of the nucleus, and the MRO spacecraft will position itself behind the planet at that time. How graphic shows the science observations that may be captured by NASA Mars spacecraft during the close encounter with Comet Siding Spring (C/2013 A1). Scientists also are keen to spot any changes to the comet or Mars due to the close approach. NASA's newly arrived Maven spacecraft, for instance, will compare the upper atmosphere before and after it passes. 'Think about a comet that started its travel probably at the dawn of man and it's just coming in close now,' Lisse said. 'And the reason we can actually observe it is because we have built satellites and rovers. 'We've now got outposts around Mars.' Scientists initially worried the spacecraft orbiting Mars would be at considerable risk from the comet's massive trail of dust. The nucleus itself poses no danger of impact. But the particles in the tail, hurtling through space at 126,000 mph could fry electronics, puncture fuel lines, or destroy computers, transmitters or other vital spacecraft parts. This graphic depicts the orbit of comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring as it swings around the sun in 2014. As Siding Spring's path became clearer, the threat level was deemed minimal. Still, space agencies are taking no chances. They're employing the 'duck and cover' strategy. NASA's three orbiters - Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and newcomer Maven - will be behind the red planet at the time of peak danger. That's a 20-minute-or-so period approximately 1 1/2 hours after the closest approach by the comet's nucleus. The European Space Agency also shifted the orbit of its Mars Express as did India for its Mars Orbiter Mission, or MOM, the country's first interplanetary spacecraft that, like NASA's Maven, arrived last month. The precautions are prudent, said University of Maryland senior research scientist Tony Farnham, who led a hazard-analysis team. 'Comets are complex beasts and don't always live up to our predictions,' Farnham said in an email Wednesday. 'If you don't want surprises, then don't study comets.' It will take at least a few days to obtain and analyze the best spacecraft data; but images made from Earth should be forthcoming pretty quickly. Siding Spring should pass closest to the sun six days after its Mars flyby, then swing back out, bidding goodbye, for at least another million years. NASA's Mars orbiters will gather information before, during and after the flyby about the size, rotation and activity of the comet's nucleus, the variability and gas composition of the coma around the nucleus, and the size and distribution of dust particles in the comet's tail. On Oct. 19, the comet will have a very close pass at Mars, just 82,000 miles (132,000 kilometers) from the planet. Observations of the Martian atmosphere are designed to check for possible meteor trails, changes in distribution of neutral and charged particles, and effects of the comet on air temperature and clouds. MAVEN will have a particularly good opportunity to study the comet, and how its tenuous atmosphere, or coma, interacts with Mars' upper atmosphere. Earth-based and space telescopes, including NASA's iconic Hubble Space Telescope, also will be in position to observe the unique celestial object. The agency's astrophysics space observatories -- Kepler, Swift, Spitzer, Chandra -- and the ground-based Infrared Telescope Facility on Mauna Kea, Hawaii -- also will be tracking the event."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Comet Siding Spring, from the Oort Cloud, will closely pass Mars, offering a unique opportunity to study its composition.

Mr. Brennan has said he regrets these practices. Yet he moved from the CIA to the White House, where he began to support a practice many consider worse than torture: targeted killing. Brennan has been a champion and defender of attacks by C.I.A. drones that have killed thousands of people, including hundreds of children, far from any battlefield. These killings have occurred in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has recently said the killing is likely to expand to Libya, Mali and Nigeria. Panetta, Brennan and others in the Obama administration defended these lawless killings the same way the Bush administration justified the unlawful treatment of detainees. Officials in both administrations have sought to win public support and overcome opposition by repeatedly asserting that what they are doing is effective and lawful. The tactical parallels are striking. To create an illusion of legality, both administrations coined new labels for unlawful practices. President Bush's people coined the term \"enhanced interrogation methods\" to describe torture, and are still asserting that waterboarding is not torture but an effective, necessary tool to keep the country safe. Brennan unveiled the phrase \"hot battlefield\" in a speech at Harvard Law in September 2011. A \"hot battlefield\" is the type found in traditional armed conflicts, where enemy fighters are killed without warning and it is permissible to also kill civilians, as long as their deaths are unintentional collateral damage and not disproportionate to the military objective. The CIA is killing civilians away from \"hot battlefields,\" but according to Brennan, there are other types of battlefields that are not \"hot\" but nevertheless lawful places to intentionally kill targets and unintentionally those nearby. Opinion: Chuck Hagel is a friend to Israel . The parallels between the two administrations do not end with fabricated terminology. Lawyers in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in both administrations have written secret memos apparently analyzing the legality of these troubling practices. After the memos were written, waterboarding continued during the Bush administration. President Obama finally ended it with an executive order signed within days of his first inauguration. Guantanamo, however, stayed open, and targeted killing continued. We can safely assume that the memos conclude the United States may lawfully carry out such practices. It is surprising to me that anyone feels the need to actually see these secret memos. International law clearly makes waterboarding, secret detention and targeted killing away from battlefields unlawful. The fact these practices have continued after the writing of the memos demonstrates the analysis is window dressing. The New York Times and the American Civil Liberties Union, among others, have committed significant resources to obtaining the memos on targeted killing. It would, of course, be interesting to compare the specious arguments and omissions that must characterize these memos with those released by the Bush administration on interrogation and detention. Some citizens might actually need to see the memos to finally demand an end to the practice. The greater importance of the secret memos does not concern what they contain, but the fact our democratic government believes legal analysis can be secret -- that how the government understands the law that regulates its conduct need not be made public. The judge in a recent case who ruled the memos might lawfully remain secret has confused the facts of a particular case with the law. Facts about particular operations can be kept secret, but not the law on which such operations are based. If the police seek a warrant, for example, in some cases the identity of a particular person sought under the warrant may be kept confidential. The law mandating the need for the warrant is public. Game playing with the law does not amount to effective counter-terrorism strategy. Brennan admitted as much in his Harvard speech: . \"I've developed a profound appreciation for the role that our values, especially the rule of law, play in keeping our country safe,\" he said. \"It's an appreciation, of course, understood by President Obama. ... That is what I want to talk about this evening: how we have strengthened, and continue to strengthen, our national security by adhering to our values and our laws.\" The CIA needs someone who will do what Brennan says, not what he does. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Ellen O'Connell."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "John Brennan, a defender of C.I.A. drone attacks, introduced the term 'hot battlefield' in a Harvard speech to justify the killings.

You're okay, buddy,\" and the sound of a machine clearing the toddler's airway. Spencer Morrey, pictured with his father Craig, has severe cerebral palsy and requires 24-hour medical care. Both sounds come every few minutes, in between hugs, tears and kisses. Spencer has severe cerebral palsy and requires constant, 24-hour medical care. In Japan, a country that lacks sufficient medical services for disabled children, the only person to care for Spencer is his father. Morrey says his wife left, overwhelmed by the strain of their son's medical condition. That would be pain beyond what most parents could imagine. But Spencer's mother fled while pregnant with Morrey's daughter, Amelia. In more than a year, Morrey says he has only seen his daughter four times. \"She wouldn't recognize me,\" Morrey said, with Spencer propped on his lap. \"She wouldn't call me daddy. She's just starting to talk now. But she's not going to know who I am. I think she deserves my love. And I think she deserves to be with Spencer and Spencer deserves to be with her.\" Morrey, a native of Chicago and a U.S. citizen, was married to a Brazilian woman of Japanese descent. They divorced in a Japanese court. Under Brazilian law, Morrey would likely have joint custody and guardianship of both children. What do you think about Spencer's case? Have your say . But in Japan, where only one parent gets custody of a child in a divorce, the family courts have left the case in legal limbo for a year because they have not decided which parent legally has custody of the children. Typically, the parent with physical custody of a child retains custody. Morrey has stayed in Japan the last year, trying to get the courts to recognize that he has joint custody of the children in Brazil (he has not yet applied for such custody under U.S. law).  Watch Kyung Lah's report on the case \u00bb . He is afraid that if he heads home for the U.S. with Spencer without that, he could be subject to international child abduction laws, and he also fears such a move could hurt his chances of getting the Japanese family court to give him joint custody of his daughter. Morrey has been forced to quit work to care for Spencer. The financial strain of living off his credit cards is adding to the stress of caring for a disabled child alone in a foreign country. Despite his pleading with court mediators and repeated court filings claiming that joint custody is the law in both the U.S. and Brazil, Japan's slow and antiquated family courts have let the case languish. \"Kids need both parents,\" Morrey said. \"Whether the parents are married or not is irrelevant in my mind. The Japanese courts, and I realize you're going against years and years of cultural differences and everything else, but they don't care about the welfare of the child. \"In Japan, it's considered too messy. It's too complicated. It deals with personal feelings, so they don't want to deal with it. So the best way is to not deal with it.\" CNN contacted Morrey's ex-wife four times by telephone and once by fax. She declined to discuss the case. The International Association for Parent and Child Reunion believes there are an estimated 100 American families in situations like Morrey's in Japan and dozens involving those from Britain, France and Canada. One of those cases is that of American Christopher Savoie. Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, was arrested on September 28 in Yanagawa, Japan, for attempting to abduct his two children, eight-year-old Isaac and six-year-old Rebecca.  Watch more about this case \u00bb . Savoie drove his children to the nearest U.S. consulate in the city of Fukuoka to try and obtain passports for them. Steps away from the front of the consulate, Japanese police arrested him. Savoie is now in jail, awaiting a decision by prosecutors on a possible indictment. Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before their bitter divorce in January. According to court documents, she fled with the children to Japan in the summer. A U.S. court then gave Christopher Savoie sole custody of the children. But Japanese law recognizes Noriko Savoie as the sole custodian, despite the U.S. order. \"It's like a black hole,\" Morrey said. \"If you go through a divorce, there's this joke. If you have an international marriage with a Japanese, don't piss them off because you'll never see your kids again.\" Not seeing his daughter Amelia again is what is keeping Morrey in Japan. He has been selling off everything he owns, trying to keep himself and Spencer afloat, hoping the Japanese court will bring him some legal connection to his child. He is stuck choosing between caring for his son, who needs the better resources of the U.S., and hoping to be a father to his daughter. \"How do you make that choice? It's not -- once you're a dad, you're always a dad.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "U.S. citizen Craig Morrey, living in Japan, cares for his son, Spencer, with severe cerebral palsy.

But Caroline Jamieson got much more than she expected when her husband ended up in jail and afraid he would be deported. Jamieson, vice president of marketing at a new-media advertising company, wrote President Barack Obama in January because her husband, Herv\u00e9 Fonkou Takoulo, was facing deportation to his native Cameroon. Takoulo failed in a bid before political asylum almost a decade ago, and a judge issued a deportation order after they were married. After he and Jamieson married on 2005, Takoulo applied for a green card based on his marriage to a U.S. citizen. But immigration law requires that the deportation order be lifted before the couple can appear before immigration officials to argue their case that the marriage is legitimate and not a ploy to legalize Takoulo's presence in the United States. \"We want to be given the chance to interview and prove that we are a married couple, so Herv\u00e9 can get a green card, and that has proven extremely difficult to do,\" Jamieson told CNN. They never received a direct response to the letter. But they did get two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers waiting outside their East Village, Manhattan apartment on June 3 when Takoulo was leaving the apartment to go to the gym. Jamieson told CNN that the officers cornered her husband and asked him if he had written a letter to the president. \"He said 'No, but my wife did.' And they explained that with that letter -- when it was brought to their attention -- that the Obama administration wanted them to resolve this quickly,'\" Jamieson said. Her husband was held at ICE headquarters for six hours, alone in a room, until he was chained at the wrists, around his stomach and his ankles and taken to the Hudson County Correctional Center in New Jersey, she said. For the next two weeks, a frantic Jamieson wrote letters to politicians and anyone else who might be able to help. She got responses, she said, but none seemed to lead anywhere. Takoulo was allowed to call his wife once a day at designated times but he knew little about his situation. He spent his days with repeat sex offenders and men accused of felonies, fearing imminent deportation. \"I did everything I could and went into survival mode and pushed for all these connections to the press,\" she said. \"We are fortunate to have that leverage. What about the people in the country who don't have access to those means?\" Then, on Thursday, he was brought to an immigration processing jail in Manhattan and released. There was no explanation offered for his release, but Takoulo is now wearing an electronic ankle monitor while his case is being reviewed. ICE spokesman Brian P. Hale said the circumstances of Takoulo's arrest were undergoing an internal review and he was released as \"an alternative to detention pending a review of his case.\" Investigators are looking to determine whether \"appropriate separation\" between Jamieson's letter to the president and Takoulo's deportation case were violated. If so, he said, the case will go to the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility and the Homeland Security Department's inspector general for \"immediate and appropriate action.\" Takoulo graduated from the State University of New York at Stony Brook with an engineering degree in 2008 and received several job interview offers after graduation. But the deportation order hung over his head and prevented any followup. \"All he wants to do is contribute to this economy,\" Jamieson told CNN. \"We want to be a productive couple.

On Tuesday, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) circulated a list of the missing artworks, which art dealer Ramon Cernuda examined and said would likely be valued at close to $1.5 million. Cernuda first alerted law enforcement officials to the theft in February after buying a painting by a 20th-century Cuban artist for $15,000. After researching the painting, Cernuda said he discovered the work was registered to Havana's National Museum of Fine Arts. He said he contacted officials there who, upon searching their archives, confirmed the painting and others were missing. While no major works were stolen, Cernuda said the case was notable because art theft is relatively rare in Cuba. Museums are tightly guarded and artwork is usually inspected before it leaves the country. \"The theft is so much more complicated than the smuggling out of Cuba,\" Cernuda said. \"To just get the art out of the museum is very complicated.\" Cuban authorities have not said whether any arrests have been made, but a statement issued by the Cuban National Council of Cultural Heritage said an investigation showed the artworks were removed from their frames while in storage. Cernuda said the same dealer in Miami who sold him the painting he purchased had another 10 Cuban artworks for sale that appeared to have been crudely cut from their frames. \"It's an obvious tell that something is going on,\" he said. Cernuda said he has turned over the painting he purchased to the FBI, and he said the agency is investigating.

But we had no choice. Two months after starting \u2018big school\u2019 last year our lovely boy, Jack, our previously care-free fourth child, had made an attempt to cut his arm with a large chopping knife. Jack had skipped off to secondary school full of excitement. When your child breaks a leg it\u2019s a blue light into A&E. But when you arrive at a GP surgery to seek help on mental problems, the first response was to tell our child to pull himself together (file picture) But within weeks he had descended into a mental health freefall \u2014 consumed with worry about being late to school and struggling with his homework, he became severely withdrawn and paranoid. He wasn\u2019t sleeping, and his anxiety was making him physically unwell. My husband and I were not remotely prepared for it. Three months after he tried to cut himself \u2014 and by now nearly halfway through his school year \u2014 Jack was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), which means you feel anxious about almost everything. Sufferers also start catastrophising, imagining the worst possible outcome for everything that is bothering them. Indeed for Jack, every problem would morph into something far bigger. Our son is now well on his way to a complete recovery, thanks to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). But accessing the specialist help he needed was unbelievably difficult, and if I hadn\u2019t kept battling his corner, there is no doubt in my mind that by now he would be in hospital. When your child breaks a leg it\u2019s a blue light into A&E. When their asthma gets worse, the doctor will write you a new inhaler prescription. But when you arrive at a GP surgery to seek help on mental problems, the first response \u2014 at least in our case \u2014 was to tell our child to pull himself together. So a crushing report published last month by the Commons Health Select Committee made painfully familiar reading. It is estimated that one in ten children aged five to 16 suffers from a diagnosable mental health disorder \u2014 including GAD \u2014which equates to three children per class. That\u2019s 290,000 children in Britain. The report concluded there were \u2018serious and deeply ingrained problems\u2019 with mental health services for these young people. You\u2019re telling me. At first, I approached the school, two weeks into Jack\u2019s first term. Doctors often feel woefully unprepared when faced with children in mental health crisis, according to the report from the Commons Health Select Committee . I explained he seemed disproportionately stressed. But responses from staff were feeble: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s Year Seven, they all feel a bit like this\u2019 and \u2018We have children here with real problems, just give him time, he\u2019ll settle\u2019. Although Jack was able to keep it together at school, every day he would come home crying and all the problems would tumble out. \u2018I don\u2019t like that school, I don\u2019t like my tutor, I\u2019ve no one to sit with at break,\u2019 the list was endless. As the weeks went by, he started having trouble sleeping. He would regularly still be awake into the early hours, crying and screaming that he hated life. He began to sleepwalk and lost weight. It was a frightening time for all of us. I felt wretched. Every waking minute of every day my thoughts were centred on Jack. After two months, I took him to see the GP. I couldn\u2019t get an appointment with my usual doctor, so we saw another GP in the practice. She didn\u2019t know our family at all, and had no way of gauging if this behaviour was usual for us. Indeed, doctors often feel woefully unprepared when faced with children in mental health crisis, according to the new report. In a poignant comment, GP Jane Roberts, who is the Royal College of General Practitioners\u2019 clinical champion for youth mental health issues, told the Commons Health Select Committee: \u2018In a ten-minute consultation it can feel overwhelming to open a Pandora\u2019s box and begin to look at what is troubling a young person . . . especially if the options for referral are limited and difficult to access.\u2019 The report\u2019s authors want GPs to receive better training in young people\u2019s mental health, saying everyone has a right to see a professional with sufficient knowledge. Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says it has been campaigning to include mandatory placements in mental health care in GP training. The GP we saw initially advised us to give Jack a few more weeks to see if school became more familiar. But a week later Jack came home with his older brother, who announced he couldn\u2019t cope any more with his sibling\u2019s increasingly erratic behaviour to and from school. He said Jack was constantly checking his bag, checking the time and, on occasions, would try to go back to school at the end of the day to check his homework with the teachers. It's estimated 290,000 children aged five to 16 suffers from a diagnosable mental health disorder . It was as he was telling me this that Jack took a large kitchen knife to his arm. It was a half-hearted attempt and thankfully he didn\u2019t actually pierce the skin. My \u2018lioness protecting her cubs\u2019 instinct kicked in. Through his tears \u2014 and mine \u2014 I calmly told him to put down the knife and hugged him, saying whatever I could think of to comfort him. You will do anything to protect your child, but I knew I was woefully out of my depth. As much as I was saying we would help him, I knew \u2018the system\u2019 was failing us. That same day, I went to the GP surgery and asked for an appointment then and there. But it was the end of surgery hours and it was only when I quietly refused to leave they agreed to see us. We saw yet another GP, who leaned forward and told Jack all about the patients she had seen that day, who were perhaps more in need of help than him. I told her calmly that our son had dallied with knives and told his brother he wanted to die. The GP \u2014 barely out of med-school \u2014 stayed completely expressionless, not so much as a raised eyebrow. I asked for a referral to child and adolescent mental health services and at first she suggested we wait and see and come back in the New Year \u2014 some four weeks later \u2014 if need be. With tears of frustration now rolling down my cheeks, I again indicated my willingness to camp in the surgery until the referral letter was written. She begrudgingly agreed, though our son still wasn\u2019t seen \u2014 even as an emergency referral \u2014 until January. The psychiatrist we saw was sympathetic but made a shocking suggestion. If we could afford it we should pay privately for CBT \u2014 Jack could wait to get it on the NHS, but that could take as long as three months. She could see he needed help urgently, but said there was nothing she could do. Chris Leaman, policy manager at the charity YoungMinds, is not surprised by our story. He says last year 77 per cent of clinical commissioning groups, (the bodies responsible in NHS England for commissioning, planning, agreeing and monitoring health services) had their budgets cut or frozen for such services. In emergency cases, children can end up in police cells as there are no NHS beds available. We are lucky. We have private medical insurance. But still it was a battle \u2014 at every stage I had to keep chasing, and it wasn\u2019t until March we had our first appointment with the psychologist who would finally help our son. Jack found it hard \u2014 CBT works on changing your thought processes, which is not easy \u2014 but he is now well on the road to recovery. He found it difficult returning to school this September but his psychologist helped him with strategies so he could cope. We\u2019ve been warned by Jack\u2019s therapist that he may always be someone who doesn\u2019t react well to big change. But how wrong it is that the help he badly needed was not there for him. Please, health provider decision makers, wake up and make child and adolescent mental health issues a bigger priority. Just last week it was revealed seven mental health patients have killed themselves since 2012 while waiting for a bed on a specialist ward. What more will it take before mental healthcare is taken seriously? It has to be, for all our sakes \u2014 but most of all for those young people who need it.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Give a summary of the following article:\n\nNew York (CNN) -- The serendipitous occurrence of this year's Thanksgiving holiday on the same evening as the Muslim Eid-ul-Adha is a festive occasion to reflect on the place of Islam in American collective consciousness and on Muslims as Americans. On the same evening that millions of Americans gather around their Thanksgiving dinner to celebrate this most American of holidays, even more millions of Muslims around the globe, including the growing number of American Muslims, will do the same -- celebrating as well one of the most definitive moments of their faith -- Prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son for his God. This holiday celebration comes soon after the tragic incident at Fort Hood, when the atrocious act of a mass murderer put Islam and Muslims under some pressure to either denounce or defend their faith. The psychotic act of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, MD, a Muslim American military psychiatrist at Fort Hood who went on a rampage killing 13 U.S. soldiers and wounding 30 others, has prompted two diametrically opposed reactions. On one side are people who say that Islam -- and Islam alone -- is inherently violent and by extension Muslims are constitutionally driven to murder, while on the other are apologetic Muslims who argue their faith is peaceful and benevolent -- unrelated to criminal acts such as Hasan's. The fact is that Maj. Hasan and Osama bin Laden have as much claim on Islam as do Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Persian poet Mawlana Jalal al-Din Rumi, who is the best-selling poet in America. Islam is an abstraction and any Muslim, saintly or satanic, detested or beloved, can and does have a claim on it -- and Islam is not the only world religion with this proclivity for good and evil. The distinguished New York Times columnist David Brooks, one of the most consistently militant warriors in his take on American involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq, takes Islam -- and Islam alone -- to task for having a diabolic roughness on its fringes. But even if so, Islam is not alone in this failure to curtail murderous instincts. The same Hinduism that produced Mahatma Gandhi and his non-violent theory of civil disobedience has also produced Hindu fundamentalists who sliced and skewered pregnant Muslim women alive in Gujarat. The same Christianity that produced Saint Francis of Assisi and Mother Theresa also produced children's crusades and Spanish conquistadors who burned native Americans alive 13 at a time (according to the 16th-century Spanish Dominican priest, Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas) in honor of the Twelve Apostles and Jesus Christ. It also produced American Seung-Hui Cho who killed 32 students and himself at Virginia Tech and American John Wayne Gacy, Jr., who raped and murdered 33 young men and boys in Chicago, Illinois, in the 1970s. The same Judaism that produced Martin Buber, Emanuel Levinas, or Primo Levi also produced the Stern Gang, Meir Kahane and Baruch Goldstein. But the knee jerk reaction of blaming Islam and Muslims, in general, or looking for delusional links to \"al Qaeda,\" for the horrific murders at Fort Hood points to something far more fundamental, overdue, and urgent -- namely something of a psychological barrier for Americans to accept the Islamic component of their own society, culture, and history. To avoid singling out Islam as diabolical, it is imperative for Americans to come to terms with the collectively repressed fact that by far the most important social uprising of their 20th century -- namely the civil rights movement of the 1960s -- is not as exclusively a Christian phenomenon as it is made out to be: The towering figure of a Muslim revolutionary named Malcolm X is of great importance in the history of that movement. It took a whole generation of Americans to accept the fact that Jewish civil rights activists were instrumental in many measures of the success that was achieved in the 1960s. It is long overdue for Americans also to recognize that Malcolm X was equally, if not more, important to the civil rights movement. The way the history of the civil rights movement is mostly remembered now, an overwhelming role is assigned to the Southern Baptist genealogy of Martin Luther King Jr. Malcolm X is delegated to a radical fringe -- portrayed as more of a menace and a hindrance than a positive force in the civil rights movement. But without the simultaneous presence of Malcolm X as a Muslim revolutionary, the Southern Baptist pacifism of Martin Luther King Jr. would not have been as formidable a force. Malcolm X and Martin Luther King were the yin and yang of the civil rights movement -- ennobling anger and vision coming together in hopes of realizing the dream of equality. For more than three decades now, I have taught generations of American students who come to college having scarce read a word about Malcolm X, and yet everything about Martin Luther King Jr. Until Americans come to terms with the fact that they are deeply indebted to a Muslim revolutionary for the fruits of the civil rights movement they enjoy today, Islam and Muslims will continue to be seen as archetypically alien and an everlasting danger to American lives and liberties. Americans are Christians, Jews, Hindus, agnostics, atheists, and anything else in between -- but Americans are also Muslims, millions of them, and Islam has now become integral to what the distinguished American sociologist Robert Bellah termed our \"civil religion.\" It is only apt that this particular Thanksgiving, Americans think about Eid-ul-Adha, as precious to Muslim-Americans as the occasion that has gathered us all \"at the table.\" Let's make room for Muslims \"at the table\" because -- to quote Langston Hughes -- they \"too, sing America.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanksgiving and Eid-ul-Adha's convergence prompts reflection on Islam in America, especially after Maj.

They were involved in drug- and weapons-smuggling from Lebanon, where they moved those and more benign products from the more robust economy next door into the closed Syrian society. The name Shabiha is thought to be taken from the Arabic word for \"ghost.\" Photos: In Syria, families flee and rebels fight . One Syrian writer, Yassin al-Haj Shalih, says it refers to people operating \"outside the law and living in the shadows.\" He and others also think it might be taken from \"shabah,\" the name of a Mercedes model that Shabiha members drove. After the uprising started last year, the Shabiha were enlisted as regime fighters, and the meaning of the term is widely regarded as \"thug.\" The name fits, said Michael Weiss, a Syria expert at the UK-based Henry Jackson Society. They used to smuggle drugs and weapons, Weiss said, but \"now they are being used as butchers.\" Weiss said the government has been blaming the violence across Syria on anti-regime forces. But he said the Shabiha, in fact, \"are the armed gangs\" terrorizing the populace. Sometimes Shabiha wear fatigue pants and T-shirts and have been seen on army tanks. They drive around in white pickups brandishing weapons, Weiss said, and they look like \"muscleheads with bulging physiques.\" Many have shaved heads and sport thick black beards. Syria: How a year of horror unfolded . The beards are a confusing touch, Weiss said, because they \"want to look like Salafists\" so people will think they are the fundamentalist Sunnis they dislike and blame for violence. Shabiha have broken up demonstrations and harassed diplomats, said Andrew Tabler, Syria expert for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He also said people have come under international sanctions for directing Shabiha activities. Opinion: The only glimmer of hope for Syria . Calling them the \"black market\" version of the Syrian security forces, Weiss said they spy for the regime and keep weapons away from resistance fighters by purchasing as many as they can on the black market. Weiss said they also plunder property, gang rape and engage in summary executions. \"Houla was the global recognition of what they'd been up to,\" he said. The regime uses Shabiha for \"plausible deniability,\" Weiss said. For example, the government can say the military wasn't involved in house-to-house raids actually conducted by Syrian security forces. Massacre in Syrian town feels eerily familiar . Analysts say the Shabiha also operate in other parts of the country, such as Deir Ezzor in the east. Weiss said there are reports of other pro-government proxies, such as Kurdish militants, Shiite militants from Lebanon and Iraq, and Iranian forces. The Alawite region is largely along the coast, with Latakia at its center. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies and associate professor of Middle Eastern studies at the University of Oklahoma, said Alawites live \"cheek by jowl\" near Sunnis in Homs, Hama and Idlib province in the west. He describes that as a \"poor band of countryside\" that's the \"center of the revolution.\" \"Not good fences,\" he said. In a recent essay, Landis wrote that \"since the start of the uprising, many Syrian tribesmen have supported the state's security apparatus, controlled by the Assad family. This is not a new practice, and Syrian tribes have been used as enforcers for the Syrian government for decades. In many restive regions of Syria, tribesmen are deployed by the Syrian military as paramilitary forces called Shabiha.\" He wrote they have also been referred to as \"jahaaz, which means 'apparatus,' as in a security apparatus, but has the connotation of 'political tools.'\" Landis notes that in the 1970s, the \"feared\" Shabiha also played an important role in providing Syrians' goods, from mayonnaise to toothpaste. \"They became this super-regime dedicated element, whose livelihood and future were dependent on the regime,\" Landis said. When the troubles started, the regime turned to its indigenous muscle for help, mobilized their networks and \"turned them into special forces and shock troops.\" \"This was necessary because the multi-ethnic army became undependable,\" Landis said of the huge army with a strong Sunni presence. \"They are defecting and don't want to shoot. They won't shoot at other Sunnis.\" Russia, China call for non-intervention . As a result, the regime cycled in \"tons of shabiha who are going to do the heavy lifting,\" and tit-for-tat sectarian blood vendettas have unfolded. He said the recent massacres indicate that the Shabiha are gaining power and influence while the regime is \"flailing around\" and \"losing control of the Syrian army.\" \"Irregular or special forces are increasingly calling the shots,\" he said. Landis likened the situation to Iraq, where minority Sunnis who prevailed during the Saddam Hussein regime lost their clout after a populace dominated by Shiites and Kurds took power. Some Shabiha might hail from other communities, such as the Sunni or Christian. But the mostly Alawite membership join up for money and because they believe they will be persecuted by a Sunni-dominated opposition if al-Assad's regime is toppled, analysts say. The Alawites, who dominate state ministries and have more jobs than other ethnic groups, are clinging to the top and know they will face a \"bleak future.\" \"All the incentives are to back the regime. They got their backs against the wall. There's going to be hell to pay when they lose power,\" Landis said. For now, White said, the resistance has learned to spot the pro-regime fighters. The Free Syrian Army opposition fighters have been attacking the Shabiha and getting their weapons. \"It looks like the FSA has a lot more guns,\" he said. \"I'm not seeing a lot of reports of them running low.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Shabiha, linked to President Bashar al-Assad, are key in suppressing the Syrian uprising.

The 67 doctors were identified in an investigation by NHS watchdog the Care Quality Commission as having illegally signed blank abortion forms, which should be filled in only once they have a thorough understanding of a woman's circumstances. One of the doctors had signed so many blank forms that they were still being used by the abortion clinic four years after he left. All 67 were referred to the General Medical Council but a Freedom of Information request has now established that none of them will be brought before a fitness to practise hearing, where they could be disciplined, suspended, or struck off. The GMC has also refused to pass the names to the police, even though the offence can merit a jail sentence. MPs say the figures are evidence of a society where 'abortion is on demand' and have accused watchdogs of covering up the crimes of doctors who remain free to practise. By law, a woman can have an abortion only if two doctors sign a form having agreed that continuing the pregnancy could cause her physical or emotional harm. The Government advises that at least one doctor has seen the woman \u2013 and at the very least, they should have thoroughly read her medical notes or spoken to her on the phone. But the CQC found that at least 67 doctors working at private and NHS clinics had pre-signed abortion forms without even knowing the names of the women they would be used for. Jim Dobbin, Labour MP for Heywood and Middleton, said: 'This is clear evidence of the abortion-on-demand culture throughout the medical establishment. 'Sixty-seven doctors happily referred for abortions without knowing a single thing about the woman requesting them. Worse, at the very top, senior doctors and lawyers at the GMC decided to keep these crimes to themselves. This shames the GMC and makes a mockery of the Abortion Act.' David Burrowes, the Tory MP for Enfield Southgate and parliamentary chairman of the Conservative Christian Fellowship, said: 'There is something frightening about this. By law, a woman can have an abortion only if two doctors sign a form having agreed that continuing the pregnancy could cause her physical or emotional harm (stock picture) Abortions can legally be performed under certain conditions. The first is that continuing with the pregnancy involves a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman, or her existing children, than having a termination. The woman's 'actual or reasonably foreseeable future environment' may be taken into account. A non-emergency abortion must be agreed by two doctors\u00a0 \u2013 or one in an emergency \u2013 and carried out by a doctor in a\u00a0 Government-approved hospital or clinic. The two doctors who give their consent must work for either an NHS clinic or GP\u00a0 surgery, or at a private provider affiliated to the Health Service, such as Marie Stopes or BPAS,\u00a0 the British Pregnancy Advisory Service. Staff also have a duty to provide impartial and objective counselling. In September 2011, MPs rejected an attempt by Tory MP Nadine Dorries to stop abortion providers giving NHS-funded counselling to women. 'It says something about how sinister and unaccountable abortion practice in the UK has become that such a large number of doctors could brazenly break the law and the most senior medical establishment in the land omit to refer their crimes to the police.' The CQC carried out spot checks on 250 private and NHS abortion clinics in 2012 after it emerged that some doctors had been letting women terminate their pregnancies simply because the foetus was the 'wrong' sex. An undercover investigation for the Daily Telegraph filmed consultant Prabha Sivaraman, who worked for both private clinics and NHS hospitals in Manchester, telling a woman: 'I don't ask questions. If you want a termination, you want a termination.' Dr Raj Mohan, who worked at the private Calthorpe Clinic in Edgbaston, Birmingham, was also filmed agreeing to conduct the procedure even though he told the woman: 'It's like female infanticide, isn't it?' Both doctors are being investigated by the GMC, although they will not face criminal charges because the Crown Prosecution Service said it would not be in the public interest. The CQC said that during the course of its investigations its inspectors had found piles of pre-signed forms at some clinics. One was still using forms signed by a doctor who had left four years before. The Daily Mail used Freedom of Information requests to obtain figures from the GMC on the numbers of doctors referred to them for pre-signing forms following the CQC investigation. But the GMC refused to reveal the names of any of the doctors or give details about their exact job titles or where they practise. Professor Jack Scarisbrick, chairman of Life, the pro-life pregnancy counselling charity, said: 'I think it is utterly disgraceful that the GMC hasn't pursued these doctors. 'How can anyone say that they are acting in \u201cgood faith\u201d when they sign, in advance, forms authorising a serious medical intervention?' Lord Campbell-Savours, a Labour peer, said: 'Whatever one's position on abortion, for or against, we can all agree on one simple principle: The law passed by Parliament should be enforced.'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "67 doctors violated the Abortion Act by illegally pre-signing abortion forms, revealed by an NHS watchdog investigation, CQC spot checks, and Freedom of Information requests.

Rebels have seized several cities from government control and the army has fiercely fought to reclaim some of them. Death toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000. Thousands more have fled the country, prompting a human rights group to once again urge both sides to allow humanitarian aid in. \"Both the Libyan government and opposition forces need to allow unhindered access for aid organizations to assist civilians,\" Bill Frelick, refugee program director at Human Rights Watch said Tuesday. \"People living in areas of heavy fighting in western Libya are now in dire need of medical aid and other assistance.\" Late Monday night, the Gulf Cooperation Council said Libya had rejected its offer of humanitarian aid. The council is comprised of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Meanwhile, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi took aim at the rebel-controlled town of Ras Lanuf, launching aerial strikes Monday to crush the uprising against him. Gadhafi's aerial forces targeted the main road heading into the oil town after launching another air strike earlier, five kilometers (3.1 miles) southeast of the city. The opposition fired anti-aircraft guns in response. The protests against Gadhafi began February 15 as anti-government demonstrators sought the ouster of the 68-year-old Gadhafi who has ruled for nearly 42 years of rule. It started as the kind of revolution that swept neighboring Tunisia and Egypt, but since then the uprising has turned into warfare. And as reports continue to emerge of the government's use of force against civilians, the international community has been left pondering strategies on how to end the violence. Three members of the U.N. Security Council -- France, Britain, and the United States -- were working Monday on a possible resolution that would include language on a no-fly zone over Libya, diplomatic sources at the United Nations said. And the Gulf Cooperation Council said Monday night they supported such an action. But any kind of military intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China, two permanent members of the council that wield veto power. U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he had a \"very clear message to those who are around Col. Gadhafi.\" \"It is their choice to make how they operate moving forward and they will be held accountable for whatever violence continues to take place there,\" he said. NATO said it has begun around-the-clock surveillance flights of Libya. \"We've got NATO as we speak consulting in Brussels around a wide range of potential options, including potential military options,\" Obama added. With no clear end to the deadly clashes in sight, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli. The fierce fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya, with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave. About 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt, the U.N. refugee agency has said. But between 15,000 and 17,000 people are still at a refugee camp near the Libya-Tunisia border. Of those left, the majority are from Bangladesh, the U.N. refugee agency said. The group plans to start running chartered flights to there Tuesday. A man who said he was trapped in Misrata, a city east of Tripoli that has seen heavy clashes, said the rebels were running out of weapons -- but will continue to fight. \"Maybe tomorrow I'll still be alive, i don't know. I have nothing to lose,\" the man said. \"Nobody believes he will be alive tomorrow. Nobody knows.

The participants were paired off and researchers designated one of the pair as a \u2018proposer\u2019, who was given $10 to split with their partner. If their partner accepted the offer the money would be split accordingly, but if it was rejected then both the participants had to walk away from the failed deal empty handed.

The results, published in the journal Psychological Science, showed how on the whole the participants were more likely to accept an offer from a white proposer than a black proposer.

The study was inspired by the U.S. Government's debt ceiling debates in 2011 where political parties were prepared to reject a deal even if it appeared to damage their own supporters . \u2018The debate led us to wonder: Are people willing to punish members of another group when they perceive their behaviour as unfair, even when exacting that punishment comes at a personal cost? \u2018It has been suggested that race bias in economic decisions may not occur in a market where discrimination is costly, but these findings provide the first evidence that this assumption is false. \u2018Our work suggests that after offers are on the table, people perceive the fairness of those offers differently - even when they are objectively identical - based on race.\u2019 The study highlighted the fact that the amount of money changing hands was small in the experiments and, had the potential financial gain been greater regardless of how \u2018fair\u2019 the deal was, the participants may have been less likely to reject it. However, Dr Kubota and her colleagues said their findings have 'broad implications' for other situations where people punish others because they think they are being unfair.

Tamoxifen should be given to those women who have a history of the disease in the family, according to NHS guidance. Taking the drug for five years \u2013 costing just \u00a3120 in total \u2013 would cut the risk by more than a third.And the protection could last 20 years, according to clinical trials.

Two men are facing multiple criminal charges after a prank on a friend who was acting as a grand juror went terribly wrong. The incident started on Oct. 16 when detectives from the Pinal County Sheriff's Office in central Arizona were alerted to a threat made against a 41-year-old man from Casa Grande who was serving as the foreman for grand jury proceedings. The foreman told police that, while on break from the proceedings, he had found a troubling handwritten note on his truck that said he had been followed home. The note said: 'You better not find my dad guilty! I followed you home last Wednesday. I know where you live, a--hole! Early Road sound familiar.' Official evidence: This is the note found on the car of a grand jury foreman who was serving in Pinal County Superior Court last week. The note was a prank left by two of the juror's co-workers, but was taken seriously and lead to an extensive process of investigations . The grand jury case was immediately halted as were put on the case to look into the threat. Investigators traced the note - which was written on a guest check commonly used in restaurants - to the L & B restaurant in nearby Florence, according to the Arizona Daily Independent. Upon showing a waitress the note left for the foreman, the waitress said she had found a similar note by the cash register when she came into work that day. She also said the note appeared to be in the same handwriting of another waitress that works at the restaurant. Detectives then spoke with the waitress who wrote the note, who they reported was very cooperate. She said that two men had been in the restaurant the day before and had asked for some writing equipment. They said they planned to play a joke on a co-worker. One of the men wrote the note and then asked the waitress to re-write it so their friend would not recognize the handwriting. The waitress told police she agreed to do it but told the men it was a bad idea. They assured her they intended to tell their friend about the prank the following day at work. Detectives then traced the credit card used to pay the bill at the establishment to a 'W Packard'. Traced: Detectives tracked the threatening note back to this restaurant in Florence, Arizona. As it turned out the two men asked a waitress to write it for them so their friend would not recognize the handwriting . They called the office of the foreman asking for a 'W Packard' but were told he was not in the office. A short time later police received a call from Will Packard, 33, of Marciopa, who said the entire incident was a prank he and Robert Marquez, 35, of Casa Grande, were playing on a co-worker. Packard said he and Marquez had taken photos of the note on the truck and planned to tell the foreman once he returned to work. Detectives notified the foreman about what had happened and he was reportedly upset by what the pair had done. While police were content with the investigations, Sheriff Paul Babeu said the implications of the prank - especially the interruption of a grand jury - were too serious to ignore. 'This case was investigated by multiple detectives who were pulled from other priority cases they were working on,' Sheriff Babeu told the Arizona Daily Independent. Repercussions: The threat interrupted a grand jury trial happening here, at the Pinal County Superior Courthouse . 'Grand jury proceedings were interrupted as well because of the prank these men tried to pull on their friend. 'Hopefully the men find it as funny when they are involved with the judicial process as detectives will submit the investigation to the County Attorney's Office and ask they review the case for criminal charges, including Influencing a Juror, Disorderly Conduct and Threatening and Intimidating.' Pinal Country attorney Lando Voyles aid the case had affected way too many people and cost way too much money to be glossed over as a prank. 'The trauma inflicted on the foreman, the risk of wrongful arrest for the innocent writer of the note, the great expense of the all-out investigation and, most importantly, the overall potential risk of tampering with the integrity of our judicial system requires my office's action,' Mr Voyles told The Arizona Republic.

And it got off to the perfect start as the Portuguese manager led his side to a crucial 3-1 victory at archrivals Barcelona to seal a place in the Spanish Cup final -- one of only two trophies left for the club to win. Now, after another meeting with Barcelona on Saturday in the league, Mourinho will turn his thoughts to the second leg of their last 16 European Champions League tie against English Premier League leaders Manchester United which arrives next week. The sides drew 1-1 in the first leg. Real trail Barca by 14 points in the league, meaning retaining their title is surely beyond them, but with Mourinho seemingly destined to leave the club at the end of the season his tenure will only be deemed a success should he complete a cup double before May is out. That prospect will only have increased after this emphatic victory in the Camp Nou. Barcelona are dominant in the league but seem to be faltering without their manager Tito Vilanova who has been absent since the beginning of February while he has treatment for throat cancer in New York. They were beaten 2-0 by AC Milan in their Champions League last 16 first leg tie, an encounter in which their star striker Lionel Messi had one of his quietest games on record for the club. He was again nullified as Real cruised to a 4-2 aggregate victory. Real got off to the perfect start when their star striker Cristiano Ronaldo won a penalty after a challenge from Gerard Pique on 13 minutes. The Portuguese picked himself off the floor to slam the spot kick into the net. Cesc Fabregas claimed a penalty as Barca looked to level the tie but the referee waved away his appeals before Andres Iniesta cut in from the right and fired wide of the target. Barcelona's best chance of the half came when Alvaro Arbeloa brought down Iniesta on the edge of the penalty area. Messi stepped up to take the free kick but though the ball beat the wall it flashed a foot wide of the post. Sergio Busquets forced Real goalkeeper Diego Lopez into his first save of the match with a shot from the edge of the area that took a deflection off Germany international Sami Khedira. But Ronaldo struck a decisive second just before the hour mark. A long ball downfield saw Angel Di Maria beat Barca captain Carles Puyol and though his shot was saved by Pinto, Ronaldo was on hand to tuck home his 16th goal in 19 cup games for Real. It got worse for Barca as Real's young French centre half Raphael Varane rose unchecked from a corner to head home a third goal that truly knocked the stuffing out of the home side. Jordi Alba grabbed a late consolation goal for Barcelona but by that time many of the 90,000 fans had made their way to the exits. Real will face either city rivals Atletico Madrid or Sevilla in the final. Atletico take a 2-1 first leg lead to Sevilla on Wednesday night. In the English FA Cup, Premier League outfit Everton breezed past third tier Oldham Atheltic in their fifth round replay. Oldham, who eliminated Everton's Merseyside rivals Liverpool in round four, earned a replay with an injury-time equaliser in the original tie but couldn't spring another surprise at Goodison Park, losing 3-1. First half goals from Kevin Mirallas and England international Leighton Baines put Everton in control before Leon Osman made it 3-0 on the hour mark. Matt Smith grabbed a consolation for Oldham.

Now it has also secured a nobler aim \u2013 and forced his school into a climbdown over its ban on shorts. Chris, 13, made headlines with his outrageous method of protest at being prevented from wearing shorts in hot weather. Skirting the issue: Chris Whitehead, pictured last year, has finally made a breakthrough against his school's uniform policy following his unusual protest . He brought national scrutiny to the uniform policy at Impington Village College, Cambridgeshire, when he turned up for lessons in a knee-length skirt last year. He claimed it was unfair that girls were allowed to wear skirts while boys were banned from wearing shorts. Forcing boys to wear long trousers during warm weather had a negative effect on their concentration, he argued. Around 30 friends joined him at the school gates to beg headteacher Robert Campbell to reconsider. They displayed banners reading \u2018Cool Shorts Not Hot Pants\u2019, \u2018Shorts For The Long-term\u2019 and \u2018Boy\u2019s Legs Deserve Better\u2019, . Equality: Chris had argued it was unfair male pupils were made to wear trousers even in sweltering summer months . Yesterday Chris claimed victory after the school announced that boys would be allowed to wear shorts after half-term for the rest of the school year. The youngster, who hopes to become a politician, welcomed the decision but added: \u2018It\u2019s a shame that only a little has changed after such a long uniform review. It seems that the adults influenced the decision more than the students themselves.\u2019 The 1,368-pupil school, which was classed as \u2018good\u2019 in its latest Ofsted inspection in 2006, imposed the shorts ban two years ago after a consultation with parents and teachers. Its code stated that students must wear \u2018plain black tailored trousers or knee-length skirts without slits\u2019 \u2013 but did not specify gender. This meant that while shorts were prohibited, boys were free to wear skirts as long as they were \u2018free-moving, not tight against the legs\u2019. Chris won support across the country, with Daybreak presenter Adrian Chiles donning a skirt in solidarity. The schoolboy was even named runner-up in Liberty\u2019s human rights young person of the year competition in London. Yesterday his parents Brian Whitehead and Liz Hill said: \u2018We hope that Chris\u2019s campaign inspires other young people to take a stand for things they believe in. \u2018In this case, he has won his campaign for shorts \u2013 if only for a trial period \u2013 but in the future there will no doubt be other more significant issues for him to engage with.\u2019"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chris Whitehead protested Impington Village College's shorts ban by wearing a skirt.

Filed against AEG, the company behind Jackson\u2019s ill-fated \u2018This Is It\u2019 tour, the suit includes all three of the icon\u2019s children as well as his mother Katherine and alleges the company contributed to Jackson\u2019s death by pushing him to work too hard ahead of the tour and by hiring the doctor responsible for giving Jackson the drugs that killed him. As part of the trial\u2019s potential award phase, AEG is prepared to present to the court evidence that, despite Jackson\u2019s claims, only one of the children is the King of Pop\u2019s biological child. Michael's? A suit filed by Michael Jackson's family may answer the question of who fathered Paris, Prince, and Blanket .

They have begged her not to allow AEG to include biological evidence of the children\u2019s parentage in the case, arguing it is irrelevant and only a means of damaging the family reputation. But AEG maintains that Jackson\u2019s claim that he fathered all the children himself is part of a bigger pattern. Origins: Paris, 15 (left), and Prince, 16 (right), likely know Debbie Rowe is their mom, but a new report alleges Michael is definitely not their dad . \u2018There was a whole lot that Michael Jackson or his family wasn\u2019t and isn\u2019t being forthcoming about,\u2019 said the Post\u2019s source at AEG . \u2018The drug use by Jackson, his use of alcohol, his relationship with his own family, and the identities of the children\u2019s parents.\u2019 Michael Jackson died in June 2009 after his personal doctor Conrad Murray administered a dose of the anaesthetic propofol that proved deadly for the singer. In the suit against AEG, the family claims the concert company failed to properly vet Murray, who they hired on behalf of Jackson. Though the biological origins of the Jackson children remain a mystery on the father\u2019s side, many agree on who their mothers are. Paris, 15, and Prince, 16, for instance, have a mother in former Jackson nurse Debbie Rowe. And many take as fact the assertion that Blanket\u2019s mother is an unnamed San Diego-area Hispanic woman. Young Michael: Prior to Michael Jackson's (left) plastic surgeries, many say he looked a lot like son Blanket (right) and a new report alleges 10-year-old Blanket is Jackson's only biological legacy .

Luckily for pet-loving Camilla, the visit wasn't all animal parts and surgery, with the Duchess breaking into a smile after finding some living animals to pet. Scroll down for video . Ugh! The Duchess looks aghast after being handed a plasticised dog heart to hold . One of them was a lurcher named Dogmatix, who thumped his tail hopefully as the Duchess approached. She immediately obliged, with the dog, who was at the hospital for a routine examination, looking beseechingly up at Camilla while she patted him. Another pet waiting in the consulting room was Jessica, a fluffy feline whose less-than-impressed expression was enough to rival Grumpy Cat's. Owned by the Fluin family, the cat spent the royal visit staring moodily at the table and refused to engage with either nurses or Duchess. Camilla, who was elegant in a blue cashmere suit by couturier Roy Allen, had more luck with a bearded dragon named Nugget, which was happy to be petted by the Duchess.

Cross: The pet remained unmoved by the royal visit, despite Camilla's best efforts . Having toured the wards, Camilla ventured into the teaching part of the hospital where she encountered a familiar face - a horse named Foxhunter which had been through the same plasticisation process as the dog heart. 'I do remember seeing him jump many years ago!' said the Duchess of the horse, which was part of Britain's show jumping team at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Foxhunter, a 16.3hh golden bay gelding, took bronze during that event and went on to amass several more medals before dying in 1959. Camilla's visit to the Beaumont Salisbury Animal Hospital came as part of her work with the Animal Care Trust, of which she has been patron since 2005. Hello there: The Duchess peered into one of the clinic cages for a better look at a sick iguana . Shy: Rather than face the cameras, one ginger cat chose to hide behind its blanket instead . Model student: Jess Mullard showed the Duchess a horse head she had made from cloth . Enjoying herself: Camilla chatted to student Jade Johnson during a reception at the end of the visit . The ACT is the Royal Veterinary College\u2019s  registered charity and it raises funds to support research into improving veterinary treatment and training budding medics. Speaking after the visit, Professor Stuart Reid, principal of the Royal Veterinary College, said: 'The generous donations to the ACT are invaluable in helping us to deliver the best possible care to our patients and world-leading veterinary education to our students.

A serious challenge for the Claret Jug this week appeared\u00a0 beyond even Woods\u2019s superhuman powers. But Woods was in bullish mood on Tuesday morning having spent several days at the scene of one of his greatest victories and was adamant that a fourth Open title is firmly on his mind.

Preparation: Woods practices at Hoylake on Tuesday ahead of his quest to win The Open . At a press conference ahead of The Open, Woods was asked what an acceptable finish would be given his recent injury turmoil.\u00a0 \u2018First\u2019 came the quick reply.\u00a0 Asked if anything less than first was unacceptable,\u00a0 Woods responded flatly: \u2018That\u2019s always the case.\u2019 Woods arrived at Hoylake on Saturday afternoon and quickly played a practice round on the course where he won his third Open in 2006, just two months after his father Earl had died of cancer. The American superstar said he also practiced on Sunday before taking Monday off to rest. He clearly likes what he sees flying off the clubface. The key to Woods\u2019s confidence is being pain-free, which he says has not been the case for many years. Woods said emerging unscathed from his comeback tournament at Congressional in Washington last week was a \u2018big boost\u2019, despite missing the cut. Previous: The 38-year-old has won The Open on three previous occasions, in 2000, 2005 and 2006 . \u2018It\u2019s getting better,\u2019 said Woods. \u2018There\u2019s no pain.

He added: \u2018I\u2019m not quite at the level I think I can be at in terms of explosion through the golf ball but I\u2019m pretty darn close.\u2019 Woods pointed out that arguably his greatest victory had come on the back of serious surgery. He stunned the world by winning the 2008 US Open at Torrey Pines despite having undergone keyhole surgery on his left knee just weeks before, while also suffering from stress fractures in his left leg and a ruined anterior cruciate ligament.

I won it. I didn\u2019t break 50 for nine holes before but I won the US Open with a broken leg and torn ACL.\u2019 Woods admitted that this injury, however, had been the toughest he had ever had to deal with. So tough, in fact, that it could have forced him to retire from the game. \u2018There was point in time when my knee was bad and it was tough,\u2019 said the 38-year-old. \u2018But with this injury I didn\u2019t want to do anything. I couldn\u2019t get out of bed, move around house or anything. It made me appreciate how I was able to play for so long such a high level. With no ACL I could still play. Not with this injury. I couldn\u2019t enjoy my life.\u2019 \u2018If I was still feeling like that then I couldn\u2019t play again. People who have had my surgery say the same thing: it changes your whole life. I don\u2019t have pain all the way down my leg now. But I knew I could come back. It was just a matter of time before I could play at the elite level.\u2019 Woods has had to battle through more than just injury since he broke down in tears on Hoylake\u2019s 18th green six years ago. Infamous issues in his private life have changed forever the way he will be perceived by the world. But Woods revealed that his previous visit to Hoylake was one of just a few times in his entire career where he has \u2018felt at peace\u2019 on the course. The other occasions were his record-breaking victories at Augusta in 1997 and Pebble Beach in 2000, two of the most destructive performances in the game\u2019s history. \u2018It just happens,\u2019 he said. \u2018Maybe because I was in control of my game. The times I\u2019ve had that feeling I\u2019ve played really well. Everything was working. On the Sunday I felt my dad was with me. It felt like he was my 15th club.

Children born last year are more likely than any previous generation to see their parents split up, research suggests. Nearly half will experience family breakdown, according to a report by the Marriage Foundation think tank. Its researchers estimate that 354,000 out of the 729,674 children born in England and Wales in 2012 will have parents who are separated by the time they reach the age of 15. Half of children born last year will see their parents split up, research from the Marriage Foundation suggests . The report also suggests that married couples are much more likely to stay together than those who are unmarried. The vast majority of children whose parents will still be together by their mid-teens will have a mother and father who are married, the report said. Only 5 per cent will have unmarried parents. Harry Benson, of the Marriage Foundation, said: \u2018We continually hear about divorce rates shooting up and causing the exponential rise in family breakdown, but this is demonstrably not the case. \u2018The percentage of marriages ending in divorce has actually fallen since 2005 to 42 per cent. For all marriages lasting over ten years, the divorce rate has barely changed since the 1960s. Chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw linked social problems in Britain to bad parenting . \u2018It is the declining rates of marriage which provide the only conceivable explanation of the doubling of family breakdown since the 1980s. \u2018Of the teenagers not living with both parents, just 32 per cent of cases involved divorce.\u2019 Last week a report by the\u00a0 chief inspector of schools Sir Michael Wilshaw linked social problems in Britain to bad parenting. He criticised \u2018hollowed-out and fragmented families\u2019 where parents suffer a \u2018poverty of accountability\u2019. Sir Michael said many children were \u2018alienated\u2019 from their fathers, and warned of social problems resulting from \u2018making excuses\u2019 for bad parents. \u2018Some people will tell you that social breakdown is the result of material poverty \u2013 it\u2019s more than this,\u2019 he said. \u2018These children lack more than money: They lack parents who take responsibility for seeing them raised well. It is this poverty of accountability which costs them. \u2018These children suffer because they are not given clear rules or boundaries, have few secure or safe attachments at home, and little understanding of the difference between right and wrong behaviour.\u2019 Findings from the Centre for Social Justice have shown as many as one million children are growing up without a father. The report suggested married couples are much more likely to stay together than those who are unmarried . The Centre has also linked family breakdown to the likelihood of children being involved in truancy, juvenile delinquency and alcohol or drug abuse. The Marriage Foundation called on ministers to do more to help married couples and protect families in which children are raised. It was founded by the High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge and seeks to improve public understanding of marriage. Its study comes at a time when the popularity of marriage is at an historic low. There were 241,100 weddings in England and Wales in 2010 compared with more than 400,000 a year in the early 1970s.

Eleven's hour is over now, the clock is striking Twelve's.\" With those poetic words, Jenna Coleman's Clara Oswald summed up the stakes of Wednesday night's Christmas episode of \"Doctor Who.\" Following a hugely successful, well-received 50th anniversary episode last month, it seemed fitting that the show would bid goodbye to Matt Smith for an encore. The episode certainly ran the gamut, at various times showing the Doctor bald, naked and growing very old. It was a bittersweet night for \"Who\" fans (or \"Whovians\"), to say the least. Of course, we've known for several months that this was coming, but the reactions on social media made clear that many in the audience weren't ready to say goodbye to Smith's Eleventh Doctor. \"Oh gosh. I'm emotionally wrecked,\" tweeted Kyle Williams. \"MY FEELINGS ARE NOT OK,\" is how Vera Raposo put it. So without further ado, here are five moments from the episode that had us feeling all of our feelings: . 1. The Doctor leaves Clara (twice) Things started off smoothly enough, with the Doctor pretending to be Clara's boyfriend at Christmas dinner. A few sitcom-ish moments (and Daleks, weeping angels and Cybermen -- including one disembodied) later, and soon the Doctor learned that Gallifrey and the other Time Lords could soon return, using a crack in the wall, in a small town called Christmas -- a time field seen in the Eleventh Doctor's first episode. The Daleks, Cybermen and more were ready to take on the Time Lords, however, and the Doctor was prepared to literally save Christmas (not to mention the entire planet, Trenzalore). But he didn't think he could protect Clara and sent her back home without her knowledge. As centuries went by on Trenzalore, the Doctor started to show his age and finally, Clara returned with the TARDIS and the \"feels\" came along with her. Seeing the Doctor and his companion -- who had earlier unwittingly declared her feelings for him -- reunited was a hugely uplifting moment, though soon the Doctor sent her away again, after saying he wouldn't. (Sorry, Clara, the Doctor lies.) But she returned one last time... Looking back on 50 years of 'Doctor Who' 2. The last Doctor? Those who've followed \"Doctor Who\" for a while will remember there's a limit to the number of regenerations he gets, exactly 12. After Clara returned the first time, the aging Doctor told Clara that he had used them all up, counting John Hurt's War Doctor from the previous episode, and a time when the Tenth Doctor regenerated into himself. Could this be the end of the Doctor for good? After her second return, having read the aforementioned poem from a Christmas cracker, and as the Doctor began to die of old age, she pleaded with the time field to save him. As the Daleks prepared to attack, the time field appeared, granting the Doctor more regenerative energy, which he used to lay waste to all of the invading armies (\"Love from Gallifrey, boys!\") -- but it also meant that his time was up. 3. Goodbye, Eleven . Clara returned to the TARDIS, finding the Doctor back to his old self again. But despite his reset youthful appearance, he was still dying. He had a lot to think about in his final moments in this body. \"We all change. When you think about it, we're all different people all through our lives,\" he said. \"And that's OK, that's good, as long as you keep moving, as long as you remember all the people that you used to be. I will not forget one line of this, not one day, I swear. I will always remember when the Doctor was me.\" Lump in the throat, anyone? Is the Pope a Time Lord? 4. 'Raggedy man' Then the Doctor remembered his first companion, the first face he saw in this body: Amy Pond. In a surprise appearance, Karen Gillan returned for a cameo as Amy, to say, \"Raggedy man, good night.\" Is it any wonder that \"Raggedy man\" trended worldwide for hours on Twitter? Eleven knew his time was up, and took off his trademark bowtie. And at this point, the Internet had a good cry. 5. Enter Twelve .

No other movement for equality in the United States has ever traveled so far or so quickly as the push for equality for gay men and women. I have a vivid memory of a dinner at Gracie Mansion with Tom Stoddard, an early leader of the gay rights movement, and Ed Koch, then the mayor of New York, sometime in the late '80s, when the idea of same-sex marriage was first in the air. \"If you think people are going to go for this, you're crazy!\" Koch said. I'm sure I agreed with Koch at the time. As a gay man who came out the year after the Stonewall riots, I have witnessed more change than I had ever imagined would be possible in my own lifetime. When I was a reporter for The New York Times in the 1970s, like every other gay employee there, I was securely in the closet. No gay person there believed his or her career could survive a disclosure about sexual orientation. Opinion: Fight for gay rights must continue . In fact, in 1980, there was exactly one openly gay reporter at a daily paper in New York City: Joe Nicholson of the New York Post. By 1996, more than 300 of Nicholson's colleagues at other mainstream media outlets had followed his example. That gives a small idea of how far and how quickly we have come. With Wednesday's two decisions from the Supreme Court, one ordering the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages wherever they occur, the other reinstating marriage equality in California by letting a lower court ruling stand, the court's five-member majority has placed itself firmly on the right side of history. This is the third historic gay rights decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. The first one was Romer v. Evans, in 1996, when the court threw out a Colorado state constitutional amendment that had forbidden protection for gay people from discrimination. The second one was Lawrence v. Texas, decided 10 years ago on Wednesday, which outlawed every state statute that had criminalized same-sex love-making. The harbingers for Wednesday's decision were clearly in place in Kennedy's Colorado opinion. In 1996, he wrote, \"A state cannot ... deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws.\" The Colorado provision had singled out gay people as \"a solitary class,\" creating a legal disability so sweeping, it could only be explained \"by animus.\" On Wednesday, Kennedy wrote that the Defense of Marriage Act \"writes inequality into the entire United States code.\"... (Its]) principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and make them unequal.\" The court called DOMA an \"unusual deviation from the tradition of recognizing and accepting the benefits and responsibilities that come with federal recognition of their marriages. This is strong evidence of a law having the purpose and effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state law. DOMA's avowed purpose and practical effect are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the states.\" Among other things, Wednesday's decision is a reminder of just how important the political process is to progress in America. The first person nominated by Ronald Reagan to fill what is now Kennedy's seat was Robert Bork. Bork was a fierce opponent of equal rights for gay people, and if the Democrats in the United States Senate had not blocked his nomination, opening the way to Kennedy's appointment, none of these historic decisions might have been possible. Opinion: How youth led change in public attitudes . Wednesday's decisions also would likely not have happened without the election of Barack Obama in 2008. As Andrew Tobias, treasurer of the Democratic National Committee, said Wednesday, John McCain repeatedly promised to appoint justices like John Roberts and Antonin Scalia, both of whom were in the minority on DOMA. \"So the vote would have been 6 to 3 against, instead of 5 to 4 in favor,\" Tobias said, without the votes of Obama appointees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. James Esseks,director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender & AIDS Project, said, \"One of the things that's really important about the DOMA decision is that it gets rid of the core of the last federal law that requires discrimination against gay people. The country used to have a lot of laws that required discrimination against gay people,\" including an executive order signed by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953 that banned gay employees in the federal government and all its contractors (an order that remained in effect until it was vacated in 1975). \"Until 1991, federal immigration law actually barred gay people from entering the country,\" Esseks recalled. We still have a long way to go. While the Proposition 8 ruling makes California the 13th state to allow same-sex marriage, there are still 37 that do not. For more than 30 years, Congress has refused to pass a law that would make it illegal to fire someone because of his or her sexual orientation, and there is no chance that will change as long as Republicans control the House. Bullying of gay children and gay teenagers also remains routine at elementary schools and high schools throughout the land. There is something bittersweet about a decision that expands the equality of gay people the day after the same court, including Kennedy, issued a horrendous decision gutting the Voting Rights Act, perhaps the most important civil rights achievement of our time. This is especially true because the black civil rights movement provided all the blueprints that made the gay movement possible. Opinion: The only history that counts for me is my own . But Wednesday is still a day for great celebration. On Wednesday my country continued its journey toward fundamental fairness for people like me faster than any member of my generation ever thought it could.

Out on the breakfast buffet, with OJ leading the way and perhaps a choice of grapefruit, apple or tomato for the daring few who may feel like deviating from the mainstream. Well, think again. Juice -- freshly-squeezed from an arcane assortment of veggies as well as fruit, and in more combinations than you can imagine, has become a unique selling point at several hotels this year. These are places that believe juice is not just for breakfast, but at the center of wellness or detox programs they say jaded travelers are crying out for. \"Business as well as leisure guests are buying big into our juice offerings,\" says Mina Gough, spa director of The Standard, Miami, which has done so well with a new juice and wellness program, other hotels in the group are preparing to follow suit. \"There's been a real buzz in the group about how so many different categories of guests have embraced the chance to detox with fresh juice,\" she says. \"Business travelers may not be able to devote themselves to the full wellness program, with scrubs and massages, but they'll still do juice for breakfast and lunch, then go out for a regular business dinner. \"They like the way it makes them feel so much, many finish their stay with a full-day juice detox.\" These are not any old juices -- for morning, The Standard is currently blending cantaloupe and ginger into its freshly-squeezed OJ -- the ginger works as an anti-inflammatory -- and proposing a pint of tomato-carrot-red pepper-cucumber-fennel and lime juice midmorning to improve digestive health. It gets a little out there by evening, when a pint of green juice pressed from kale, collard greens, romaine, cucumber and green apple is proposed as a meal replacement designed to detox the blood. Working in the hotel? Room service is ready to deliver coconut water to sip throughout the day. A less likely venue than a Miami Beach spa for a detox program is a big city hotel. But the InterContinental on London's Park Lane is introducing just that, under the direction of Thandie Newton's naturopath, Elizabeth Peyton-Jones. \"It will give all the tools and support needed to begin a new lifestyle, including a pre-stay fridge analysis, a two-week detox and a follow-up motivation call,\" says hotel spokesperson Patty Kahn. \"We know many guests are looking for ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle while traveling,\" she adds, noting that the hotel will also create juices to guests' own specifications, even if they're not registered for the detox experience, which must be booked ahead. No advance warning, however, is needed for delivery of an Antioxidant Revival drink (apple, raspberry and blackberry juice), a Vitamin C Blast (orange, mango and pineapple), an apple-ginger-cucumber Booster and similar health drinks. All are available at every bar and restaurant in the hotel or 24/7 via Room Service. Another London hotel embracing juice in a big way is the uber-cool Sanderson, whose Long Bar has a \"sin-free\" section where mixologists create health drinks. Choices include the Cellulite Reduction Cocktail (pink grapefruit, orange, dandelion, burdock, lemon and pineapple juice) and the Jetlag Rescue Smoothie in which scary-sounding \"stabilized oxygen\" is added to orange juice with hemp seeds and vitamin C powder. In the Agua spa, guests can find more exotic drinks like goji berries from the high Tibetan plateau, blended with seaberry, pomegranate or lychee juice. Guests can also create their own smoothies at the Sanderson, indicating that juicing may become an activity in its own right rather than merely a means to an end. At the Four Seasons Biltmore in Santa Barbara, California, guests can create their own combinations from an assortment of fruit and veg including kale, beets, parsley, ginger and celery at the Fins organic juice bar. And the Travaasa \"experiential\" resort is offering an actual class in pressing fresh juice at both its Austin, Texas and Maui properties -- yes, it's called Juicing 2.0. And it's also not just for breakfast -- guests learn to convert what they've pressed into soups, dips, spreads, desserts and salsas as well as mere healthy juices. Other places to get stuck seriously into the fresh stuff include: . LaSource, Grenada This luxury, all-inclusive spa resort puts fresh juice at the center of its holistic offerings, allowing lots of experimentation at no extra cost. The cafe-deli features such unusual combinations as the High C (celery stalks, carrot, parsley and asparagus) to prevent arthritis and lower blood pressure, the anti-oxidant ABC Trio (apple, beet and carrot) and the Power Ball high-protein drink involving fresh papaya juice and - er - peanut butter. It contains soy isoflavones which some say help reduce bad cholesterol, regulate glucose levels and improve kidney filtration. Missoni, Kuwait Creative Director Rosita Missoni has created juice pairings for food in the restaurants and bars of the fashion brand's first resort, as well as a range of stylish \"mocktails.\" Guests can opt for a \"heavenly orchard,\" featuring, apple, pear, quince and citrus juices blended with locally-grown cinnamon. They can get a blackberry julep in which the berries are pressed with plenty of fresh mint, then hit with fresh lime juice and a shot of sparkling water. Destinations where you don't need a fancy hotel to get superb freshly-squeezed juice include: . Bali -- Juice stands abound, pressing everything from bananas (much juicier than starchy western varieties) to avocados, with all the other usual fruit and veggie suspects. Your hotel will offer them too. Israel -- Residents love fresh carrot juice even more than their freshly squeezed OJ, and often combine them half and half. Look for juice stands everywhere in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and expect to find fresh carrot juice on the breakfast buffet alongside a wide variety of other juices. Morocco -- Freshly squeezed OJ is a birthright in this country, and in Marrakech you'll find at least 20 stands competing for your business on the main square, the Dja el Fnaa. Since it costs less than 35 cents a glass, you can try all the vendors to find your favorite before your stay is out, but you may want to bring your own glass for hygiene reasons.

Coordinating a mass alien invasion B. Invoking tidal waves and tornadoes C. Telling a prehistoric love story. Roland Emmerich and Steven Strait (D'Leh) discuss a scene shot in Namibia when the young hunter discovers farming for the first time. For Roland Emmerich, the answer is C. He says \"10,000 BC\" is without a doubt the most difficult film he's ever made. It wasn't the time-consuming graphics that took the greatest toll, nor the need to re-record a lot of the dialogue. No, the most challenging aspect of this film was, um, the weather. \"You're obsessed with the weather channel,\" Emmerich says, of the duration of filming. \"Ninety percent of this movie was [shot] outdoors.\" Producer Michael Wimer: \"It seemed like every time we needed sun, we'd get rain, every time we needed green landscape, we'd get snow. There we just got a series of curve balls, the weather is really fickle.\" Emmerich says: \"It's like somebody didn't like 'Day After Tomorrow' and was like: 'We showed him.'\" Filming started in the wintry peaks of New Zealand's South Island, then moved to Cape Town in South Africa, then further north to the desert of Namibia. But it wasn't just the weather that tested the filmmakers' skill, patience and stamina.  see scenes from the film \u00bb . Prehistoric beasts . Visual effects supervisor Karen Goulekas started working on project two years before principal filming even started. She broke down the script to see what could be done, and what couldn't, then set about the bringing prehistoric animals back to life. Perhaps her biggest challenge was to create the film's \"terror birds\", flightless predators with huge beaks that hunt like sharks, suddenly piercing through long grass to snatch their prey before disappearing again. The birds were based on a number of images. During filming the terrifying bird was actually a blue head on a stick. \"It's been an experience,\" says Camilla Belle (Evolet), \"I've never worked with blue birds before and all that fun stuff.\"  see D'Leh take on the terror birds \u00bb . Sets . After seeing off all manner of prehistoric threats, the film's hero D'Leh and his assembled army are awestruck by an immense 'lost' civilization dominated by pyramids that reach up into the sky. Not only did the filmmaker build the pyramids (at Dune 7 in Namibia), they also built miniature replicas of the pyramids, 'God's palace', the slave quarters and the Nile River. The buildings were made in Munich before being transport to Namibia in 15 sea containers. Once assembled, they covered an area of 100 square meters. see the pyramids during a battle scene in the film . Costumes . What to wear when you live in 10,000 BC? Presumably there wasn't much choice in those days, which gave the film's costume designers plenty of scope to use their imagination. They dressed the Yagahl tribe, or mammoth hunters, in antelope fur and hides in place of mammoth. But the weather was so cold during filming that some actors also wore thermals underneath. The final scenes required dressing 800 extras as slaves. Each costume had to be handmade to conceal the stitching. Says costume designer Renee April: \"We had an army in the workshops making beads from clay and glass and sewing them onto the costumes as well as making the fabric and headdresses.\" 1000 sandals also had to be made to order. Sound . Most of the dialogue in the film had to be recorded not once, but twice. Peter Gleaves, an Automated Dialogue Replacement Mixer at De Lane Lea Studios in Soho, London explains: \"The original sound sometimes has background noises -- wind machines, sounds of cars and aeroplanes -- that in a production like '10,000 BC' you don't want to hear. So to get rid of them you have to get the actors to redo all their lines, or most of their lines.\" Steven Strait was summoned to London to re-record some of his dialogue. When the Revealed cameras dropped in he was working on his grunts. see Steven Strait grunting and panting! \"It's an action sequence,\" Strait explains, \"so there are very few words.

If your belief is that the private sector holds the answers to all that ails us, it seems like you would want to go out and prove the case. So the May 9 vote by the House GOP to eliminate the American Community Survey, which collects statistics about the nation's population, is confusing. Doing away with the data collection would seem to commit two cardinal sins against the right's ideology: Make government less efficient and eliminate a critical tool for profit-driven business. You may not know the American Community Survey as separate from the U.S. census. While the census takes place once every 10 years, the ACS is an ongoing data collection survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau to provide more in-depth and current statistics about demographic patterns in America. This information is crucial if you care about smart direction of the $400 billion in annual state and federal grants to schools, hospitals, infrastructure projects and other critical services. The data derived from the survey provides guidance about how to divvy up best those hard-earned taxpayer dollars so that they are spent with as much care and precision as possible. Apparently, that dynamic is lost on U.S. Rep. Daniel Webster, a Republican who beat Alan Grayson to win Florida's 8th Congressional District in 2010. He introduced the amendment to repeal the survey as a way to make good on his campaign promise to \"stop wasteful spending.\" With the affirmative House vote, he hopes to save $2.5 billion over the next decade. Here's the rub though. If Webster gets his way, Americans will spend $4 trillion in that same time period with no data to guide the funds -- essentially shooting in the dark with a massive amount of money. That's the antithesis of efficiency; vastly more than $2.4 billion is likely to be wasted in the process. It seems that along with climate change and evolution, statistical science now appears to be viewed with suspicion by the tea party. I've not heard an alternative: perhaps a dartboard with pictures of all the states on it? The GOP claims the survey is intrusive. But I have to wonder if the vote to repeal the survey is just a step toward tea party Republicans' Holy Grail of eliminating government spending entirely and with it, the $400 billion in annual disbursements. If that is the path forward, let's look at where that road functionally leads us: Without the American Community Survey, we won't know where veterans are living, so we can't get them the financial assistance they're owed for their service to our country. Without the federal and state grants, we simply can't take care of them at all once they come home. Without the survey, we can't know where there are pockets of uninsured people, so health care funds can be directed toward offsetting the costs of emergency room visits. Without the state and federal grants, doctors will be forced either to let people suffer and die or raise costs on all their patients to make good on their Hippocratic oath. Without the survey, we won't know where Americans still lack flush toilets and therefore risk contaminating the groundwater we all drink. Without the federal and state grants, we can't mitigate the impact of raw sewage on our water supply and prevent disease from spreading when our water gets tainted. Webster might say: \"Let the private sector take care of it.\" On that point, we can agree: The private sector can and should play a larger role maintaining the health of our country. The flaw in that plan is that our business sector is very reliant on the American Community Survey in making decisions about how best to serve their customers. That's why trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Homebuilders have voiced their opposition to the Webster amendment. The data provided from the survey has informed everything from where to locate new stores to what kinds of products are popular with consumers. These trade groups are hardly a bastion for government expansionists, and their opposition to this bill reveals the critical wedge in the Republican coalition. The business-first wing of the party is all too happy to allow government to foot the bill -- in this case, for solid market research -- when it's convenient for them. The small-government ideologues are more than happy to dismantle government piece by piece even when it harms business and creates bad spending strategies. When asked about the elimination of the survey, MIT economist Jonathan Gruber said, \"If you're opposed to the survey, you're opposed to understanding what's going on in America.\" For this reason, it will be an uphill climb to get the measure to pass the Senate and get signed by the president. Still, the initiative and the vote are telling. If knowledge is power and ignorance is bliss, eliminating the American Community Survey will only pay dividends for those who live in powerful bliss. The rest of us would have to suffer through the mess being made of the informed and democratic process.

He had no history of violent behavior. But he was interested in mass murderers. Nearly a year since the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School where Lanza killed 26 people, Connecticut's state attorney office released its official report that tried to piece together what happened. The investigation provided some insights into the life and actions of the gunman, but his motive remains a mystery. The report suggests that improving the delivery of mental health care to those with chronic mental illness may be an important element in reducing certain acts of violence, and that mass shooters are not \"enthralled\" with violent video games. Lanza was a young man with clear mental health issues. He appears to have been isolated, even communicating with his mother mainly through e-mail despite their living in the same house. It seems he had some obsessive-compulsive qualities related to food preferences, dislike of loud noises or being touched, and a disdain for holidays and birthdays. Lanza's issues with social communication and problems with crowds worsened in later years. He was also diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. The report notes he declined to take any medications or participate in behavioral therapy. However, it makes no mention of him being aggressive or violent before the shooting. The report does suggest he had an interest in things related to death and mass shootings. Lanza had a spreadsheet of mass murderers. He also had literature related to pedophilia -- but no child pornography. From all of this information it's hard to draw any conclusion. But it's fair to say that chronic mental health issues are common among mass shooters, including Lanza. On the other hand, it's important to note that most individuals with chronic mental illness are not violent. Nor is Asperger's syndrome linked to violence. The tragedy at Sandy Hook may represent a missed opportunity to have a frank discussion about our inadequate mental health system. Other than a few nods to the issue we didn't have that discussion. Mainly, we talked about gun control and video games. This is too bad. While it's certainly true that most mentally ill people are nonviolent, research also suggests that chronic mental health issues such as psychosis or depression are risk factors for violence, particularly when mixed with chronic anger. We must do more to take away the stigma associated with mental illness. Yet pretending no relationship exists between mental health issues and some acts of violence may backfire by reducing our sense of urgency in improving the mental health care system. As for the issue of video games, the Sandy Hook shooting set off a year's worth of speculation about the harm violent video games may or may not do and whether they are a threat to society. The report, in the end, had relatively little to say about video games and did not link them to the shooting. For example, much like any 20-year-old, Lanza played an assortment of both violent and nonviolent games. But it turns out that he was fond of games that were nonviolent, particularly \"Super Mario Brothers\" and \"Dance Dance Revolution.\" Despite speculation and efforts by some politicians such as Sen. Jay Rockefeller and Rep. Frank Wolf to tie mass shootings to violent video games, Lanza's video game playing was unremarkable. Once again we are reminded of our society's eagerness to assign blame quickly even if evidence suggests otherwise. For example, the youth violence rate has actually declined by nearly 90% during the video game era. That statistic is one reason why policymakers should not rush forward with regulations before we get the full picture. In the end, we may simply never know why Lanza did what he did other than that he was a disturbed, angry young man who made the choice to do something horrible. Perhaps it is time to stop looking for external explanations for his behavior and acknowledge that this catastrophic choice was his and his alone.

Expecting freezing cold water, perilous winds and crashing waves, he made meticulous preparations for a swim across the English Channel. But there was one test that endurance athlete John van Wisse didn\u2019t bargain on yesterday \u2013 running into the border authorities as he set out from Dover because locals feared he was an illegal immigrant. As the Australian leapt into the water from a boat beneath the famous white cliffs, two eagle-eyed citizens spotted his bronzed features \u2026 and dialled 999. John Van Wisse, 41, was mistaken for an illegal immigrant while trying to beat 'Arch to Arc' triathlon record . Kent police arrived at Shakespeare beach in Dover this morning to look for the reported illegal immigrant, who was in fact a sportsman trying to break the triathlon record from London to Paris . Minutes later, the combined might of Kent Constabulary, Port of Dover Police, the coastguard and Border Force officials descended on Shakespeare Beach expecting to find a migrant struggling ashore after crossing illegally from Calais. Instead, they discovered the 41-year-old athlete \u2013 who had simply been posing for a photo before starting the next stage of his record attempt at a London-to-Paris triathlon. Luckily, Mr van Wisse and his team laughed off the official interruption as \u2018priceless\u2019. And according to a witness, police \u2013 who arrived at the beach expecting to find one of the thousands of migrants who have been massing at a camp on the French coast \u2013 also saw the funny side. Drama over, the Melbourne-based champion swimmer and cross-Channel veteran yesterday continued the middle leg of his 289-mile journey to run, swim and cycle between the English and French capitals. Before setting off he explained: \u2018It\u2019s the hardest thing I know and I just want to see if I can do it. I know it\u2019s going to be tough but I\u2019m up for the challenge.\u2019 John Van Wisse, 41, had run 86 miles from London to Dover, which he completed in 15 hours 53 minutes yesterday, and is currently swimming from Dover to Calais in tricky conditions . Mr Van Wisse had just seven and a half hours rest between the run from London to Dover and swim to Calais . Mr van Wisse started the 86-mile running stage at London\u2019s Marble Arch on Tuesday. It was timed to make the best use of tide times and conditions in the Channel, although it appears that news of his arrival might have escaped official logs in Dover. Blessed with a prayer by an inquisitive priest who encountered him earlier in Canterbury (\u2018May you always stay afloat,\u2019 the good Father said) he grabbed some slow-release energy from a takeaway pizza and few hours\u2019 sleep before heading to the water.

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has spoken out in the wake of Snowden's first televised interview that aired on NBC Wednesday night. When asked if Snowden's claim was true, Ms Rice bluntly said: 'No'. 'Edward Snowden was a contractor working for the NSA and other elements of the intelligence community,' she said to CNN's Wolf Blitzer after being prompted with another question. His side: Edward Snowden told NBC's Brian Williams that he previously worked as an undercover operative for the CIA and the NSA, but the government has since denied those claims . 'Obviously he\u2019s accused of sharing and disclosing, illegally, some of the most sensitive information of the United States government, allegedly, and our strong view is that rather than give television interviews, he ought to come home and have his day in court where he will be treated with all of the protections and fairness that our judicial system allows.' Speaking out: Susan Rice told CNN that Snowden never served in such capacities and he should come back to America to be brought to court . Her comments come after Brian William's full interview with Snowden aired, wherein he claimed to have had experience working as a government-backed undercover agent in addition to working later as an analyst and contractor for the NSA. 'I was trained as a spy in terms of the traditional sense of the word in that I lived and worked undercover, overseas, pretending to work in a job that I'm not, and even being assigned a name that was not mine,' he said to NBC. 'Now the government might deny these things, they might frame it in certain ways and say \"Oh, well he's a low-level analyst\" but what they're trying to do is they're trying to use one position that I've had in a career here or there to distract from the totality of my experience, which is that I've worked for the Central Intelligence Agency- undercover, overseas. I've worked for the National Security Agency- undercover, overseas- and I've worked at the Department of Defense as a lecturer at the joint-training\u00a0 academy where I developed sources and methods for keeping our people and information secure in the most hostile and dangerous environments across the world.' He went on to claim that before he turned over the documents to journalist Glenn Greenwald, he started to go through official channels to report his apparent concern over the NSA's surveillance programs. More evidence: Snowden said that he sent emails to his higher ups at the NSA before leaking, expressing his concerns, but the government took the unprecedented step on Thursday of releasing one email that went against his comments . In response, the government used their new Intelligence Community Tumblr to released one email that they had on file from Snowden. The email is dated April 8, 2013, and seems to be an inquiry about the definition of the scope of executive orders as dictated in part of his training. 'NSA has now explained that they have found one email inquiry by Edward Snowden to the Office of General Counsel asking for an explanation of some material that was in a training course he had just completed,' the IC On The Record Tumblr caption notes. 'The e-mail did not raise allegations or concerns about wrongdoing or abuse, but posed a legal question that the Office of General Counsel addressed.' Edward Snowden's email, dated Friday, April 5, 2013 . Hello, I have a question regarding the mandatory USSID 18 training. The training states the following: ----(U) The Hierarchy of Governing Authorities and Documents is displayed from the highest authority to the lowest authority as follows:U.S. ConstitutionFederal Statutes/Presidential Executive Orders (EO)Department of Defense (DoD) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) RegulationsNSA/CSS Directives and Policies\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 USSIDs\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SID Management Directives and Policies\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Office Policies----I'm not entirely certain, but this does not seem correct, as it seems to imply Executive Orders have the same precedence as law. My understanding is that EOs may be superceded by federal statute, but EOs may not override statute. Am I incorrect in this? Between EOs and laws, which have precedence?Similarly, between DOD and ODNI regulations, which has greater precedence? Could you please clarify?Thank you very much, Ed .

Using touch screen computers has helped a group of monkeys relax, a new study has found. Interacting with the touchscreen machines not only interests and challenges the animals, but keeps dominant members of the group busy, which mirrors life in the wild and relieves social tension. Researchers studied a social group of Sulawesi crested macaques at Marwell Wildlife, Hampshire, to come up with their findings. Researchers studied a social group of Sulawesi crested macaques at Marwell Wildlife Park to come up with their findings. Here, one of the dominant monkeys relaxes by playing with the touchscreen . The scientists, from the University of Portsmouth, taught the rare monkeys to operate computer touchscreens so they could conduct studies to understand the animals' cognition and communication. The researchers found that providing cognitive challenges for the macaques, using touchscreen computers, has improved the group\u2019s cohesion and reduced tensions while increasing friendly behaviour. Lead scientist on the study, Jamie Whitehouse, from the university\u2019s Department of Psychology, said: 'Having one individual leave the group mimics conditions in the wild when it\u2019s common for a lone macaque to break off and return later. The researchers found that providing cognitive challenges for the macaques, using touch screen computers, has improved the group\u00bfs cohesion and reduced tensions while increasing friendly behaviour . Natural habitat: Tropical forest and mangrove swamps . Diet: Bark, roots, bulbs, fruit and leaves; also, insects and other invertebrates, small reptiles and birds\u2019 eggs . Behaviour: The monkeys live in small groups on the forest floor. They signal to one another by using a variety of calls, facial expressions and by raising and lowering their crests . Threats: Hunting for food and habitat destruction . 'At Marwell it\u2019s usually the dominant macaques leaving the group to use the touchscreens, which leaves the others to enjoy some time without the top ranking animals.' Just like humans and many other primates, macaques use complex social interactions. Sulawesi crested macaques, native to Indonesia, employ sophisticated and subtle communication techniques, relying on many different facial expressions, body positioning and vocalisations to make themselves understood, according to the study published in the journal PLOS ONE. Mr Whitehouse said: 'We can use our understanding of their social behaviour to work out whether taking part in the studies is affecting their welfare.' The research shows that when dominant individuals leave the group, the \u2018lipsmacking\u2019 behaviour of the other macaques increases \u2013 where they protrude their lips and then smack them together repeatedly. The monkeys were able to choose between images and videos of their species displaying different facial expressions . Mr Whitehouse said: 'This behaviour is a friendly gesture between the macaques, which they use to maintain their social bonds. 'The fact that this increases on days when they are taking part in our studies, shows that our research is having a positive effect on the group.' The macaques live in their social group and can voluntarily enter a specialised research area, separate from the researcher. The animals are free to end the sessions whenever they like and return to their daily activities. They receive food treats \u2013 tiny amounts of healthy titbits \u2013 when they take part in the studies. The scientists plan on using their understanding of the monkey's social behaviour to work out whether taking part in the studies is affecting their welfare ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Touchscreen computers provided cognitive challenges to Sulawesi crested macaques, improving their social behaviour and increasing 'lipsmacking', a friendly gesture.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam are determined to keep the education of their 11-year-old son 'out of politics' Nick Clegg yesterday defended the possibility he may send his children to private schools as it emerged he and his wife Miriam have not even visited their local state school. He said the education of his 11-year-old son Antonio, who starts secondary school this year, should not be used as 'a political football' and that the couple would do 'what's best' for their children although he was braced for criticism. Last week the Liberal Democrat leader told listeners to his radio show he would send his son to a private school if he failed to find a place in a good comprehensive, saying he would use the state system 'if it works out', but that there is 'huge competition' for places in London. But Mr Clegg, who attended Westminster public school, has apparently not looked around nearby Ark Putney academy in south-west London, it was revealed yesterday by its headmaster Mark Phillips. Mr Phillips who has turned the school around since he was hired three years ago, said the school which was once in special measures but is now lauded by the Government for its improvements, could provide an 'exceptional' education for any child and that there was no need to pay fees for schooling. Unless the Cleggs had visited 'under cover' he had not seen them, he said.'I am always very clear that all parents living locally are welcome to choose our school and it is important that every parent comes with their child and takes an objective look to see whether what we offer will meet the needs of their child', he said. 'It wouldn't claim to be the answer to every child and every parent. But I hope that if a parent does come, and sees an environment their child will thrive in, they will pick us...I am confident they will do exceptionally well. I don't believe you have to pay for it.' Mr Clegg told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show yesterday that he and his wife will do whatever is in the interests of their son . If he chooses to educate his children . privately, Mr Clegg is likely to be accused of hypocrisy after using a . speech last year to attack 'the great rift in our education system' caused by many of the best schools being fee-paying and said it had a . 'corrosive' effect on society and the economy. In . an interview on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, he said: 'I accept that it's a . dilemma for anyone in public life, particularly in politics, how do you . balance that with the fact Miriam and I have small children, and the . approach Miriam and I took right from the outset was to keep our . children completely out of politics. 'We . never put them in front of the camera or to make them or their . education a political football. 'I totally accept that when we make a . decision that'll be subject to public commentary, criticism and so on, . but in the meantime we want to protect the privacy of an 11-year-old boy . and make the decision that we as parents think is best for our son.' The deadline for applying for entry to Ark Putney for 2013-14 was last October. The school is part of the Ark academy chain, set up in 2004, whose chairman is Paul Marshall, one of the Liberal Democrats' biggest donors. Last year 62 per cent of pupils gained at least five good GCSEs, prompting schools minister Nick Gibb to write to Mr Phillips to congratulate him on the 'excellent results' saying the school was in the top 100 best-performing, based on sustained improvements every year since 2008. However Michael Gove last year approved the sale of five acres of playing fields at the school including six tennis courts, a football pitch and a playground, to developers to fund refurbishments, after a \u00a340million revamp under the Building Schools for the Future programme was cancelled. Alumni of Ark Putney, which used to be Elliott School, include actor Pierce Brosnan, and 1960s England bowler Geoff Arnold.

'It\u2019s incredible to see at that stage of the game someone with the power to make that run and then the composure to finish as he did,' said the Barca coach of his tormentor.

If president Josep Bartomeu comes up with an acceptable candidate to replace Martino then he may save his own skin.

He latched on to Frank Lampard's hopeful volleyed through ball, shrugged off Mikael Silvestre before rounding Lukasz Fabianksi to roll the ball into an empty net. Ivory Coast international Drogba scored the winning goal against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup final and may get the chance to repeat the trick. Quintuple chasing United play Everton in the second semifinal, also at Wembley, on Sunday. Chelsea, who are a still challenging third in the Premier League and semifinals of the Champions League, showed their character after falling behind to Walcott's strike. The England international winger connected with a chipped cross from Kieran Gibbs and his effort took a cruel deflection off Ashley Cole's arm to beat Cech. Arsenal had made a fine start, but without injured central defender William Gallas and with Fabianski showing a lack of authority in goal, Chelsea came back strongly into the game. Malouda went close with a cross shot which eluded Fabianski, but he was not be denied soon afterwards as picked out by Lampard he cut inside Emmanuel Eboue and beat Fabianski at his near post. More slack defending from Denilson allowed Nicolas Anelka time to shoot and his shot hit the post with Fabianski beaten. Walcott looked occasionally dangerous on the flank and twice sent in crosses which might have been converted, but Chelsea looked the more threatening and the teams were spared extra time when Drogba powered through to score. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was left to rue their defensive errors and the performance of his 20-year-old Polish goalkeeper. \"He's a great goalkeeper but it was not his greatest day,\" Wenger said. \"Inexperience, yes. It was a game when any mistake could be costly.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Chelsea, coached by Guus Hiddink, triumphed over Arsenal 2-1 in the FA Cup semifinal.

The nation's lower house approved a marriage bill, which would also give same-sex couples the right to adopt, in a 331-to-225 final vote. They cast their votes after impassioned speeches by lawmakers for and against the legislation. President Francois Hollande, who pledged his support for same-sex marriage on the campaign trail last year, will have to sign the bill before it becomes law. After Tuesday's lower house vote, a group of senators filed a legal challenge with the country's Constitutional Council, according to a statement published on the UMP conservative opposition party's senate website. The court has a month to rule on the challenge filed by conservative and centrist senators. iReport: Pro-gay marriage demonstrators hail lawmakers' move . The measure had been expected to pass Tuesday since the left, which includes Hollande's governing Socialist Party, dominates the National Assembly, or lower house. The legislation was approved in the Senate earlier this month. If the measure is enacted, France would be the ninth country in Europe to allow same-sex marriage. Protesters on Sunday joined the latest in a series of marches through Paris against the measure, and they have vowed to carry on the fight. One of the groups behind the marchers urged protesters to rally again Tuesday evening and is planning more demonstrations around the country next month. Policing has been stepped up in the streets around the lower house in case demonstrations by those for and against the bill become heated, CNN affiliate BFM-TV reported. In France, the contentious debate over the same-sex marriage bill has coincided with a spike in reported incidents of homophobic abuse, the gay rights group SOS Homophobie told BFM-TV last week. A gay bar in Lille was targeted Wednesday night by four men who appeared to belong to a far-right group, Interior Minister Manuel Valls said Thursday, in a statement condemning the attack. Valls also condemned violence that broke out Thursday evening at a march against same-sex marriage, when \"organized groups\" refused to disperse and clashed with police. France is committed to upholding the right of all people to demonstrate peacefully, he said. International debate . Passage of the divisive bill will admit France to a small but growing club. Lawmakers in New Zealand last week made it the first country in the Asia Pacific region to legalize same-sex marriage. The law is set to be enacted later this year. Its move came a week after Uruguayan lawmakers approved a measure allowing same-sex marriage. The measure awaits the signature of Uruguay's president, who has indicated he supports it. If the laws in New Zealand, Uruguay and France are enacted as expected, the count of nations allowing same-sex marriage will rise to 14. The first same-sex couples walked down the aisle in the Netherlands in 2001, with others following suit in Canada, South Africa, Belgium and Spain. Argentina was the first Latin American nation to legalize such marriages, in 2010. Legislators in the United Kingdom are also weighing proposals to legalize same-sex marriage. However, many countries remain split over the issue. In the United States, the question went before the Supreme Court last month, and justices are now deliberating over the matter. Nine states and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, including three states -- Maryland, Washington, and Maine -- where voters approved it in ballot initiatives last year. Many states have specific laws blocking same-sex couples from legally marrying. Lawmakers in Australia voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. A poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64% of those surveyed \"support marriage equality.\" A law legalizing civil unions was introduced in 1999 in France under a previous Socialist government. Known in France as the PACS, or pacte civil de solidarite, the civil union agreement can be entered into by same-sex or straight couples and confers many but not all of the rights of marriage.

Diplomatic sources told CNN that a number of Arab nations are supplying arms to the Syrian opposition. The sources wouldn't identify which countries. In London, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton predicted the opposition will find willing sources to supply them with munitions to counter the Syrian government onslaught blamed for thousands of deaths since last March. \"There will be increasingly capable opposition forces,\" she said Thursday. \"They will find somewhere, somehow the means to defend themselves, as well as begin offensive measures and the pressure will build on Russia and China. World opinion is not going to stand idly by.\" Russia and China both vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have condemned the Syrian government for attacking its people. Also Thursday, U.S. officials told CNN they are considering providing the opposition with nonlethal aid -- such as secure radio communications and training. That is a step beyond what the Obama administration was saying Tuesday, when it was still clinging to the hope that political solutions would end the bloodshed. \"We don't believe that it makes sense to contribute now to the further militarization of Syria, what we don't want to see is the spiral of violence increase,\" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. \"That said, if we can't get Assad to yield to the pressure that we are all bringing to bear, we may have to consider additional measures.\" Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has recently suggested that, beyond humanitarian aid and diplomatic solutions, \"we need to think about contingencies as well.\" Both the U.S. military and intelligence community have expressed concern about providing arms to an opposition whose composition is unclear. The 70-plus countries and international organizations gathering Friday in Tunis are expected to unveil a plan for delivering emergency aid to the Syrian people and issue a stern warning to President Bashar al-Assad. They want him to agree to an immediate cease-fire and provide access to humanitarian groups to deliver the aid or face a yet-to-be mentioned response from the world community. A draft of the document, shared with CNN, calls on \"the Syrian government to implement an immediate cease-fire and to allow free and unimpeded access by the United Nations and humanitarian agencies to carry out a full assessment of needs in Homs and other areas.\" Diplomats cautioned the draft was subject to change. What's more, the communiqu\u00c3\u00a9 will recognize the opposition Syrian National Council, members of which will be at the session, as a credible representative of the Syrian people. The United States insists it will not provide weapons to the Syrian opposition, and will leave it to others who have expressed an interest in doing so. Nobody told Washington they armed the Libyans and officials said they expect the same nod-wink in Syria. Neither Russia, which is a Soviet-era ally and arms dealer to Syria, nor China is participating. Preparations for the Tunis meeting coincided with the release Thursday of a U.N. report that identifies Syrian commanders and high-ranking officials who may be responsible for \"widespread, systematic and gross human rights violations\" and apparent crimes against humanity. The violations have been conducted with the \"apparent knowledge and consent\" of the country's \"highest levels,\" the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic says. Thousands have died in Syria since mid-March of 2011, when the government launched a crackdown against protesters. At least 101 deaths were reported Thursday, including 14 children and a soldier killed when he refused to open fire on people, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Seventeen unidentified corpses were found in a military prison in the Zawiya Mountain area of Idlib province, the group said. Residents told the LCC they believe it's likely most of these unidentified bodies were of soldiers who had defected. Opposition forces reported more shelling of Homs, the 20th consecutive day of attacks on the besieged city at the center of resistance. On Thursday, the United Nations announced the appointment of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan as joint special envoy of the United Nations and Arab League on the Syrian crisis. Annan will be tackling an environment described by the U.N. commission report as one in which most of the citizenry is \"in a state of disarray.\" \"The government has manifestly failed in its responsibility to protect the population,\" the report says. \"Anti-government armed groups have also committed abuses, although not comparable in scale and organization with those carried out by the state.\" Meanwhile, Britain and France demanded Syrian President Bashar al-Assad cease attacks against Homs so three journalists can receive medical care, even as reports emerged Thursday of renewed shelling in the flashpoint city. The journalists were in Homs to document attacks by al-Assad's forces when they were wounded in shelling, which also killed American reporter Marie Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik. Al-Assad has denied targeting civilians, saying his forces are after \"terrorists\" and foreign fighters bent on destabilizing Syria. Evidence that civilians are being killed by government forces has been documented by citizen journalists who post their work on social media websites and YouTube. The opposition reports the death toll exceeds 9,000. CNN and other media outlets often cannot independently verify opposition or government reports because the Syrian regime has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists. The Syrian Foreign Ministry denied Syria was responsible for the deaths on Wednesday of two journalists \"who infiltrated its territory on their own,\" according to a banner on Syrian state TV. The British Foreign Office summoned Sami Khiyami, the Syrian ambassador to the United Kingdom, and Political Director Sir Geoffrey Adams said Syria was expected to facilitate the return of the bodies of the two journalists and to provide medical treatment to British photographer Paul Conroy. Conroy and French reporter Edith Bouvier of Le Figaro were wounded in the shelling in the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr. Bouvier said in a YouTube video that she needed immediate medical treatment. \"My leg is broken, the length of my femur. I need to be operated on as quickly as possible, the doctors have treated me as best as they can except they cannot perform any surgical operations, so I need as quickly as possible, during a cease-fire, a car with medical equipment or at least in good condition to take me to Lebanon to be treated as quickly as possible,\" she said. Dr. Mohammed Al-Mohammed, who has been treating the wounded journalists in Baba Amr, said Bouvier was in critical condition and Conroy had been moved to a \"safe house,\" which the physician said was a misnomer. \"The problem is that we don't have a safe place, anywhere secure, in Baba Amr,\" Al-Mohammed told CNN Thursday in an telephone interview. He bemoaned the lack of medical supplies. \"We just have the basics,\" he said. \"I have to admit, all very primitive.\" CNN's Elise Labott, Hamdi Alkhshali, Brian Walker, Arwa Damon, Hala Gorani, Tom Watkins and Joe Sterling contributed to this report."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Arab nations arm Syrian opposition, U.S. mulls nonlethal aid.

An Islamist fighter mans a position in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia, on Saturday. Jowhar is a major town 55 miles (88 kilometers) southeast of Mogadishu, the capital. \"All businesses are closed and residents are already fleeing while Al-Shabab are roaming the streets,\" a local journalist said. The town had been under the control of forces backing the transitional government, which is scrambling to cope with deadly advances from Al-Shabab in Mogadishu. Al-Shabab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006. The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, and the U.S. backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006. After seizing control of Jowhar on Sunday, the rebels started conducting \"search operations in the police station and the provincial headquarters of the town,\" the journalist added. The clashes extended into the suburbs of the town, where sporadic fighting was going on between the rebels and government forces, said the journalist, who requested anonymity for safety reasons. The town's seizure comes amid escalating tension between Somalia's transitional government and the Al-Shabab militia, which has waged days-long attacks in the capital. In the latest round of violence, one person was killed and 15 others wounded when mortars slammed into a police academy in Mogadishu on Sunday. Clashes between the rebels and the government in Mogadishu have left at least 103 people dead and 420 wounded, Somali officials said Friday. The east African nation has not had an effective government since 1991. Last week, a spokesman for the rebel group said that it had successfully recruited more fighters. \"It is not only Somali jihadists that are fighting in Mogadishu against the government,\" said Sheikh Hassan Ya'qub, a spokesman for Al-Shabab. \"There are also foreign Muslim jihadist brothers who are fighting side by side with us.\" The new round of fighting stems from an interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law, the spokesman said. Somalia's new president, Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, recently approved implementing sharia, but the rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form. Meanwhile, a powerful Islamist warlord defected to the government Saturday after he disagreed with rebel Islamist groups on the war against the transitional government. The warlord, Sheikh Yusuf Mohamud Siad Indha Ade, was the military commander of Hassan Dahir Aweys, who is suspected by the United States of being a terrorist."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Al-Shabab, linked to al Qaeda, has seized Jowhar and recruited more fighters, escalating tension with Somalia's transitional government.

In worrying lapses in data security, sensitive paper records have been dumped in public bins and electronic records found for sale on an internet auction site. The worst cases include details of terminally ill patients being faxed to the wrong number, and patient records being stolen and posted on to the internet. Worrying: The serious data security lapses have included files on a terminally ill patient being faxed to the wrong number . The total is the equivalent of nearly 5,000 records going missing every day. But the real figure is likely to be much higher because in some incidents it was not known exactly how many records were lost. In addition, at present the data protection watchdog relies on hospitals declaring when data has gone missing. Such is the scale of the problem that the watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, is asking for powers to conduct compulsory audits on hospitals and NHS trusts. The Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, has levied fines totalling nearly \u00a31million on NHS bodies in the last six months. And last night his office warned that more would follow if data protection rules continue to be breached. The figures were compiled from reports of Data Protection Act breaches filed by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office in the 12 months from July 2011 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Over the year a total of 1,779,597 records were reported lost in 16 major incidents involving NHS bodies. In .

(Posed by model) Another database contained the names and dates of birth of more than 1,500 HIV positive patients. It later emerged that 232 hard drives that should have been destroyed had been sold on the auction site. They also contained highly sensitive personal data of tens of thousands more patients and staff including test results, medical conditions and children\u2019s reports. Belfast Health and Social Care Trust was fined \u00a3225,000 in June after 100,000 confidential paper records were dumped at a disused hospital site. Trespassers gained access to the site and copies of records \u2013 which dated from the 1950s \u2013 were posted on the internet. Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust was fined \u00a390,000 in April for faxing 59 patient records containing \u2018confidential and sensitive\u2019 data to the wrong number so they ended up with a member of the public. The records belonged to terminally ill patients receiving palliative care and included medical diagnoses, information about patients\u2019 home lives and their resuscitation instructions. In October last year University Hospital, Coventry was warned after 19 patient records were found dumped in a bin. A midwife in Poole was warned after her car was broken into and thieves stole patient diaries which contained sensitive personal data about 240 pregnant women in her care. Hospitals have also been found sending mental health patient records to the wrong patient because he had a similar name. The worst breach involved a CD containing 1.6million patient records, including personal details, belonging to Eastern and Coastal Kent PCT. The CD was lost when a filing cabinet went missing during an office move. The trust was not fined, but signed an undertaking with the ICO not to repeat the error. Other cases around the country have involved unsecured laptops stolen from the home of a staff member. Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: \u2018These figures may be shocking, but they will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the NHS\u2019s track record for dealing with patient data. \u2018Across the NHS there are some excellent organisations who are addressing this problem well but some of the poor performers are terrifying. \u2018There is a real risk that if the NHS doesn\u2019t sort out how it looks after patients\u2019 details people will stop sharing information with their doctor and that could be extremely dangerous for care.\u2019 The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office said: \u2018The Health Service holds some of the most sensitive personal information available, so it\u2019s vitally important that patients\u2019 information is being kept secure.\u2019"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The NHS lost 1.8 million patient records in a year, with sensitive data found online and in public bins.

Chevron CEO David O'Reilly says his company's profit is about 7 percent. Kennedy: The fastest way for us to solve our energy problems in this country is immediate conservation. If we improve fuel economy standards in our automobiles by one mile per gallon, we generate twice the oil that's in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. If we raise fuel economy standards by 7.6 miles per gallon, we can yield more oil than we are currently importing from the Persian Gulf. O'Reilly: I agree, that first of all efficiency is the very first thing we ought to be working on. And there are new [fuel efficiency] standards in place that will obligate the automobile manufacturers to be more efficient and, in fact, you can see a shift already toward more efficient cars.

We can do that in this country, too, using shifting to electricity and electricity gives us a lot more versatility, it allows us to harness wind.

We have enough harnessable wind energy in North Dakota, Kansas and Texas combined to supply all the electrical needs of our country, even if every American were driving an electric car. We have the Scientific American just published a report that shows in 19 percent of the most barren desert lands in the desert Southwest, we have enough solar energy to provide all the electrical needs of our country. ... What we need now is a national policy that says, OK, let's go out and get those electrons and get them into the marketplace. O'Reilly: I encourage all these alternatives. I think there's room for all of them. I'm very concerned because the reality is today that these alternatives are a very small percentage. And just like it takes a long time to drill an offshore well, it takes a long time to find and develop and put in the sort of equipment that Mr. Kennedy is talking about.

When I was a little boy, our country owned half the wealth on the face of the Earth. We are now transferring that wealth at a historic rate to other countries, again, mainly nations that don't like us. We have solutions. Unfortunately, we have a Congress that's really brain dead. I'll tell you something that the Congress did today. First of all, they killed the investment tax credits for solar and wind which are absolutely vital to the growth of this burgeoning industry. Second of all, today, Congress and the White House declared a moratorium, a two-year moratorium on any solar plants being built on federal lands while they study supposedly the environmental impact. O'Reilly: In the first quarter, we made $5 billion, which is 7 percent of sales and exactly the median for all of the industry. ... The percentage has been about the same.

Marjorie Margolies, a former congresswoman and mother-in-law to former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, crashed and burned in a bid to return to the House of Representatives on Tuesday, losing her Democratic primary in a landslide. Her epic Pennsylvania loss to state Rep. Brendan Boyle came despite campaign fundraising appearances by both Bill and Hillary Clinton, who couldn't push her above a 27 per cent showing in a four-way race. Margolies has courted controversy since 1993 when, in her first and only term in Congress, she cast the deciding vote in favor of then-President Bill Clinton's tax-raising 1993 budget. Marjorie Margolies conceded the election for the Democratic nomination in Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District on Tuesday, losing in a landslide despite endorsements and fundraising help from Bill and Hillary Clinton . Happy couple: Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky merged the two political families with troubled pasts, and Marc's mother's political flame-out will add new tensions . Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton turned an April fundraiser for Margolies into a mini campaign launch for herself, raising $200,000 for her son-in-law's mother but test-ballooning 2016 campaign issues at the same time . Republicans chanted 'Bye bye Marjorie' on the House floor, knowing her political life would take a hit since she had promised her constituents that she would never raise their taxes. Shortly after she lost her seat in the 1994 midterm election that swept Newt Gingrich and more than 50 other conservatives into power, she got a consolation prize in the form of a $600,000 grant for her charity, Women's Campaign International, from Bill Clinton's USAID. Part of Margolies' political baggage was linked to that charity. In 2001 after her husband, former Democratic Rep. Ed Mezvinsky, was indicted for investor fraud, Margolies lost everything \u2013 her property was liquidated to reimburse her husband's victims more than $10 million, and a judge refused to let her declare bankruptcy. She then doubled her own salary into six-figure territory, made a move to pay for a mansion for her to live in and billed it for a leased car. She also reportedly forced the charity's staffers to double as personal assistants to help her at a university where she taught. A pregnant Chelsea Clinton showed off her baby bump as she arrived in Los Angeles on Wednesday; her mother-in-law lost a congressional primary bid on Tuesday . Bill and Hillary Clinton both personally headlined fundraisers for Margolies, and they appeared together in a campaign commercial made near the end of the primary run. Hillary's appearance in April, however, appeared less focused on Margolies than on herself. The candidate didn't show up, and Mrs. Clinton road-tested campaign themes for the 2016 presidential election.

Khodorkovsky \"is grateful for the principled positions taken by the Swiss authorities over the many years of his unjust imprisonment,\" read the statement. \"Swiss judicial authorities were quick to recognise the politicised nature of Mr. Khodorkovsky's prosecution.\" According to the statement, \"the purpose of his visit is a family matter, as he and his wife are accompanying their two sons back to school in Switzerland.\" Khodorkovsky has two twin sons studying in a Swiss school. Khodorkovsky and his wife traveled by train from Berlin, where they have been since Khodorkovsky's release. After Russian President Vladimir Putin's December pardon, the country's Supreme Court will take a second look at cases against Khodorkovsky, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. The court cited the European Court of Human Rights' criticism of the tax evasion and fraud case. The statement said Khodorkovsky has not made plans for permanent residency in Switzerland. Russia has faced international criticism for its treatment of Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, with countries including the United States accusing it of selective prosecution and abuse of the legal system. Khodorkovsky's release was one of dozens, part of Putin's new amnesty law that some critics have described as a public relations campaign ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. In past statements to CNN, Khodorkovsky has said his prosecution was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take control of Yukos, the oil company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s.

Is that right?\" So begins the exchange between actor Kevin James and the automated phone system in the 2007 film \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry\" -- a scene that correctly assumes moviegoers have had personal experience with the absurdity of non-human customer service. Who hasn't? We've all waited through the recitation of menu items, none of which were related to our actual question. We've all hit zero repeatedly, hoping to be transferred to a real person. When that didn't work, maybe we even lost our temper, shouting \"Representative!\" over and over, whether the robot had given us that option or not. Why hasn't there been a mass revolt against automated systems? The answer is simple: We believe that this nonsense is temporary. We believe that computers are on the cusp of being able to understand human language. And that belief, according to many linguists and cognitive scientists, is completely wrong. First, there's the problem of voice recognition itself. Julie Sedivy, a professor of linguistics and psychology at the University of Calgary, told me that simply recognizing speech sounds and matching them up with specific words is much more complicated than most people realize. \"The way I say 'dog' will depend on my age, gender, geographic dialect, the particular anatomy of my vocal tract, and how quickly or formally I'm speaking,\" she said. \"Humans are able to calibrate their perception after hearing just a couple of seconds of someone's speech, but really good speech recognition is still a problem for many programs.\" Although this technology has steadily improved for the past 20 years, \"speech recognition systems are still markedly inferior to human beings in understanding spoken language,\" said John Nerbonne, a linguist and information sciences professor based in The Netherlands. \"Telephones are a particularly difficult medium because they limit the signal a good deal.\" Furthermore, studies show that people almost universally hate automated phone systems, and that most customers are even willing to pay more to speak to an actual person. \"Ally Bank,  Discover Card and TD Bank  all have ads on television right now that brag about the fact that if you call the phone number, a real live person will answer,\" said Adam Goldkamp, spokesperson for GetHuman, an organization dedicated to improving customer service. Such is the sad state of the current customer service world. In other words, only now are companies starting to wake up to the lost revenue potential of frustrated customers who give up on the automated system and take their business elsewhere. \"When you see companies launching ads like these, it shows they understand that there are things they can do to increase their future revenue by giving customers what they want: an actual person to speak to when they have an issue,\" Goldkamp said. Maybe one day in the future, automated systems will be able to identify our words with perfect accuracy. Even then, there is still an insurmountable problem: the ability to understand what we mean by those words. \"We're a long way from being able to communicate with computers in real language,\" said Suzanne Kemmer, director of Cognitive Sciences and associate professor of Linguistics at Rice University. \"Human language has a powerful design feature that works great for normal person-to-person interactions, but is completely at odds with the way computers work.\" Computers are based on formal logic and fixed categories, she explained. Human language is flexible and dynamic, and follows a cognitive logic that differs fundamentally from computers. In short, human words and grammatical structures don't have fixed meanings. Instead, they have a certain amount of vagueness and ambiguity built in, so that their meaning is highly affected by context. Actually understanding meaning is a very different problem from voice recognition or from the auto-correct on your computer or phone, Kemmer said. When I brought up this topic with Harvard professor Steven Pinker, one of the world's most influential linguists, he noted that major companies, by looking for statistical patterns in large datasets and applying them to user input, have largely dropped the ball when it comes to real artificial intelligence: \"The stupidity of a lot of computer language understanding systems comes from the fact that they've turned their backs on genuine intelligence and satisfied themselves with statistics.\" In other words, computers are still very bad at trying to guess what we mean when we say something. They also don't get our social and emotional psychology. \"Often the automated phone systems were developed with a tin ear to the way people interact with each other,\" Pinker told me. \"They sound like people, but if you think of them as such, they are the most infuriating people in the world. When I hit '0' to get a human being, and a voice dripping with a combination of mock concern and mock confusion says, 'I'm sorry, but I did not understand your answer,' I am apt to go into a rage.\" \"If this were a real person,\" Pinker added, \"she would be simultaneously stupid, mendacious, and condescending.\" It's time to stop the madness. We are not on the cusp of inventing computers that understand human language. Silicon Valley can, and will, continue to strive for this goal. In the meantime, let's stop kidding ourselves. Let's admit that computers, by themselves, are terrible at customer service. Let's admit that, at a time of economic uncertainty and job losses, we should be supporting companies that employ real people to answer our questions. Let's admit that, unless we demand change, we will be forced, forever, to deal with an automated system that thinks our name is Barry Shmalenpine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David R. Wheeler."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Linguistics professors Julie Sedivy and Suzanne Kemmer, along with Harvard professor Steven Pinker, critique the limitations of automated phone systems in understanding human language.

This will eventually reach some of the 100,000 displaced people in Rakhine state who have been forced from their homes after violence swept through their communities in 2012. Q&A: What's behind sectarian violence in Myanmar? In the town of Sittwe, the violence has divided the once peaceful ethnic Rakhine and Muslim communities, turning friends into enemies and driving neighbors into exile. At first glance the town appears peaceful, and the streets are bustling with people visiting shops and restaurants. But just a short drive from the town center the landscape alters with relief camps and NGO vehicles, the telltale sign that we are reaching our destination. Mozala camp houses 573 people from ethnic Rakhine communities in temporary bamboo shelters. The Red Cross is bringing in drinking water as part of its emergency relief program that distributes 8,000 liters of safe water to camps each day. The water is a lifeline for the people living in this camp. One of the residents tells me that despite other water tanks nearby, this is the only water safe for drinking. Terrorized, starving and homeless: Myanmar's Rohingya still forgotten . The cool weather in Sittwe is a shock after the oppressive heat of Yangon where we are based. People in the camps tell me they are already concerned about flooding when it rains. The tattered sandbags piled outside shelters do little to prevent the muddy, dirty water from flowing inside. In a few more months the rainy season will arrive in earnest. Will these families still be here? We visit a Muslim camp situated further out of the main town. Because of the violence and continued tensions, the camps are divided to separately house the ethnic Rakhine and Muslim communities. Read more: Obama lauds Aung San Suu Kyi, gives a nod to Myanmar . The car pulls up along the side of a busy road where a large queue is already forming outside a clinic. Red Cross volunteers inside are treating Faranarli, 14, who was in a cycling accident. His bandaged ankle covers a series of severe cuts, and he winces, as the volunteers carefully take off the bandage to clean and dress the wounds. The Red Cross is supporting health clinics in more than 10 camps, treating patients from both communities. The need for these services is evident. Mothers are clutching babies with skin complaints, and men with bandaged arms are leaning against the fragile bamboo shelter. In this dusty and crowded camp, cuts and grazes can quickly become infected, and with limited toilets and a lack of sanitation facilities, diseases can quickly spread. The Red Cross has built toilets and wells in this camp to help respond to some of the health and sanitation challenges. Volunteers have the unenviable task of regularly disinfecting the toilets with chlorine powder. The Red Cross team has been drafted from other parts of the country to help respond to substantial needs. Read more: What a difference a year makes in Myanmar . The 30 volunteers, who come for a month, live and sleep together in a small shelter in Sittwe. The conditions are basic, the work is hard, but there are no complaints. Soon a new rotation will arrive, and these teammates will return home, back to their communities, jobs and normal day-to-day lives -- an impossible reality now for the thousands of displaced families in Rakhine. The humanitarian crisis in Rakhine first erupted in June 2012, meaning many of the families we have met over the last few days have been living in camps for up to seven months. As time passes, greater priority is being placed on providing adequate temporary shelters for families unable to return home. Several hundred \"long houses\" -- temporary shelters which house eight to 10 families -- have already been built. These shelters can be seen in some of the camps we visited, but there are still not enough for the entire displaced population. In the coming months the Myanmar Red Cross plans to support the construction of up to 160 temporary shelters. While the longterm solutions to this crisis remain unclear, the need for drinking water, food, shelter and medical care are very evident. As dislocated families continue to cope with life away from home and their livelihoods, it is critical that humanitarian assistance continues to reach people in both Rakhine and Muslim communities."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In Myanmar's Rakhine state, Red Cross volunteer Tin Tin Wae aids displaced people, including Faranarli, a 14-year-old accident victim.

For North Korea watchers, the all too real political theater playing out in Pyongyang may offer another tantalizing glimpse behind the opaque curtain of the North Korean regime, but raises more questions than answers. Depending on how you read the signs, the execution of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's uncle and formerly trusted regent, Jang Song Thaek, either shows a young leader further cementing his control, or the first death throes of a regime teetering on collapse. In the absence of any independently verifiable information, and in a regime where paranoid rhetoric is the normal register of almost all diplomatic language, any conjecture is likely to be as accurate as it is to be wide of the mark. North Korea: Leader's 'traitor' uncle executed . For Jasper Kim, the founder of the Asia-Pacific Global Research Group, North Korea remains for analysts a \"Rubik's Cube that no one can solve.\" He said North Korea is a master at carefully choreographing the way it releases news events to cloak its real intentions. Nevertheless, he said a careful reading between the lines of North Korean new agency KCNA sometimes reveals glimpses of the state of the regime. He said that far from asserting the leadership of Kim, recent events suggest that his position has been seriously eroded by the execution of his uncle. \"My guess is that these events happened some time ago and they are only now being released,\" Kim told CNN. \"The fact is that we don't know what's going on in North Korea but what we are seeing coming through on KCNA is very concerning. \"When you look at the language used in these KCNA reports it is particularly hawkish and it's much more reflective of the military than it is of Kim Jong Un. \"Basically we are seeing the hardline faction reassert itself. For Kim Jong Un, Jang Song Thaek was the bridge between him and his father, and now he will have very little protection.\" He said that North Korea, famous for tightly controlling the drip feed of real information coming out of the country, was now sending out violently mixed messages. \"The recent release of the prisoner (Merrill Newman) and this execution couldn't be more at odds; what this indicates is that it's a chaotic situation in there,\" he added. \"What this points to in terms of regime change is that it's a question of 'when' rather than 'if.' \"What history tells us is that when it does happen it will be unexpected and extreme and everyone must be prepared for the worst case scenario.\" For Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul, however, the purge of Jang shows a young leader consolidating his grip on power. \"Some of the reasons are quite obvious and very transparent and many predicted that this was going to happen. What is really surprising is how it happened. Pretty much everybody expected that in the near future a state head would be removed from power,\" Lankov told CNN. \"But people did not expect that it would happen in such a dramatic and theatrical manner.\" He said that Jang's removal and execution displayed the deadly manner of generational political change in North Korea. \"Kim Jong Un became the leader of the country after only one year of being a kind of anointed successor. He has had no time to create his own team, so he's had no choice but to rely on the team from his father and this team consists of people who are in their 60s and 70s and sometimes even older. He said that this politburo consisted of men who could be Kim's father or even grandfather. \"Imagine how difficult it is to run a country -- especially one with a strong Confucian tradition -- when all your senior advisers are older than you. And these are people who can have very different ideas of goals and strategies. \"It was clear from the first days of his rule that he would remove most of the people around him. Jang was particularly vulnerable exactly because he was initially appointed by late Kim Jong Il to be a regent -- the chief adviser to the young ruler. \"But being a regent is a dangerous job. The king gets older and he feels more and more irritation and to hold more of a grudge against these noisy, strange, grumpy old men. \"For a regent, it's very good to know when to retire but not everyone is smart enough.\" Opinion: How Kim purged his uncle ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The execution of Jang Song Thaek, Kim Jong Un's uncle, has stirred debate about North Korea's stability.

He was the world\u2019s best bowler. On Tuesday night, he will be at Woodhorn Lane football ground in his hometown of Ashington, a rookie manager making his dugout debut in the Ebac Northern League. It is all a far cry from those heady days of 2005 when Harmison was a guest of the Prime Minister and one of the most famous sportsmen in the country. Former England bowler Steve Harmison has been named as manager of non-League\u00a0Ashington . Harmison played a key role in helping England win the Ashes ten years ago . But football has always been his first love. His dad, Jimmy, played for Yeovil Town in the Conference and his brother, James, is now on the books of Bedlington Terriers. Growing up in the former mining town of Ashington \u2013 home to Jackie Milburn and World Cup winners Jack and Bobby Charlton \u2013 he was surrounded by footballing folklore from a young age. Harmison himself was a player under Newcastle United\u2019s current boss, John Carver, at the club\u2019s school of excellence during the early Nineties. In fact, the sight of the former Test star at St James\u2019 Park \u2013 where he was honoured with a seat for life following the Ashes triumph \u2013 or on the touchline of a Northern League ground is very much a familiar one in these parts. What will be unfamiliar, however, is watching the 36-year-old patrol his technical area when ninth-tier Ashington AFC take on Bishop Auckland this evening. Harmison established himself as one of the world's best bowlers during his time in Cricket . The club's average gate is 200 but 500 are expected for the unveiling of Harmison, whose part-time role pays a token wage to cover expenses and will involve at least two weeknight training sessions and Saturday matches. But Harmison \u2013 who has the full support of wife, Hayley, and their four children \u2013 believes he has a long-term future in the game and insists his appointment is no publicity stunt. \u2018Anyone who knows me understands that football has always been first,\u2019 he tells Sportsmail ahead of his venture into management. \u2018Northern League football is something I have watched since I was old enough to walk - not many people have watched more non-league games than I have. Harmison was known as the Ashington Express during his playing days and is a Newcastle fan . Harmison has taken the surprise move to go into football management following his retirement from cricket . \u2018I played until I was 16 at Ashington but had to stop to concentrate on cricket. But because of my family \u2013 my dad, brother and uncles all played \u2013 I\u2019ve always been around football dressing-rooms. \u2018This opportunity presented itself and it felt right. The club has solid foundations but they needed a change with some fresh ideas and I\u2019ve got a fantastic team with me (coaches Ian Skinner and Lee Anderson). \u2018I can assure you one thing, this is anything but a publicity stunt. We are in it for the right reasons. It certainly isn\u2019t for financial gain. \u2018The club has so much going for it and we want to be part of that. I know the league and I know what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re in a bit of a relegation fight but I\u2019m excited by it. \u2018Who knows what the future holds for me? I\u2019m going to start my coaching badges this summer. By that point I will have a better understanding of management and the experience of a few months in the job.\u2019 Harmison (left) chats with Flintoff prior to Lancashire Lightning's match with Yorkshire Vikings in July 2014 . Harmison\u2019s own playing days are behind him. Indeed, he says the club wouldn\u2019t have a strip big enough to fit him now. But already he has been on the phone using his contacts to bring in some new faces. So what sort of manager will Harmison be? \u2018If you have played a professional sport at the top level then those core values transfer \u2013 a winning mentality and demanding certain standards,\u2019 he says. \u2018I was always different in my professional career as a cricketer. If I didn\u2019t agree with something then I would speak up, I was my own man. I will be honest with the players and will challenge them. \u2018I want to build a team. I want people to come back and watch us, to make it as happy a club as it can be. This is my hometown and this means a lot to me, I want to make a difference.\u2019 Harmison breaks off as his four kids return from school. He has tea to make and then a round of phone calls to see which players are available. \u2018I\u2019ve only got about eight fully fit players at the moment,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019ve had a text from Michael Vaughan asking \u201cwhich position do you want me to play?\u201d.\u2019 While Vaughan may joke, Harmison is deadly serious when it comes to his new career. So who are Ashington? A non-league football club who play in the Northumberland town of Ashington, located about 15 miles north of Newcastle. Founded in 1883, they are known as 'The Colliers' and play in the Northern Football League Division One. What level is that? It is level nine on the English league pyramid - for this part of the country, the Premier League is level one, then Championship, League One, League Two, Conference, Conference North, Northern Premier League, Northern Premier League Division One North and then Ashington's league. They pit themselves against the likes of Bedlington Terriers, Whitley Bay and Sunderland Ryhope Community Association. Where do they play? At Woodthorn Lane, which has a capacity of about 2,000. The club moved there in 2008 and their record attendance for a competitive fixture is 904 for a league game with Darlington in March 2013. What are their colours? Black and white stripes, similar to Newcastle United's. Have they ever won anything? They have twice won the league below their present one and are 10 times winners of the Northumberland Senior Cup, the latest coming in 2013. Their furthest run in the FA Cup came way back in 1926-27, when they played Nottingham Forest in the third round."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Steve Harmison, former England bowler, now manages Ashington AFC, a ninth-tier club in a relegation fight.

Germany are a good side and probably the team to watch out for, but with them you can catch them in different form throughout the tournament. They often start strong but then tend to drop off a little bit towards the end. We might be able to play them before the tournament to gauge how they are. France are another enigma \u2013 they came second in the Worlds in 2010 and then bottom of the Europeans the next year and went down a division. But they\u2019ve worked their way back up and could be tricky. Spain are like Germany and can be the best team in the world or implode, but we always seem to play well against them so I think we\u2019ll be OK. As for Poland, they have got weaker over the past few years and the Czech Republic, I won\u2019t lie, I\u2019ve never seen them play! That\u2019 s because they\u2019ve not been in the top division for a while but we\u2019ll have to be wary of them.
